Sunbeam cut through the tiny interior of a dim and foggy Shaman's tent.
A dirty face peered from behind the coyote skins that were covering the entrance.

"Are you coming in or not?" said the weary and sligtly annoyed voice. It was very hot inside, and a small fire that was burning in the center of the tent wasn't helpting.

Ugu entered. He was dressed in skins and leather, wooden club attached to his belt. In his hands he was carrying several dead rabbits.

"So you're the hunter I take it?" A man sitting in front of the fire looked pretty young for a shaman. He wore simple black clothes, and a grim expression on his face.

"How... how did you know?" Ugu was staring at the shaman in bewilderment.

"I'm a shaman, is that not clear? Spirits told me, of course. So what do you want?"

Ugu gaped at him for a while, then put his dead rabits into a pile of other gifts, and cautiously and respectfully sat down in front of the fire. 

"Ehm... I need your help, err.. shaman?"

"Kyle is my name. So what do you want?"

" 




Untidy black hair, goatee.
He wore black jeans, simple dark shirt, and a grim expression on his face.

Harry was sitting at the Ravenclaw table when black haired girl came up to him.  
** <2015-01-25 Sun>
Kyle jumped to the right, dodging the bite of a mutated rat.
His crowbar, covered in what was left of his previous enemies, was shaking in his hands.
Right behind him was a narrow river with ominously looking black water.
In front of him, as far as the eye could see, were the lifeless postapocaliptic wastelands.
Well, almost lifeless.
Between him and his home - only visible as a dim shape of several hills in the distance -
was a group of nuclear rats. Group or a pack? Or a pride?
Very soon they would be nothing. Because 3 rats were already lying on the ground lifeless,
and the remaining 4 were looking more and more hesitant to attack.

Rats were pretty useless, clever animals, but too aggressive.
Despite Kyle's attempts, the project of domesticating these creatures hasn't been a very successfull one.

*** Singularity outline
Solving OM and singularity today!!
- Bottom-um procedural code-style singularity draft
+ Complete one of the drafts and turn it into a post.

Where do they gather.
Okay.
in this version they rent something like a co-working space from the dude.
Dude? Maybe inherited it from somebody, maybe made enough money to buy it, whatevre,
doesn't mater right now.

How does it look like?
Co-working office?
Or house?

Again - DON"T be shy to copy.
Go for what's more awesome.

House is more awesome.
Dude has it in New York.
Inherited or something.
And created an ad - come here, rent my space, blah blah blah.
Seth. Yes, name of the dude is seth right now.

Kyle, Scientist(name? Mike. Works. Don't linger, not important, biggest steps.) and Alice move in.

Kyle and Mike are friends from college.

Alice? Sister? Somebody they've hired? She knew about them and decided to join?
How did she knew? Maybe she's into Kyle or probably not.

Ok. Alice meeting Kyle and mike is a separate story, I'll figure it out.

So.
- Kyle and Mike meet in college.
- Alice joins them - separate story
- They all want to work in high-tech(robotics), which attracts them together (<<<< !!)
  but now just miserable webdev.
- They find a place, the house, which is in a perfect location and all. Seth rents it.

Got it. So they are living together, dreaming about high-tech, working on webdev temporarily.
Kyle is the leader.

Meanwhile, not far from them David(Amber works for him) are owning it at the kind of thing these guys dream of doing.

Computer vision for drones.
For now(procedurally), this is what his company does. Drones. Totally.

Now Max.
- Finds them how?
- Proposes what?
  
Okay, again, for now(need a word/symbol for that, procedural answer up to changing. #pin), he just finds them through the same ad/bulletin(how is it called?)

Assuming there's one more place in there. And also this house is really cool(for reasons, #pin).
It is so cool that Max maybe forces his place into it.

At the moment we begin, them working together is a back story.
Max joins them and that's where that begins.

So!!
Main questions:
- What could they need that would piss David off?
Max realizes that they need it, proposes it, they go, recruit Amber(David is possibly in love with her, she just isn't), she betrays him, he is pisssed, destroys them, and they are left struggling. And that's where they begin to hack.
Maybe Max even goes - hey guys, I got you into this, I can help you get out of it.

Kyle desperately wants to be in high tech, David is in the high tech. There's an answer there.
Kyle is sick of doing webdev.

Lets say he wanted to develop a product for drones.
YES!! He didn't want to steal the technology, he wanted to be the first on the market!!!!
David's company produces drones.
Their big product is coming up, like a google driverless car or something, big size.
Maybe freaking drone taxi or some such.
And Kyle is sick of webdev, and desperately wants the startup in this field!!
And he knows that if he can develop a product for that - he is in, he will dominate it!!
He does /not/ need to steal the technology, but he does need the source code and plans of drones, so he could start developing for them!!
THAT is what they discuss, and THAT is what Max proposes to do!!!!
YES.
Got it.

So!!
- Kyle and Mike meet in college.
- Alice joins them - separate story
- They all want to work in high-tech(robotics), which attracts them together (<<<< !!)
  but now just miserable webdev.
- They find a place, the house, which is in a perfect location and all. Seth rents it.

They all dream about high-tech, Kyle is sick of working for webdev, it's a temporary gig,
dead-end. They NEED to get into robotics. Plus that is the reason Alice/Kyle are with him.
They don't "expect" it from them, but he knows that it's the reason they're with him.

David's company coming up with a driverless-drone-taxi soon.
Fucking huge product, and in the field of their dreams - robotics, opencv, all that.
Their chance to break in(especially as webdev goes worse and worse, and they almost abandon it completely, betting everythign on this product, have been developing it for a while now, and now need to know some inside information).

Max is a self-taught hacker but NOT a superheroe. Which is why they fail, and which is why they all struggle with hacking even wth him on board. He is clever and knows a lot, but is still young and compared to true pros(who work for David) isn't that good. But arrogant optimistic and confident(which is why he tries. But not stupidly though).
He moves into New York, because that's the dream and everything.
By the way that might be a reason they are in NY and not in Silicon Valley. And David?
Whatever, he has a huge tech company in NY. If it's fine for Tony Stark to be in NY, it's fine for David too, he is not exactly a startup, it is a Massive Dynamics like R&D company.
So. Max moves into the NY, finds this house - for the same reason all these guys do, it is attractive to them for reasons.
//(are there such houses in NY?) Works for now.
He gets his way in.
//Max works as a consultant/hacker or some such, not important.

Kyle, Mike and Alice discuss how badly they need to know how these drones work for their product to work. Or maybe they were developing a general product, but now it's a huge enormous opportunity to them. It is also clear that Kyle is fucking sick of the dumbass webdev, he is young and ambitious and dreams about high-tech and everything.
(by the way, this is why it can be so funny, when I come up with legit projects for them - make clients retarded and projects ridiculous. Like a cookie recepie website. And Kyle, this hardcore badass talking to that half-crazy old lady. Just grim look on his face. Cookies? REALLY?! Goddamit motherfucker!! Maybe dude is the only one who helps them to get through this).
Yes. So there's this cookie-client. I'm done with this, not tolerable anymore, we NEED to break in on this opportunity.
And Max overhears that(maybe they're not too friendly att this point, probably he has forced his way in or such) goes like - Here's an idea. I know a way of getting into the David's company.

Does he know amber or recruit her?
Amber is definitely not the dumb blonde to be seduced, but let's put a pin on that too, there definitely is a way.
So. Max recruits Amber.
They all begin an operation to get the drones source-code(#wv - working procedural version?).
Amber helps them.
It would be not even be such a big deal(illegal, but nothing too horrible, especially considering the intentions), but(?) on top of all that David is in love with Amber, and they get her to betray him(maybe more serious than that, maybe it /is/ very illegal).
So they get caught, and David knows what they were trying to do, what they really want, and knows that Amber betrayed him.

So David:
- Fires Amber - fuck you.
- Says to Kyle that he will destory his dream, he will NEVER work in high-tech/drones,
  he will make it his personal mission to crush every attempt Kyle has, David has resources to make superior version of his products and dominate it, etc, there are many ways.
- Says to Max that he is also screwed somehow. 
  Maybe Max is also hacker on the side. Maybe he even wanted to work for a company like David's!
  Maybe it was his way to show off his skill anyway!(#pin), but he did that through Amber.
  And David says - you are done in this counry, no company will ever hire you.
  
YEAH. Pin on all that, but makes sense now.

So!!
Kyle/Alice/Mike are screwed because their company and dream is fucked.
Max is screwed because his ~dream to work as a hacker for a huge high-tech company is fucked.
Amber is screwed because she is out of the job and carreer.

And the only thing that is left for them is to make it together on their own.

Is it from POV of all of them or mostly Max?
For now(#pin) - make it like HPMOR, like mostly Max, but sometimes can be others too.


SO!!!!
The next day/week.
Dumbass cookie project comes to an end, they're out of money, out of work, and out of the dream.
Dude won't throw away them from his house, probably, because he's a dude, but he's also out of money as well. For the same reason =)

So. They are screwed.
And this is where we begin. I'm happy to have the outline of how they met, but now what I'm interested in is the regular monster-of-the-week episode.

//also they can TOTALLY have collegehumor-like office scenes!! They do have dumb clients to work for, and their own stuff to do. Each of them is probably freelancing on their own as well.
Besides they totally hang out and everything.

So yeah. This has EVERYTHING.

Now. How do they get into hacking?
Well, they are screwed at everything, they have already done their first hack and it is clearly something they are at least sort of good at, and definitely capable of doing, and if not that dumb mistake they would win, and this time they will be careful, and also they don't have much to lose anyway!!

And.... where do they find their first job? Who proposes it? Max again?
He has that buddy who needs x, or knows a guy who needs y.

General computer crime....
Probably from a smaller company.
It is also more like a cartoonish/simplified world of incredibles/futurama.!!

BOOM. Excellent.
The question is only what do they steal and how.
And THAT I can totally take from HPMOR/Futurama/Firefly/etc/etc.
Or come up with.
Cmon!!

And another fun thing is that they are total newbies at hacking, worse than WW at the beginning.
These criminal guys pay very well. Sorta.

Does Max have contacts? Does he have friends who have contacts?

So! Alright.
Max has a friend, put a pin on that too. It works.

He hangs, contacts him, and that guy mentions that there's that job.

- Abandoned spaceship? > Abandoned company with loot.
- Train job? > Steal something physical in transit.
- Laser? > Pure break, enter, download data job.
- Niska? > get in trouble with criminals.
- Ariel? > 2 of them are downloading data as alarm goes off(no betrayal).
- Whorehouse? > protect a website from ddos or someting? Fight off another group of hackers.
- HPMOR battles? > Wining Defcon hacking competition!! (to get in the door somewhere, or fun)
- Wizengamot? > Defending net neutrality, making sure a bullshit law doesn't get approved.
- Saving Hermiony? > They freak out that Alice could be in danger, when they come to save her turns out that she kicked all the butts there were to be to kick.
- Inception? > Convince a guy to not sell his company or something, by helping/protecting/manipulating him. Maybe all 3.
- Prison Break? > Government agents are onto them.
- Pranks competition? > Competition between Max and Kyle, bet, who beats whom and such. Maybe breaking into 2 teams, 3 vs 3. on sometihng.
- Harry vs Tracey? > They all have decided to try LSD, when something comes up they need full alertness with.
- Harry vs peeves? > trolls come together on reddit to ddoss/attack them/their friends company or some website that they like? And they destroy trolls from the inside or some such.
- Agents? > They decide to infiltrate some company to find out the secrets, something super secret and exciting. Not as a job but because they need to know.
- Criminals take someone hostage?
- Woman, husband, the bank where he holds his money?
  
FUCK. YEAH.
Fuck yeah indeed =)


----


Okay. Important thing - not getting stuck.
Max has a friend with a job? Works. Put a pin on that, pivot later, now just move forward.

So. They are screwed, Max says I have an acquaitance.(friend? No, not friend, acquaitance. Something like that low-life criminal from firefly). He pays money... sort of...
On the upside - it shouldn't be too hard.

Great. It works. What needs to be done?
Steeling data.
What data could a criminal need to steal?
Well, maybe not low-life, maybe mafia or something.
Or even funnier - maybe Max thought these are just like some guys, and turns out it is some sort of terrifying organized crime-boss.
Which are probably also not what it seems.
Yeah, there may be something interesting there.
they first thought it's just some little guy needing to steal some competitors passwords and such.
Then they find out it's mafia - like what the hell would mafia need some little guy's passwords for?
And then as they retreive passwords(list of employees or such) they find something super weird, and turns out that little guys are not little guys at all, but instead a cover for something big and top-secret. And now there's no turning back.

Would be great to know what that is exactly.
- What do they need to steal?
- How do they get in contact?
- What it turns out to be?

What kind of innocuous thing could that be?
Like list of passwords? Employees?
Pretext-reality.
Like list of employees, which turns out to be a list of government agents?
(remember, cartoonish inception/futurama, can be very far and hilarious.)

What could mafia use for something evil, but not too horrible? But rather funny.
Like they thoiught these guys will maybe outcompete some small teacup comany, and they anded up doing something huge.

So.
- Max's friend. I have that guy who knows that guy, who has a hacking gig.
  Don't worry, it's nothing too big, and this time it won't be dangerous, we will be careful too.
- They have a meeting, turns out it's mafia. Uncertain but maybe pressured to take the gig, or convinced after doubts that it's not such a big deal.
- They work on it and get in, and see something strange/weird.
- They retreive and return the info.
  //mafia tries to kill them/get one over them? maybe they just have a video/proof for blackmail, not necessarily shooting and stuff. And they gets it back. Maybe in another episode.
- The next day they read in the news that they've unintentionally participated in something friggin huge. Turns out some crucial information from a giant com[any got leaked. And it is hilarious.
  
BOOM.
//And WHOAh. Wait, wha-at?? Was that above maybe an outlining process?? Or some glimpse of it at least.

Anyhow.

Great!!
- So what is it specifically that they are trying to retraive?
- And what does it turn out to be?
  
What can you possibly steal?
Passwords? Employee data? Some invention stuff?
> or you could put a virus INTO the network!!
That is by the way also very interesting, and seems easier too!! You just need to get in and make somebody to open a document/insert a memory card!! That seems even smaller/easier!!
And it is totally pure SE gig!!

And mafia could say thaat it is a little backdoor into their system.
But turns out it is....

well, the interesting thign is that it depends on what company that is!!
For example if it's a facebook that can be a personal data,
if google - that could be some secret algorithms,
 if dropbox - some corporate secrets. Of the whole friggin world.
if paypal - money.
if amazon - maybe like control of the drones or some such.
if android - well, tracking people and personal info and maybe viruses and such!!
if comcast - maybe destroy the internet in some particular area/building....
or, of course, bug some particular person.(like ghost in the wires. By the way, his books have infinity of ideas for me!! Cheating the casino and such!!).
>>>> a-a-a-and here comes my excuse to learn hacking =) By the way yeah, not now, but over time there could be more and more details about how exactly they are doing it. realistic details.
From Mitnick.

Besides, just like HPMOR, induces the desire to google. Good thing.

So.
//maybe some of them are in college too? Kyle, Amber, Alice, 

Why are gangsters chasing them?
Maybe after realizing what they had done they've decided not to give the info to them.
Where do they get money then? Did they have any avance? Will they have to return it?
What do they have on the gangsters?

Sounds of several gunshots echoed in the abandoned metro station.

A few bullets blasted the column right above the Max's shoulder as he dived into the space between trash containers to get away from the line of fire.

He estimated that they had about half a minute, so he got back to vigorously typing in his laptop. "Hey, that's what I call 'agile programming'!"

Kyle didn't appreciate the joke. He was hiding behind another column, watching 4 people in expensive suits and with guns in their hands running in their direction. "You've said it will be safe! You've sayed it will be just a simple job!"

"Well, the next time we will be more careful"

"The *next* time?! You gotta be high to think that I will agree to something like that again!"

Max just smiled. Typing has slowed down and then stopped with the victorious hit on enter key.

"Now we just give it a minute for it to work. Do you have any idea how do we last a minute without getting shot?"

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

*[2031-03-11 12:36]*

Tiny old house, one of the very few that still left in the center of a big city.
Group of 6 people gathered in the biggest room on the first floor.
All of them looked thoughtful and grim.

"So I take it we're completely screwed, huh?" abscentmindedly mumbled Alice(16 years old, long black hair, very lean) from the couch, without taking eyes off her tablet that was propped against her legs, where she was carefully drawing something. 

"Uh-huh" responded Mike(21 years old, buttoned-up t-shirt with a pocket protector. Seriously.) . He was sitting on the opposite end of the couch, and reading Feynman's lectures on physics(Volume 1) for a 4th time. He was always reading when he was fighting stress. Or not. He was always reading, really.

"How did we manage not to get this one? It was a website for a baking company for ktulhu's-sake!!" asked Amber(22 years old, bulky but comfortable cloth, shuffled red hair), although they all knew perfectly well how "I do not blame Kyle for not pushing on that one, of course" she was sitting on the floor tinkering with wires on the raspberry pi project that she was making. Very, very rarely there was a moment where you could see Amber without a cheerful simle on her face. That was one of thouse moments.

"I'm telling you, guys, I should've negotiated this project. You all are bored to death with this kind of work, and it shows, I don't really care, so I could've talked them into letting you do the job" Usually relaxed and careless Seth(28 years old, slightly overweight, very hairy and beardy) was playing xbox, but he kept losing the same simple level, his heart wasn't in it. The last part of the sentence rose to the intense scream, as a figure on the screen was firing hell on crowds of aliens.

"Yiii-ha!!" Max(22, black shuffled hair and short beard, black jeans and shirt with an orange tie, also in glasses - but regular ones, simple black narrow rectangles. Bright and intent brown eyes, with strikingly sharp and saturated, almost orange retinas) looked up from behind his thinkpad x4, happy smile dawning on his face.

"What?" Kyle(24, shaved head, goatee, long coat, piercing, intent, intelligent sight from behind his augmented reality glases) was standing in the center of the room, staring intently at Max.

"I've got an idea! I've got this friend who..."

"Uu-ugh..." - from every person in the room. Not again.

"No, hear me out!! This time it's legit... Almost. Well, at least less illegal. And *definitely* much less dangerous!" they've had this conversation before, but Max was certain that this time he will convince them. They didn't have much of a choice really. He was the only one really excited about a prospect of doing some hacking - he always found it invigorating - but he was pretty sure that all of them will really enjoy that too, eventually. Even though it really didn't seem possible right now.

"Alright, what do you have?" said Kyle, as everybody were staring at him.

Max's simle grew even wider. I knew this time it will work!! As cautious Kyle was, he was clealry more sick of the boring projects than any of them, and he may not like admitting it, but Max remembered very clearly how excited Kyle was on their last and only hack. Despite how that all turned out... Kyle may not think that hacking is very prudent, but this time he will take the interesting and challenging project he was craving for for so long.

"I have this... acquitance... who says he has a job for us. It won't be like the last time, I promise. It is a small company that doesn't take their security very seriously, and he says that all we need to do is steal some data from them for their competitors. Cmon, let's at least hear what do they have to offer!"

"Fine. Setup a meeting." Kyle's voice was still stern, but his face got noticeably less grim.


----

*[2031-03-14. 02:36AM]*

Man in the expensive black suit was standing in the middle of the old metro station, looking bemused. Two serious-looking guys in sunglasses(In the metro. At night.) were standing by his sides. "What did you choose this place for?" said the man, a little concerned. "Couldn't we met in starbucks or something?"

Kyle and Max looked at each other. From what Max knew about that kind of meetings from movies, he assumed that the old abandoned metro station was the way to go, besides he thought that this could impress 'an owner of a small company, a regular guy' his acquitance said they were supposed to meet. Now he himself was a little nervous, the guys that were standing in front of them were looking more like some low-level thugs. Thakfully, they were looking confused and unthreatening.

"This is more private" said Kyle, assuming the authoritative tone, Max firmly nodded.

"So" said Max, "what job do you have for us?"

"Recently we learned that our, uhm, competitors, got some data about out company. Private data abot our employees mostly, and also some financial and buisiness information that we would like to keep secret. What you will need to do is to find and destroy all the information they have on their servers about our company"

- Scene of Max proposing the hack
- Scene where Dean asks them to enter the competition
//Scene where they prepare for break in(to have a new scene to write)?
  
Six people gathered in a small studio aparment.

Beats:
we're screwed (-) > I have a solution + > I dislike the solution (-) > convinced +.
- Small apartment, 6 people in it.
- We're screwed. last project was horrible and even that failed.
- Kyle hates boring projects.
- Max - almost legal solution.
- Was sure Kyle will agree. Kyle agrees.
  
Tiny old house, one of the very few that still left in the center of a big city.
Or maybe it just appeared that way, compared to the giant, new, and shiny city.

Group of 6 people gathered in the biggest room on the first floor.
All of them looked thoughtful and grim.

"So I take it we're completely screwed, huh?" abscentmindedly mumbled Alice(16 years old, long black hair, very lean) from the couch, without taking eyes off her tablet that was propped against her legs, where she was carefully drawing something(the something depicted the previous clients, being screwed instead of them).

----

The study group gathered around the table.
Before anybody had time to say anything, the Dean suddenly appeared in the doorway.

"Oh, crap, I have just started hoping for a nice, normal day. I guess that doesn't happen in Greendale, does it?" thought Jeff out loud.

The Dean was wearing a fabulous light-blue dress, a wig of long light hair, and carrying 3 small stuffed dragons on his shoulders.
"Hello everyone!! I am the Deanarys Targaryen, the mother of dragons, and I am here to tell you that our school needs your help. Greendale is not the best school, but for generations we have been proud to hold the award for the best pacman score in the area, until City College took it from us 5 years ago. And now I am proud to say that we have an opportunity to get this honor back, return Greendale it's throne, so to speak." said he in a loud and cheerful voice while pointing at his dress.

Mike looked at the giant antient starship hanging above the canyon.
It was hanging there for generations, as long as anyone could remember.
Nobody have ever understood how did it work, nobody was even able to enter that thing.
Because they were living in the cavemen times.
And cavemen could never get into the spaceship.

-
It was a regular day for a Saul Goodman.
He helped one guy to get out of jail for dealing weed, and helped that creepy lady to get every penny her husband has ever owned or will ever own.

-
Meanwhile, Jane was sitting outside of the office, tweaking the latest security software that run their corporation, when she learned that her boss developed magical powers.
One of her laptops keeped the skype session with her boss opened, since she was trying to convince him not to open that kitten picture link in his email.
Apparently he forgot about that in the last 15 minutes, and now was abscentmidedly picking his nose while reading something on his computer.
She didn't tell him that she could see him immediately, and after awhilie it was just awkward,
 2Suddnly that picture grabbed her attention, as she saw something like a purple explosion from behind her bosses head. Boss clearly didn't notice any of that, as he was paying all his  attention to the computer screen. Jane just wanted to tell him something, as she noticed that a pen he held in his hand, again, unbeknown to him, disappeared in the burst of flames.
Boss kept reading something on his screen, laughin from time to time.

//some dummie gets magical powers, and a cool clever guy has to manipulate this idiot into doing what he wants. Cool. But dummie needs to also be cool and likeable. Maybe not stupid but just not the kind of character to use magical powers very well.

Harvey was sitting in his office when he didn't notice that something strange was happening in the city. He didn't notice because his office was on the 60th floor of a huge scyscraper.
This was a regular morning,

-
Ben and Sal stood back to back, shooting lasers at crowrs of robots that were trying to get through the doors of their building. Robots were humanoids, and looked a lot like scary sceletons. Sal wondered - why would you make a robot looking that weird? Granted, friendly-looking robots were looking even creepier, but then again - what is the point of designing a thing to look outright malicious? Almost like designers hoped that these robots will rebel. You could hardly see these things assembling cars or cleaning the streets or babysitting.

Loudest roar echoed through the entire forest, as a humongous foot landed in 2 meters from the Jessie. After a second of stunned silence, Greg grabbed him by hist shirt and started running in the opposite from the foot direction. They will take time to explain what is going on later, now it was clearly the time to run. They had no reasons to suspect that T-Rex would have any interest in them - after all, he would hopefully perfer a much bigger prey, but this pack of raptors on the other hand....

Frank was having his first date in a long long time. After 20 years of ruthlessly climbing the corporate ladder in the biggest and meanest software corporation of all time he almost forgot what's it like to talk to a person without a clear agenda or buttons to push.

She ran.

Zoe was on her 3rd course studying computational biology when these weird students started appearing more and more often on campus. It was hard to pinpoint what they all had in common, besides the strange behavior and aura of weirdness around them.

all had something strangely in common and alien....

## Example of writing a joke

First I need a topic, something that will create a default lane.

Default lane is usually a some situation in reality(I can take a dictionary and take a random word if I want to pick one), or if I'm writing fiction - some scene/situation in my "normal"(not funny) fictional reality.

Let's say the bare minimum that I need is "*Character(s) in a situation*".
<!-- Let's say I'm writing a story, and I have a scene that has students sitting on a boring lecture. -->

For example:
- Guy working out in the gym
- Students sitting on a boring lecture
- Guy sitting in front of the computer in his office
- One person pointing a gun at another person
- Dude waking up and drinking coffee
- Girl sitting on a couch doodling someting in a notebook
- 2 people on a raft in a middle of the ocean/dude on a tropical island
- Lawyer siting in his office/dude playing a guitar


"Guy working out in the gym".
This is our situation, through which brain naturally builds a default lane - images/predictoins/expectations associated with it.

Here's some elements of that lane:

- Environment. The place he is at. Objects surrounding him. Other characters there.
- THe reason he is there. Explanation why he is working out.
- Expectations. What will happen next, what will he do? 
- What kind of person he is? What does he think about it? His attitude/opinions?
- Interpretation - is that a gym? Is he working out? What do various elements mean?


Here's a few examples of jumps:

- Let's say it's not really a gym. What's the opposite of a gym? A bar.
- Maybe this gym is in the middle of antarctica
- Why is he there? Maybe he is hiding there from zombies.
- People usually lift weights around ~12 times - is it 120th time? The 2nd time?
- People work out to get stronger - does he work out because somebody told/forced him to?
- He will exercise some more and go home.  
  will he stay there all night(exaggeration)?
- Usually a certain sort of people attend gym. Who's the opposite of that?
  80 years old lady?
  Nerdy little guy?
  10 year old girl?


And here's some crazy alternatives/associations:

- People, working out - people are working out in jail
- People are lifting heavy things to move them from place to place
- Sport uniform can look silly/sexy.
  Who else exerts physical activity while dressing sexy? Strippers.
- Dumbbell weithgs are sort of round and flat. What else has that shape?
  Coins? Panakes? Frizby?
- Gym is a brigtly lit room with mirrors.... what else is like that....
  Balley class? Store where they sell cloth?

Great.

Now I need to connect the crazy lanes with the reality, explain them somehow.
Unlike with generating new ideas, I don't need to them completely compatible with reality,
any small and superficial explanation/association will do, just enough to write a setup.

So I am just going throug the crazy lanes one by one and trying to come up with explanations/connections.


---- 

- They are not really in the gym but in a bar?
  Guy intended to go to the bar but ended up in a gym? Opposite?
  Let's say a guy was inteding to go to a gym but ended up in a bar, because it's easier to connect/explain - he loves beer.
  
Now - writing a setup.
Need some phrase that is compatible with both of the lanes, phrase that suggests that he's working out in a gym, but is also compatible with him going to a bar.

"I went to a gym yesterday"?(but then went....)
"I was in the gym yesterday".
Yes, that works. He was in a gym, but he wasn't working out, he was drinking beer in the bar that's in that building.

Now - writing a joke. First expressing both lanes, then switching to a crazy/unexpected one.

> - Hey, dude, look at that belly, you need to go to a gym more often!
> - I /was/ at a gym yesterday, by the way.
> - I mean to work out, not to hang out in a local bar and drink beer!

----

Gym is in the middle of the antarctica.

Why is it there? Well, scientists there need to work out....

What other connection can there be? The whole gym was transported there?
Like with hurracane or something? Or was a dude on the ship that had a gym and then got off the course?

How can I suggest that he is in a normal gym, but then switch to the antarctica?

Need some other connection... gym... antarctica... air conditioner?
Penguins walk awrkwardly like people after the exercises?

> Guy comes back from the gym, barely walking.
> Hey, man, I love your penguin impression!

-----

Guy stays in the gym the whole night or 2 minutes.
//what will happen next.

Why? Overachiever?
High on too much coffee/doping/meth?

My character goes to the gym for the first time.
Somebody slipped him some doping/meth coctail.

Switch attention to some second storyline.

Get back to it at the end of the episode, in like a week.

Showing the dehydrated guy still there, working out.

----

He's hiding there from zombies.

Why?
That was the closest place to him?

Need a better association... gym... zombies... what's in common?

Zombies are dead, working out people are exhausted.
Zombies roar, working out people roar....
Zombies are pale, people in the gym can be covered with that white thingy...

> - I was at the gym the other day, I'm telling you, this guy is using too much /white thingy/. Imagine an exhausted, barely moving, pale roaring creatureb"
> - Eer, dude.... Are you sure that wasn't a zombie?

Maybe even retort with a joke, if i'll find some other connection between zombies and a guy.
For example if the 1st dude knows him:

> Well, he surea as hell is dead to me.

----


80 yo lady/a nerdy little guy/10yo girl going to the gym

Why is the old lady going to the gym? Because she's a champion wrestler.

Tiny grandma, slowly walks into the gym, comes to the giant weights.
"Hi, mister, can you help an old lady to hold the bar while I add some move weights?"
Guy looks at her skepically.
(need a stronger suggestion, the default explanation)

She takes them and lifts like it's nothing, with a manly mighty roar.

Nerdy guy? Computer games, achievements, level up?
//remember xkcd about connecting leveling up to working out?

10yo girl? Why?
Girl outperforming a big guy? Because she likes working out?
Your girlfriend wins tagged along with you to the gym and totally crushes you at every exercise?
Little girls cry, big guy cried out of exhaustion?
haha, I like it. Somewhat similar to some of the HIMYM jokes...

> Me and my daughter(no, my little son) went to the gym last week. God that was exhausting.
> [looking at the son] nah, looking at his friend: but only one of us cried like a little girl
> And I'm not too proud of it.


----

Guy goes to the gym because somebody told/forced him to.

Giant dude, done with his exercise, confidently throws away the weights, happy smile.
Tiny(imagine Lily from HIMYM), but bossy wife:
"Okay, not 2 more sets and then you're done"
His will breaks. Crying "but I don't wanna!! You are always making me do that! When can I stop?"
Wife gets angry:
"When I will have a strong and sexy husband. Now shut up and do pushups!"


----

Guy lifting weight 120th time.
Or 2nd time.

> Guy is extremely sweaty, roars as he lifts a dumbbell.
> We zoom out, he holds a bar with a tiny little weights.
> Bored trainer looks at him, and counts in a dull voice "two..."


> Guy is vigorously doing the pushups
No
> Skinny guy tired doing pushups with effort, somebody is counting - 5, 6
> Cut to the clock, 30 minutes passed.
> Even more tired guy, keeps doing the pushups. Long faces of shocked surrounded crowd, he keeps doing the pushups, 126th, 127th....

Especially if I setup beforehand that he is really determined, or does it to impress a girl or some such!

(remember Monsters Inc?)

----

People are lifting heavy things to move them from place to place

Already a good connection.  
Who moves heavy things from place to place? Let's say construction workers.

How do I create a setup compatible with both?
I can imagine describing men lifting weights and moving heavy objects, and then showing that they are construction workers, poor guys have to move around the whole gym from place to place.

"
I spent the whole day in a gym, lifting weights
It sucks being a contruction worker, and having to move the whole gym from one room to the next
"

____

Strippers are also doing physical activity and wearing small amount of weird cloth.

What kind of setup could describe both strippers and people going to the gym?

> My day was filled with sweaty bodies that had too little cloth on them
> Were you in a strip club?
> No, at the gym

That seems not too funny, gap is too small, and the suggestion is too weak. The first line is ambiguous and compatible with both of the lanes, I'm not making any strong assumptions.....

> I like going to this club, oh, thouse girls with their almost nakes bodies being in various attractive poses. Too bad all of them refused to give me a lap dance.
....
nah

> - I hate going to this club. All thouse ugly sweaty strippers, they aren't even that good. One of them even hit me when I asked her for a lap dance. 
> - Okay, I'll make sure to avoid that place. Where is that exactly?
> - [Gives him the address]
> - Dude, I've bin there, it's a gym!!

That's better. Although it's a bit harder to imagine a guy confusing gym with a strip club.
Gap is wider, suggestions are stronger, but connection is weaker.

---- 

People, working out - people are working out in jail

It is already a solid connection that makes sense.

How can I suggest that he is in the gym, but then switch that to the jail?

If I will show the jacked dude lifting weights and then say that it's a jail - might not be too surprising, the gap is small.

What if I will show a happy thin little guy, smilingly running on a treadmill, or better yet doing some gay warm up exercises. Or yoga!!

Lean skinny guy, happy smile, pink shirt, doing yoga in front of the weights.
We zoom out - and we see that he is in the jail, surrounded by grim and jacked criminals, waiting for their turn to use them.

Also, I can totally see how with certain background and explanations, I can cut to the next scene, where the jacked criminals are doing yoga with happy smiles and the (persuasive)skinny helping them out.

Note that you can do it backwards. You can show a group of untidy dressed criminal-looking dudes, lifting weights from a concrete floor, and then zoom out and show that they have occupied a corner of a very expensive gym, with businessmen and lawyers looking at them with concern.
Haha, maybe these dudes haven't even payed, it's just everyone is to scared of them to ask them to leave.

----
Dummbbell weights look like frizby.
- You throw frizby. - guy can throw a 20kg weight? Because he's so strong?

Image: Gym, extremely jucked guys. 2 of them are throwing a 20kg weights to each other like frizby.

----
- Gym is a brigtly lit room with mirrors.... what else is like that....
  Balley class? Store where they sell cloth?

Suggesting both:
Brigtly lit place, jacked guy standing in front of the mirror, in the lean underwear, playing with his muscles, dummbbell in one hand. Sweaty and exhausted. Presumably has been here for long.

Zoom out. Small sport-shop in the mall.
Concerned shopkeeper, little skinny guy/angry old lady:
"Sir, si-ir! If you won't gonna buy anything I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave!"

*** Scifi-HC. Setting/Character
Lily was visiting pyramids for the first time.

*** Story-HC. IInc. Problem. What can go wrong? (Obstacles<Antagonist?)
2 men in expensive suits seemed to appear out of nowhere.
"Please come with us" said one of them politely.
"Do I have to?"
"Yes, and don't be a problem. This place is surrounded"
"I will scream for help"
"Nobody here knows the language, nor really cares. You can try if you like"
"I will if you won't tell me immediately what's it all about."
"Look, don't play dumb. We have a hidden camera footage of you stealing some extremely classified information"
"Unless you will show me an arrest order and your documents I'm not going anywhere"
Agent sighed heavily and reached for his bag. At this moment Lily kicked the agent in the groin and bolted across the street, hoping to hide in the labyrinth of narrow streets of this crazy city. 2nd agents was 2 steps behind her.

***** Pyramides. 2 agents vs a girl [idea]

She killed an evil minister, now the whole world is hunting for her, especially evil agents.
She killed him because.... he was about to pass a law that will....lead to incredible trouble in the future? Screw her people? North Korean leader was about to launch a nuke? Guy had power to launch a nuke and wasn't stable? She knew him before and knows he's crazy?
Alliance.... why would Kaylee kill some government official? For hunting River?
Okay, screw that, she just stole something.
Something like.... Some artifact....
She stole a classified info(flash card with mcguffin) because she's a cool criminal.
Now agents are hunting her.
Cool, great IInc.
At climax she escapes.

*** Plot. Engage>Escalate>Lose. How does he go about achieving the goal?
Lily was sitting in the dark angar with her hands tied behind her back. Yeah, these people clearly weren't a government. With her eyes tied he could hear one man coming up to her.
"Okay, I'll get right to the point. You will tell us where you hid the flash card, and you will get out of here alive"

*** Climax. Creative Solution. How does he win final battle???
Plane was taking off the ground, as sounds of gunshots were getting quieter and quieter. She was never so happy about the fact that she learned how to fly. And to steal cars. And about the fact that stealing a plane wasn't that much harder.

"Benjamin Linus and Turtle fight robot rebellion.
Ben and Sal stood back to back, shooting lasers at crowrs of robots that were trying to get through the doors of their building. Robots were humanoids, and looked a lot like scary sceletons. Sal wondered - why would you make a robot looking that weird? Granted, friendly-looking robots were looking even creepier, but then again - what is the point of designing a thing to look outright malicious? Almost like designers hoped that these robots will rebel. You could hardly see these things assembling cars or cleaning the streets or babysitting.

escalate-lose - surrounded by robots?
turn into a win - infect the skynet?

and guess what - that should be already enough for a cartoonish climax with jokes!!!!

Jane manipulates her dummie scared boss into fighting and winning the necromancer

Harvey convinces dudes not to blow up the city?
Or escape.... when you see a clear problem it gives you most of the goal....

how can detroit escalate into something bad?

Yeah, see, these IIncs are cool challenges to solve, and climax is a solution.

Her name was Akira. She had short red hair, and freckles.
Being chief's daughter is pretty hard, her stern father was the complete opposite of the rebellious and freedom craving character of Akira.

Boredom. Boredom was always his main enemy.

"Good news everyone!" - well, that wasn't something you could hear too oftent. Although he could've just been referencing futurama, in which case they were as screwed as always.

"Our competitors are ..." - yep, definitely futurama.


Sun was setting beyound the horizon, white sand of the desert turned reddish in the sunset's light.
They've made a small camp rigt where they stood - there was no point in picking a place, it was the same sand in all directions.

Superheroe school was a giant shiny building standing on the shore of an ocean. Sun and mountains were refleting from it's windows. Steel and glass. It was the most modern and technologically advanced university you could imagine, built by an eccentrick billionaire who realized that it was time to train superheroes deliberately. They were hard to control but it was better than having uneducated and often miserable and rejected heroes running around and fighting each other without any understanding or means to do so well.

Dash was sitting on the social engineering lecture and looking concerned. Learning about this subject wass exciting but not at all what he expected a young superheroes should be taught. His father told him that superheroe should be 100% good, and show people an example, and be a great symbol of everything that is right and just. Dash saw the appeal in learning how to lie and plot, and he supposed it was necessary to learn to be able to fight supervillains who wouldn't hesitate to do so, but it still seemed weird. He used to imagine superheroes winning in battle, by their strength or speed, not in the intrigues or plotting.

Dark side of this creepy planet was called, and sometimes Kaylee thought that she saw the eyes gleaming in the light of the bright starts and 2 moons. Planet has slowed down it's rotation, and each cycle matched with the cycle of the planet rotating around a star. It seemed very improbablye, but out of the infinite number of starts in the universe each of which had several planets it was bound to happen at least once.
That weird coincidence resulted in one side of the planet being always turned towards the star, while the opposite side was constantly facing away, for thousands of years.
Local wildlife looked pretty brutal and it was.

It was hard to believe that some people were crazy enough to live here, but prescious minerals and unique lifeforms attracted 2 distinctly different kinds of people - thugs willing to do almost anything to satisfy their greed, and scientists willing to do almost anything to satisfy their curiosity.

None of the crew wanted to stay on this creepy planet any longer, but being chased by alliance left their ship broken, and this planet was the only place they could land in hopes of fixing it.
In the radio conversation local scientists explained to them where to land, but they couldn't come too close without disturbing the force fields, so they had to land in 50 meters from the entrance. That meant that they had to cross 50 meters filled vicious creatures of night.
Mal asked to send for some transport to fetch them, but it turned out that only recently a group of space pirates attacked their transport under a similar pretence, and held the drivers hostage until they were given some loot.

That meant that they were to cross these 50 meters relying only on their suits, speed and Jayne's favorite gun Vera. They were encouraged that most of the wildlife was chased away by light of projectors, but warned that they still should be extremely careful.

As Kaylee stept onto the ground(frozen to -120 degrees) she notices something creepy slythering away from under her feet. From the darkness surrounding a small spot of projector's light, she saw dozens of pairs of eyes gleaming in the darkness, reflecting their flashlights, and escaping being hit directly by any light beams.

> Prompt.

Cave's floor was wet and slippery. Various bugs were crawling arounds it's floor and walls.
Greg and Jessie were panting heavily, strenuously looking outside, trying to make out any movement or danger within the forest.

T-Rex was gone, and raptors seemed to follow the wrong lead.

They looked at each other, exhaling in unison. That was close.

"So, how the hell do you think we got here?" asked Jessie.

- Crazy experiment they did together?
- Accidentally, without knowing how that could happen
- ....
  
"Do you think that if I knew I would be here in the first place? What were you doing when you teleported here - you got here the same way, I'm assuming?" said Greg annoyed.

"Yo, man, I was just erhm... chilling with my homies, when this gigantic portal appeared. I couldn't resist checking it out, but once I came close it.. er... sucked me in? And then I'm standing in the middle of the forest looking at a giant lizard. The rest you know. What about you?"

"Same here. Except for homies, I was solving the case. Why the hell weren't you running back there by the way?"

"I was looking at a freaking Tyranosaur, man! I thought that I was.. imagining it. Hey, do you think it's just 2 of us or other people got here too?"

"That doesn't matter, and we'll find out eventually anyway. Now the best thing we can do is survie, explore this weird place, and then find a way to get the hell out of here."

Jessie looked around the cave, kicked around some dirt, accidntally killing several bugs.
"Alright, we need to find a better place to spend the night. I think I saw some more caves as we were running."

----

Night fell upon the forest. Dry and roomy cave was lighted by a small  fire burning in the center of it. Entrance to the cave had a few twists and turns, which prevented most of the mud from getting here, and was likely to prevent the light of the fire from attracting animals and mosquitos.

Jessie couldn't imagine how cold and terrifying it would have been here if not for the fire, for the first time in his life he was really glad that he smoked. At first he tried to pinch himself from time to time hoping that it was a weird dream or hallucination, but it was time to accept it - this was really happening. Exhausted, he leaned against the wall of the cave and passed out almost immediately.

----

He woke up with a jolt - he thought he heard somebody screaming. Woman's voice. His hopes of it being just a part of his uneasy dream were shaterred against the concerned look on the Gregs face, who also clearly has just waken up.

A lighthousestood tall, centuries of wind and rain and waves wore but haven't destroyed it's stone walls. Light was glowing at the top of it, as it had been for centuries.
Nobody stepped a food on the ground of the tiny island for centuries.
A boat has /?arrived? to the shore, and a man stepped off of it. Man wore black jeans and tshirt, a dslr photo camera hanging off his neck, black hair being shuffled by wind, rain hitting his glasses.
Wards guarding this lighthouse were antient and strong. This was the only portal guarding the entrance into atlantis.

Max had a beard Its either walter white or louis ck. My 2 heroes))

The Professor turned and looked down at him, dismissive as usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, magic? I thought you'd know better than to take this seriously son, even if you're only ten. Magis is just about the most unscientific thing there is!

Harry's mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry had been sent to the best primary schools -- and when that didn't work out, he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of starving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study whatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or sciecne competitions he entered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except, maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching biochemistry at Oxfort could hardly be expected to listen to the advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of course; that's what a Good Parent would do, and so, if you conceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But to take a ten-year-old *seriously?* Hardly.

Sometimes Harry wanted to secream at his father.

"Mum", Harry said. "If you want to win this argument with Dad, look in the chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. There's a quote there about how philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong, because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is observation -- that you just have to look at the world and report what you see. Um... off the top of my head I can't think of where to find something about how it's an ideal of science to settle things by experiment instead of arguments--"

His mother looked down at him and smiled. "Thank you, Harry. But--" her head rose back up to stare at her husband. "I don't want to win an argument with your father, I want my husband to, to listen to his wife who loves him, and trust her just this once--"

Harry closed his eyes briefly. *Hopeless.* Both of his parents were just hopeless.

Now his parents were getting into one of *those* arguments again. Where his mother tried to make his father feel guilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.

"I'm going to go to my room", Harry announced. His voice trembled a little. "Please try not to fight too much about this, Mum, Dad, we'll know soon enough how it comes out, right?"

"Of course, Harry", said his father, and his mother gave him a reassuring kiss, and they went on fighting while Harry climbed the stairs to his bedroom.

He shut the door behind him and tried to think.

The funny thing was, he *should* hae agreed with Dad. No one had ever seen any evidence of magic, and according to Mum, there was a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep something like that a secret? More magic? that seemed like a rather suspecious sort of excuse.

It should have been a clean case for mum joking, lying, or being insane, in the ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without a stamp. A little insanity was far, far less improbable than the universe really working like that.
