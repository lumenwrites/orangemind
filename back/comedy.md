# What is comedy.
Comedy happens when:
A person realizes that the default
*pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption* *(//he was not aware of?)*
he made was (very)wrong, and as a result he
- detects mistaken reasoning and quickly deletes of a false version/old-pattern
and that's when he laughs.


# Joke structure.




To achieve that effect, your goal is to:
- break/defeat/shatter the default 
- pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome

To do that you need to find an alternative
pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome
that is very different from the default one that a person has made,
but compatible with the information you have, makes sense in the hindsight.

Example:
Doctor's appointment.
- I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.
- But why?
- So I could examine you.

Default pattern: Doctor, patient, doctor gives him advice.
Alternative pattern: Dude jerks off in front of the doctor.
It is compatible with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.
Yet your
pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome
was (very wrong).

The main challenge in comedy is finding that (very-not-true)alternative.
That is both (very)different and 'wrong',
and at the same time
compatible, makes sense in the hindsight.

There are 2 main ways to do that. //3rd is misdirection.
- Look at all the elements/properties of the situation that you have
  (connectors) 
  (that may have double meaning, (very not true)alternative explanation/etc)
  and look for them  
- Come up with a crazy idea first, and then 'move', find a way to connect it
- //You can use misdirection
