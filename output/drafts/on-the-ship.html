          <h1 id="blogTitle"> On the ship </h1>
          <hr />	  
	  <p>The ship was kneeling left and right as the giant waves were hitting it's sides.</p>
<p>Pirate Cornelius was in a bad mood, and that had nothing to do with the storm. He was used to dealing with storms. What he was not used to dealing with was….</p>
<p>“But according to even the briefest calculations using Bayesian probability, considering the priors available to me, the chances of that happening are infitesimally small!!” said the thin figure in the black pants and t-shirt.</p>
<p>Cornelius looked at his crew. "Alright, which one of you idiots is responsible for taking <em>that</em>" the gesture to the figure “on our ship!? And why is he not feeding the sharks since 3 hours ago?” </p>
<p>“Well, boss, I'm sorry boss, but you've told us to bring a hostage! You've said that it should be someone from the rich family, but this one even better!! This is a magician!!” said Boram-the-giant, a huge muscular man, a great warrior but not a very sharp guy. He was bigger and stronger than Cornelius, but still very afraid of him - he saw what Cornelius did with many others who were bigger and stronger, yet not careful enough around him. Boram had every intention of staying on the captain's advisor good side.</p>
<p>“MAGICIAN?? What have you done you fools!! What will we do with the magician?!”</p>
<p>“I've heard they are rich, and have all kinds of artifacts…”</p>
<p>“The point of taking a hostage was to trade him for money or immunity from federation's ships!! What do you think magicians will do when they find out we have one of their own? Give us money? Ha!! They can teleport into this ship or fly here on dragons or send ghosts on our heads!!”</p>
<p>The look of shock and horror was dawning on the faces of everyone who heard that.</p>
<p>“Oh no.... But… but.. But what if we throw him overboard now, and nobody will have to know?”</p>
<p>“Yeah? Have you thought about what this one mage can do to us? I saw spells that burned and sank the whole fleets! And what makes you think that magicians don't know that we took him already? They have ways of knowing about each other." said the old one-legged pirate.</p>
<p>“Yeah, for all we know he is just toying with us, waiting for a pleasant moment to burn this ship or turn us into his fateful zombies or worse….” said skinny-Rick. He was not normally a fearful guy, but right now he wished he was very very far away from this ship, he also heard the tales of what magicians could do when they're angry.</p>
<p>“But this is just a kid.” protested Boram.</p>
<p>“He. Is. A. MAGICIAN!!” yelled Cornelius. “What part of the word ‘magician’ don't you understand? They can cause tornadoes infested by flaming sharks <em>by accident</em>!!”</p>
<hr />
<p>Eric's head was spinning. Part of him was still hoping that this was an acid flashback, but the rest of him knew that it wasn't.
Just yesterday he was at his university, attending lectures, hanging with friends, working as a junior software developer in a cool startup, and today….. today was this.</p>
<p>The last normal thing he remembered was waiting for a cab in Palo Alto to take him to Stanford, when he thought that he saw a glimpse of a weird hooded figure(?). And the next moment, in a brief purple flash, he was standing under the rain, in the middle what seemed like an old town, illuminated only by a full bright moon peering from behind the clouds, and by fire, that was coming from a few burning buildings around him.</p>
<p>He remembered seeing 3 men with knives and old(?) guns running towards him. And after what seemed like a few minutes of chaos and running and chaos, he regained his consciousness on a wet wooden floor of a cabin. It was immediately obvious that he was on a ship, with all the /?ship equipment? laying around him and hanging off the walls.</p>
<p>As he was peeking through the door(which was unlocked), it suddenly jerked open, and the next moment he was dragged outside, and surrounded by a group of terrifyingly looking men, several of them holding their torches.</p>
<p>One of them yelled something, and the group of men took a step back, suddenly looking scared and uncertain.</p>
<p>“Okay, what's going on here?” Eric demanded an explanation. He wasn't usually careless or acting cocky in the uncertain and clearly dangerous situation, but the mixture of confusion and the seeming unreality of what was going on made him determined to find out what the hell any of that meant, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>None of the pirates - of course, these were pirates, stereotypical pirates that could as well have came out of a cartoon - seemed eager to answer his question.
“Where am I?”</p>
<p>“Ehm…. You're on a ship...” said one of the men uncertainly.</p>
<p>”But according to even the briefest calculations using Bayesian probability, considering the priors available to me, the chances of that happening are infitesimally small!!” Eric felt that he was starting to panic, his attempts to explain how he could get out of the sunny California into the pirate ship in the middle of the night were crashing against the utter impossibility of that happening. Seeing that he was surrounded by a sea in every direction he could look wasn't helping.</p>
