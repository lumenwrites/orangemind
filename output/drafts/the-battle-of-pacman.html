          <h1 id="blogTitle"> The Battle of Pacman </h1>
          <hr />
	  <p>The study group seated comfortably around the table.
Before anybody had time to say anything, the Dean suddenly appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Oh, crap, I have just started hoping for a nice, normal day. I guess that doesn't happen in the Greendale, does it?" thought Jeff out loud.</p>
<p>The Dean was wearing a fabulous light-blue dress, a wig of long light hair, and carrying 3 small stuffed dragons on his shoulders. "Hello everyone!! I am Deanarys Targaryen, the mother of dragons, and I am here to tell you that our school needs your help. Greendale is not the best school, but for generations we have been proud to hold the award for the best pacman score in the area, until City College took it from us 5 years ago. And now I am proud to say that we have an opportunity to get this honor back, return Greendale it's throne, so to speak." said he in a loud and cheerful voice while pointing at his dress.</p>


<p>“Oh, cmon, guys, please! You are our only chance! Greendale never had a team of heroes to be able to defeat the City College Dynasty of pacman players!! We are hosting the tournament this year, it will be too embarrassing to lose again!” said Dean in response to the disbelieving  stares.</p>
<p>“Okay, I will kick their butts if it's so important to you. You may not know that, but in school I've always been something of a pacman prodigy.” said Troy with a cocky smile.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at him in the stunned silence.</p>
<hr />
<p>First day of the tournament started the next week, and it was not looking well for Greendale.
It all started when the City College team entered the campus.
Like superheroes ninja assassins their players envaded.
Walking in a weirdly discreet way, turning only in the right angles, never crossing anything diagonally, City College Dynasty of pacman players strode through the Greendale grounds.</p>
<p>There were legends that since their first steps these people were learning to walk only in straight lines, along the threads that were suspending small M&amp;M's up in the air.</p>
<p>One of them carrying a flag with a sigyl each of the team members had on their cloth - pacman chasing the ghost.</p>
<p>Some of them were singing something that seemed like a gymn, played with an 8-bit melody, it's words were hard to distinguish, except for the /?repeated lines? that went “waka-waka”.</p>
<p>Troy, looking shocked, turned around and stumbled away, mumbling something about “needing to practice more”.</p>
<hr />
<p>Troy was practicing energetically the whole time since he saw what he was up against.
He wasn't sure why he was so invested in the game(#q), but he knew that he had to win.</p>
<p>Powerbars and soda cans were lying all around him in the apartment.</p>
<p>Abed was glancing at him with a slightly worried looks from time to time. Troy should've taken it as a danger sign that this time it was <em>Abed</em> who was worried about <em>his</em>  behavior, but Troy didn't notice. He had pellets to collect and ghosts to eat.</p>
<p>In a few minutes of intense gaming the controller fell to the floor as Troy's /?sat back? on the couch, his fierce glare turning into a grimmace of exasperation.</p>
<p>“You don't look upset. What's going on?” asked Abed with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.</p>
<p>“Last year's record was 827!! 827, Abed!! My best score is 563!!”</p>
<p>Abed smiled slyly “I know what you need. You need a pac-sei.”</p>
<p>“A pac-what?…”</p>
<hr />
<p>As Troy was spending all his time on practice, everyone else were getting busy meeting the City College team - to look for their weaknesses, of course.</p>
<p>Well, everyone except for Jeff.
“Oh, cmon Jeff!! You have to help us to help Troy!! We have no chance without your help! It is important!” said Pierce persuasively.</p>
<p>“No I don't, yes you do, and no it's not. And why do you care?” replied Jeff without looking up from his phone.</p>
<p>(#q)“Well, I may or may not have bet a /?considerable amount of money? on Troy winning this game”.</p>
<p>“Why would you do that?”</p>
<p>“Well, that happened before I saw the city college team, and I wanted to support Troy in his endeavor, because we are bros and that's what bros do ” //Pierce is overly enthusiastic about being bros with Troy in this episode?</p>
<hr />
<p>The heavy smoke rushed away from the door as the two figures, visible only as dark silhouettes in the bright light of a doorway, entered the small and dimly lit room. Quiet sound of gong signified the presence of visitors.</p>
<p>From behind the black-blue-yellow curtains, decorated with labyrinths and pellets and ghosts, came out the pac-master.</p>
<p>As he looked at the guests, his sight stopped on Troy.
“Hel-” began Troy.</p>
<p>“I knew this day day would come!” said the Master, with excitement in his voice. </p>
<p>"Wha…"</p>
<p>“You are the one! The chosen one, the only one capanle to defeat the dark warriors of the pac-Dynasty!!”</p>
<p>Troy suspected that there was something more than tobacco in the pac-master's pipe, but said nothing.</p>
<p>“Hello, ehm, pac-master. I am here to learn from you the ancient art of…. beating the pacman game with the highest score or something… ”</p>
<p>“I know” said the Master, looking all incredibly wise and experienced. “Come with me.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Ancient computer stood in the clouded room.
Figures off ghosts and pellets were spread across the small space.</p>
<p>Troy was dodging the stick with the ghosts at the end of it, pac-master was trying to reach him with.</p>
<p>“Is this really necessary? I thought I was going to learn tp play the game!”</p>
<p>“To play pacman” (in a heavy accent) “you must learn to think like pacman, you must BE pacman!!”</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile in Greendale Ben Chang was unrolling the red tape. The whole campus was /?inwebd? by it, as no straight 90 degree angle left in the entire college grounds.</p>
<p>Students were navigated the labyrinth of the tapes looking annoyed and confused, but not anywhere near as much as the /?opponents? have been. This was war, and Chang had only one weapon - of a psychological kind.</p>
<p>From time to time you could see ghosts images and people in ghost costumes jumping from behind the corners inside buildings, /?breeding? panic among the City College students. 
Their team was looking distressed but determined.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the day of the last battle everything was quiet in the Greendale.</p>
<p>At the center of the computer class there was a brightly lit /?boxing podium? with 2 computers old standing in the center of it.</p>
<p>Excited crowd gathered around the scene, and at the sound of gong, 2 players entered the scene.</p>
<p>Figure in the black /?battle dress? with a yellow belt was the /?Chinese? player, the last survivor of the ruthless tournament.</p>
<p>The figure in the black robes threw back it's /?head thingy? revealing the determined face of Troy barns.</p>
<p>“And so we met again" said he ominously.
The opponent replied with a sharp nod.
Well, let's get to it then.</p>
<p>And so the battle has began.</p>
<p>Keyboard keys were pressed.</p>
<p>Pellets were eaten.</p>
<p>Ghosts were destroyed.</p>
<p>In the last seconds of the battle, Troy remembered in a flashback and applied the secret trick his teacher has taught him, thus defeating his opponent, and getting the glorious prize of a pacman-cup back to the Greendale.</p>
