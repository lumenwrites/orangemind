          <h1 id="blogTitle"> The first battle </h1>
          <hr />
	  <p>Dash felt like he was going to pass out of exhaustion.
The battle was at it's hardest, and they were losing.
Vi was protecting him and Kyle with her force field while Kyle was struggling to keep his portal open while Dash was attempting to throw sleeping bombs at their enemies.</p>
<p>The team they were fighting against included very powerful supers. One could control the metal, another, Pyro, could manipulate the fire, and finally, they had a telepath and seer. A seer!! How are you supposed to fight against someone who can literally see the future, even if for 8.5 seconds?</p>
<p>That meant that whenever Dash was going to attack - seer would simply send a telepathic command to magnetto, and Dash would face a metal wall on his way, while having to dodge the streams of fire from Pyro.</p>
<p>Their only hope was to disable or confuse the seer.
And their only advantage was that dash was faster.</p>
<p>The goal is not to choose a path that leads to victory, but to make sure that all the paths lead to victory - he remembered someone's quote.</p>
<p>"Vi!" said Dash, "Create the force field around the seer!"</p>
<p>Kyle's portals could not penetrate Vi's shield, there was a chance that seer's powers will not be able to do that either.</p>
<p>Field around them disappeared, immediately reappearing around the seer.</p>
<p>"Yes!!" Apparently that was an attack that seer had no way of avoiding.</p>
<p>Now it was up to Dash and Kyle to disable the last 2 opponents, which suddenly became a lot more doable.</p>
<p>The next second, right before the huge stream of fire was about to hit them, Kyle opened a portal, which consumed the fire and spat it out in the direction of magneto, who this time was unable to dodge it.</p>
<p>Then the time slowed down and things seemed to become share but more colorless, as Dash used the last burst of his power to run towards Pyro and shoot a stream of stunning rays at her.</p>
<p>And then everything got quiet.</p>
<p>Pyro was peacefully sleeping in the middle of the battlefield, seer was trapped in the force field, and magnet to was probably teleported into informatory by now.</p>
<p>"We won!!" yelled Dash, as the simulated environment around them faded, slowly turning into the inwards of a sleeping capsule they used to simulate their training battles.</p>
