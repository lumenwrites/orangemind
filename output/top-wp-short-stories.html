<p>Living life as a turtle meant I could live a long time. I'd have plenty of time to accomplish all of my goals. Throughout my life I had gathered riches, built castles, and attained more power than any other turtle before me. That was all great, but what I wanted more than anything was a wife; someone to spend time with and care about. </p>
<p>It was over twenty years ago when I found the woman of my dreams. However, she never loved me back. I tried desperately for years to get her to enjoy her time with me. I took her on all sorts of special dates-  underwater, in space, in one of my many homes. </p>
<p>But every time I've tried to take her out, some god awful plumber shows up, occasionally bringing his good-for-nothing friends, and spoils my time. I haven't quite figured him out after all this time, but I think he's jealous of me. </p>
<p>For example, last week I took the girl of my dreams for a go-kart ride up to my castle since she loves the view up there. Next thing I knew, the plumber found me and was trying to smash my head in with his feet! He stole my woman from me, and left me to die. My shell was cracked, my love was taken away again, and the man with the mustache smiled.</p>

<p>Pretty quickly people started to figure out that when someone else died, everyone with a lower number moved up.  There wasn’t really much that this meant for the higher numbers, but for the lower numbers it was a bloodbath.  The higher numbers started by trying to kill the numbers above themselves, but there was a reason for the rankings.  5 fell to 3.  3 fell to 2.  Only number 17 managed to kill number 16, and even then it was with 18’s help.  He still wound up hooked to a machine for the short time he managed to live.  </p>
<p>Eventually they realized the better plan was to start killing the numbers lower than you.  2 killed 3-15, then 16 moves up, turns to 3.  That 3 kills 4-73, 74 moves up and becomes 4.  That 4 kills… and on and on.  It led to huge gaps in power between the top ten.  For all that time, nobody set their sights on me.  I’m number one.  Of course I am the strongest.  Far and away.  What can I do?  Only a handful of people ever knew, and that’s all they are now, a handful.  At least that’s what I tell people.  Reality is always such a letdown.   </p>

<p>Tickets HB-10078 (Biting your own cheek), HB-10084 (Suicide?), HB-10092 (immune system causes societally disfiguring facial pocs) and HB-10111 (Menstrual Shedding?!!) have been marked as "unable to reproduce".</p>
<p>Major items for next release include bugfixes of more unintended flora. Major structural complaints are a platform fault, and God has no intention of working further on these. God reminds you who exactly is the omnipotent, omniscient creator being, and thus, who likely has the better view of things.</p>

<p>I revved the powerful engine of my Mercedes and looked at the sucker next to me in his Abercrombie flannel shirt and ridiculous cowboy hat. His Mustang growled to life in response, and he threw me a challenging stare. I reached into my Levis and pulled out my trusty Ray-Bans. "Oh, it's on like Donkey Kong ^tm," I responded. He popped a stick of Wrigley's gum and called out "Just Do It!"</p>
<p>The light flipped to green and the engines roared like ferocious beasts straight out Jurassic World. We tore down the streets, weaving recklessly through traffic; one of Home Depot's many convenient locations whizzed by in an orange blur. My trusty Goodyear tires gripped the pavement as if hanging on for dear life. I floored it, kicking up a cloud of dust like a Looney Toons character. Pedestrians scrambled for cover behind an AT&amp;T phone booth; hopefully they had remembered to wear their Reeboks! My heart was pumping as I wove through traffic: "I'm lovin' it!" I yelled out to no one in particular. </p>
<p>I couldn't keep going like this forever; I'm not the Energizer Bunny. Ahead of me, a BP tanker truck turned suddenly in front of me. Everything seemed to be going in slow motion, like one of those great AllState commercials. Shards of glass cast showers of light like a Zales diamond. Luckily, my Mercedes has best-in-class safety features: the airbags deployed, and my can of Coke didn't even spill in the cup holder.</p>
<p>I watched in frustration as my opponent cruised by and swung into McDonalds for a victory McFlurry. He tipped his Stetson brim at me as he passed in a "nice try" gesture. Maybe next time. </p>

<p>"MY FAMILY WILL STARVE CAUSE HE WAS AN ASS IN LIFE AND AN ASS IN DEATH! Can't we arrange something...anything?" </p>
<p>The lawyer frowned, with a hint of pity and pride "I'm sorry. I understand you are a grieving widow, but I must follow with his wishes."</p>
<p>She stormed out in tears. The lawyer sat in an empty room, and walked over to the bookcase where the book she wanted rested on an old shelf. A roach was sitting in front of it, rubbing its antennae all over the cover, as if it was trying to say something.</p>
<p>He squashed it, washed his hands, and thought nothing more of it. </p>

<p>"Now take your money, go to the adult store, and buy yourself a real toy just like God intended, and LEAVE US OUT OF YOU."</p>

<p>Derek smiled down at his daughter. The book he spent the past thirty minutes reading to her was now closed, sitting on the desk next to her bed. A small nightlight was plugged into the wall because she was afraid of the dark. It was in the shape of her favorite animal, an elephant. She was clutching a stuffed one to her chest, head buried in the toy. Gently rubbing her head so as not to wake her, he leaned down and kissed her forehead. </p>
<p>He turned the light off as he left the room. </p>

<p>Derek looked down at his daughter. His face was hard and cold, and he looked grey and gaunt from lack of sleep. The sun was setting and it was slowly becoming darker as night approached. She was clutching her stuffed elephant to her chest, fingers wrapped as tight as they could be around the toy. His throat was tight. Rubbing her head because he knew it wouldn't wake her, he leaned down and kissed her forehead. </p>
<p>He stepped back and let them lower her into the ground.</p>

<p>I knew something was up when granddad stopped taking his meds. It was unlike him to go against a doctors orders, plus - the medication really seemed to be helping him regain his previous mental faculties. </p>
<p>No longer would he start one sentence and then finish with another, forgetting why he started in the first place. He was more focused and coherent than he'd ever been, better even.</p>
<p>"Grandad I don't understand why -" I began, but he held up a hand to silence me, and took a seat in the armchair next to the sofa where Beth and I were sitting.</p>
<p>"What's the latest on tadpole?" he asked, nodding at large bump in her belly.</p>
<p>The pregnancy was something of a sour topic. The first five months had been problem free, but then a routine test had shown a complication that started off as a minor blip on a chart, and then escalated into several minor blips on several other charts, none of which we understood.</p>
<p>"Outlook so-so" I said, trying to sound more cheerful than I was, and not pulling it off at all.</p>
<p>"I see" he said, his eyes transfixed with his hand hovering over her belly like it was warming him up. He always said he felt a special connection to our child, which was odd because he already had two grandkids and it was unlike him to play favorites.</p>
<p>"I saw your medication in the fridge granddad. You haven't taken anything in three days."</p>
<p>He didn't say anything, just nodded and kept his hand by Beth's belly. </p>

<p>Emile froze. There was a hardness in this man’s voice that let Emile know that he wasn’t messing around. His speech gritted on Emile’s ears like sandpaper. </p>
<hr />
<p>“Hands over your head. Get on the ground.” The command came suddenly, forcefully. Emile hadn’t expected this. He was just trying to get home. Why now, why him? He looked around, hoping to find some way out of this situation. “I’m not going to ask again.” </p>
<hr />
<p>‘This is my chance to run,’ thought Emile. If he could make it fifteen feet, he would be around that corner and back out on the street. People would be able to see him there. “Don’t even think about it,” said the man, following Emile’s gaze. </p>
<hr />
<p>A sharp clap suddenly resounded down the alleyway. “That was a warning,” said the man holding the gun. The man took a moment to let the smoke clear as he lazily chambered another round. </p>
<hr />
<p>Emile looked up at the man. Shadows masked most of his figure, but Emile could piece together something about him from the disjointed shadows and features. This was not this man’s first time doing this, that much was clear. He was too cool, too confident. His hand was steady as it held the small revolver. “Today’s just not your day, kid,” the man said. </p>
