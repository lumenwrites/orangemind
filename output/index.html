	    <p>Imagine I offer you a gamble. I will spin the wheel that looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/expected-value-1.png" /></p>
<p>And you win the amount of money that it will choose. If it hits a negative number you owe me that much. Should you play or not?</p>
<p>This is the kind of problem you are solving every time you are trying to decide whether or not to take any risky action.</p>
<p>It comes down to figuring out whether the action has a positive or negative value to you, so called Expected Utility, whether it’s benefits outweigh the potential risks.</p>
<p>To find out the answer, you need to know the sum of all the potential benefits multiplied by their probability, and compare it to the benefits and probability of the risks.</p>
<p>So first ...</p>

	    <p>You see this beautiful girl standing across the room. You would like to approach her and start a conversation, but then you think to yourself “Nah, she probably has a boyfriend. Also she wouldn’t like me anyway. Not to mention that I need to focus on studying, I don’t really have time for relationships.” So you look away, go home, play World of Warcraft, eat a pizza, feed your cats, hump your human-sized action figure of Chewbacca, go to sleep, and die alone.</p>
<p>Were your excuses the actual reasons for not approaching? Imagine if you’d know with 100% certainty that you will not get rejected, would you still decide that you’d rather focus on studying?</p>
<p>Rationalization means coming up with seemingly logical/rational explanations ...</p>

<p>That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A scientist approached a group of people who were trying to decide between the job offers. He asked them to make a guess about which job they will probably choose, and estimate how confident they are. On average, they said they were only 66% confident in their first choice, but in reality only 1 out of 24 people ended up changing their mind and choosing a different option.</p>
<p>Once you can guess what your answer will be — you have probably already decided. And most of the time people can guess their answer within half a second of hearing the question. This half a second is often all the time we give ourselves to think, after that we have ...</p>

	  <p>
	    <p>Let’s say you’ve been planning to go see a movie this Friday, and have already bought a ticket, but now that it’s time to go out you realize that you don’t want to go, and that you would rather enjoy spending your evening at home. Should you go or not?</p>
<p>Most of the people say yes, after all, the ticket has already been paid for, and it’s nonrefundable, so you wouldn’t want it to be wasted, right?</p>
<p>That is called a Sunk Cost Fallacy — the ​idea that people tend to stick with the courses of action they have ​invested ​money, ​time, or ​effort in, ​even when continuing is not the best thing to do.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it’s irrational ...</p>

	    <p>Let’s say your elbow is itchy, and you are starting to fear that it might be serious. You type in google “itchy elbow, serious symptom”, and in 20 minutes you are convinced that you have elbow cancer, space AIDS, and a severe case of acute ladidadidosis. The more you search, the more certain you are of your impending doom.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, you may type “dolphins are racist”, and find out all about dolphins being the secret force behind holocaust.</p>
<p>You can easily find a confirmation for any belief, and people often do.</p>
<p>We tend to look for information that confirms our beliefs. We jump to conclusions, assume that our initial guess is correct, and then look for evidence that supports it. That is called confirmation ...</p>

	  <p>
	    <p>Imagine you have a basket of fruits(apples and oranges), you reach out, take one at random, and eat it. Then you decide you’re hungry, and eat a few more. At that point you realize that you ate like 5 apples and only one orange, so you think that there’s way more apples in there. Makes sense.</p>
<p>Now you reach into a different basket, and grab a bunch of berries —5 strawberries and 10 blueberries. Should you think that there’s 2 times more blueberries here? Not really, because strawberries are bigger and heavier, so there’s more of them at the bottom of the basket than at the top, and your estimate would be biased.</p>
<p>This is called statistical bias. When your information is skewed ...</p>

no term for fairness in the equations of motion.<br />
The universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care.<br />
The stars don’t care, or the Sun, or the sky.<br />
But they don’t have to!<br />
<em>We</em> care! There <em>is</em> light in this world, and it's us!</p>

Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.<br />
