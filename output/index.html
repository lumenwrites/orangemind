<p>False Dichotomy means taking a complex issue, and boiling it down to 2 simple mutually exclusive choices, when in reality there’s more alternatives available. To make their side look more appealing, people present nuanced arguments as black and white, or take extremes and pretend like they are the only options.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking often leads to ignoring potential solutions, and prevents us from gaining an accurate understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>It also leads to polarization of opinions — people treat an argument as a battle against the opposite side, and as a result take more and more extreme positions. Sometimes people are afraid to offer measured opinions because their own side will call them a traitor.</p>
<p>For example a politician may demonize drugs and suggest longer sentences for drug addicts, because taking a more balanced view will make him look like he supports drugs.</p>
<p>Some other examples of this fallacy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Either you are with us or against us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either we improve this law or everyone will suffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either you go to church or you are a bad person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either you are a republican or a democrat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To overcome it, remember that in reality things are rarely one-sided. Most of the time complex issues have costs and benefits. Optimizing for values often requires trade offs. To get the most accurate picture, you want to see flaws and advantages of both positions.</p>
<p>Just because you support one side of the with one group of people, doesn’t mean you have to automatically agree with everything that side says and reject the opposite side.</p>

<h2>Tips on achieving the flow</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29">Flow</a> is an amazing state that you enter when you’re completely immersed into some activity. It is a state of high consciousness and full engagement. It is the reason people are doing complicated and creative things like art and science.</p>
<p>Flow is one of the best experiences in life. This is what makes you passionate about what you do, you get the core happiness in your life out of doing the thing you love. It gives you full immersion, extreme productivity, nonstop energy.</p>
<p>When you’re in the flow you’re completely focused, present, on top of your performance. You’re working at the edge of your abilities, all of your faculties are focused on one activity, your sense of time and of self dissolves, because your brain has no resources left to sustain it.</p>
<p>As a result you are extremely driven, and you get good at what you do fast just by naturally doing what you love.</p>
<p>So how do you achieve it? Here are the elements you need to make it work well:</p>
<h3>Set clear and valuable goals</h3>
<p>The first thing that you need is a simple, unambiguous goal that you value and know how to achieve, a challenge that you know how to solve.</p>
<p>If what you want to do is a big and complicated task — break it down into multiple smaller ones, then breakdown the first of them into several parts again, and that until you have an easy first step that takes 20 minutes or less to accomplish. By the way this goal setting, breaking down, and planning often IS the first easy step to focus on.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*rQBmbr9dfft3IE_0.png" /></p>
<p>Also notice that the goal should be at the right level for you, it should be simple enough for you to feel confident and competent, yet challenging enough to be interesting. Ideally, your task should be a <em>little</em> bit more challenging than you’re used to.</p>
<p>And make sure that what you do really matters to you. Your brain won’t engage into taking steps towards goals you don’t care about, so make it clear how valuable goals you are, and how the steps you’re taking bring you closer to them.</p>
<h3>Take your time. Don’t resist being out of state. Build momentum.</h3>
<p>In a sense, getting into flow is like falling asleep — it takes time, it is a result of particular actions, but you can not force yourself into it.</p>
<p>You’re not a computer, and you most likely won’t enter the state in the first 30 seconds. Usually it takes around 20 minutes, sometimes less(if task is very clear, interesting and engaging). Sometimes it can take longer, and you need to realize — it is perfectly normal.</p>
<p>Being lazy and uninterested(‘out of state’) at the beginning is perfectly fine, nobody can switch into a focused mode in seconds. Just trust the process and keep going through the right steps.</p>
<p>You can set up a timer(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro technique</a> can be very helpful) for 20–30 minutes, and decide to completely focus on the task for this time.</p>
<h3>Focus and Presence.</h3>
<p>Plug off. Remove distractions, both external and internal.</p>
<p>When you start, your mind usually tends to wander away and get distracted from the task. Realize that it’s normal, don’t beat yourself up, just gently get your attention back to the question you’re thinking about.</p>
<p>This kind of focus is similar to meditation, by learning to meditate you learn to you “turn off” all of the unrelated thoughts, and get into the present moment, focus on the process.</p>
<p>Also — think ‘inside’ the process, don’t be ‘meta’. If you’re writing — write, if you’re painting — paint. Don’t get distracted on organizing your workspace or trying to figure out the best tools and techniques to do it. It feels productive, but it often isn’t. Don’t confuse being focused on the process itself with being focused on figuring out how it’s done.</p>
<h3>Intent + freedom from outcome</h3>
<p>In creative work, you often can not control the outcome of what you’re doing. When you’re just learning to write, code, or paint, you can not directly control how good the end result will be.</p>
<p>That is why it’s best not to worry about the final outcome, and focus on taking the right steps, optimizing your process, learning your skills, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_%28learning_method%29">deliberate practice</a>. These are the things you can directly control.</p>
<p>Measure the results you can directly control, and gain satisfaction and rewards from that. Outcome that you get is a side effect of your actions, and you can not directly control it. Judge how well you’re doing based on your actions, not the results.</p>
<h3>Manage your expectations to make your emotional state go up.</h3>
<p>Enjoy every little step forward that you take.</p>
<p>It is important for taking steps forward be fulfilling and satisfying for you, that keeps you motivated and enjoying the process.</p>
<p>You want to feel happy and excited after accomplishing every task, instead of just getting tired and exhausted.</p>
<p>Manage your expectations. Learn to enjoy taking steps forward, don’t beat yourself up, instead — pat yourself on the back for every bit of progress. That makes you more engaged and keeps you loving the process and wanting to do it more.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about how fast you are going, or how well you’re doing. Just taking action is all that matters and all you <em>can</em> do. Action and going through the process is what gets you into flow and gives you results. Consciously focus on feeling good about yourself after taking each little step.</p>
<p>Here’s a great talk on applying this principle in pick up:</p>
<div class="flex-video youtube widescreen">

</div>

<h3>Immediate gratification</h3>
<p>To get into the flow, you need the actions you take to feel rewarding. You need to find a way to immediately see results of your actions, to measure how well you’re doing, and receive positive reinforcement once you accomplish it.</p>
<h3>Understand what you do.</h3>
<p>Don’t just go through the motions, this is the best state-killer. Have a clear plan, clear goal, understand each step that you take.</p>
<p>Make sure that you’re in charge and in control of what’s happening. Flow is about thinking and working with your mind, solving tasks, and knowing what you do and how you’re doing it.</p>
<p>Don’t try to replace this by going through random motions. Realize that rushing does not makes you more effective. What makes you faster and more effective — is skill, careful and calm thinking, planning, understanding, consciously applying the principles.</p>
<h3>Let go of or get back to basics.</h3>
<p>Once you’re already in the strong flow constantly checking out the principles may become a distraction. So once you’re in and it’s working — you may want to let go of the principles, and just enjoy being in the flow.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it stops working and you’re feeling like you’re falling out of the process — don’t try to bruteforce through it. Stop. Think. Look at the checklist of the main principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do I have a good task?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am iI focused or distracted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do I jave a crystal clear understanding of what I’m doing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Find out what you’re not doing. Fix it. It’s not about power, it’s about simply going through the right actions.</p>

	    <p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*oPdaWM8EP7BotLVE.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here are my favorite principles of learning, ideas that will help you to acquire skill in the fastest and the most efficient way.</p>
<h3>Massive action.</h3>
<p>First of all — take massive action. Learning without doing — it’s like reading books about body building without ever going to the gym.</p>
<p>Your knowledge about the subject is like a map that shows you how to get to the goal. Action — is actually moving forward and walking a way towards it.
Find a minimum of necessary knowledge to be able to start acting — and then act. Don’t procrastinate by reading tons of books before you start. You will learn all the information that you need along the way. Come up with a practical challenge, figure out the first little step that you need to take — and then take it. If you’re reading information for a good practical reason you will learn it so much faster.</p>
<p>This is the main force behind progress, this is the source of real experience.</p>
<h3>Deliberate practice.</h3>
<p>Second, and equally important principle. Deliberate practice means consciously setting challenges for yourself and solving them. Constantly pushing forward instead of just going through the repetitive motions. Always figure out how to do new things that are a little above your current level.</p>
<p>Set new challenges that are hard to accomplish, understand how to accomplish them, and then repeat it until they feel automatic.</p>
<h3>Cultivate your passion</h3>
<p>Enjoying what you do is crucial. You <em>need</em> to love what you do to get really good, it is not optional. If you don’t love what you do — you’re doing it wrong. Getting mastery at anything is a long process, it’s a marathon, not a sprint, and you won’t get too far relying only on your will power. They say that you need 10000 hours of practice to become a pro, nobody can put so much effort into something if it’s not fun.</p>
<p>And also life is to short to do things that you don’t like.</p>
<p>But if you don’t feel a strong passion now — don’t worry. Passion is not a preexisting quality that you either have or don’t have. It is something that you can learn and develop. Look for ways to do that.</p>
<h3>Thinking. Understanding first, speed and efficiency — later.</h3>
<p>Don’t rely on your subconsciousness. Don’t expect to get good by mindlessly doing something over and over again, without understanding how, hoping that you’re “training your subconsciousness”, hoping that mere repetition will make you better.</p>
<p>Start with doing things slowly, understand each step. And <em>then</em> your brain gets used to it and automates the process, which enables you to do it faster or focus on more precise details. But don’t try to skip to this part, don’t hope that you can get good without detailed understanding of how you’re doing it, understanding always comes first.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*F7Hu2xLZNEt0OlDn.png" /></p>
<h3>Learn to get in the flow.</h3>
<p>Flow is a state of being completely immersed in what you’re doing. When you’re in flow you’re completely focused, present, and very efficient. This state feels incredibly good, and makes you extremely productive. Read <a href="https://medium.com/orange-mind/tips-on-achieving-the-flow-fea7204daaf5">this post</a> for tips on how to achieve it.</p>
<h3>Consistency(is more important than speed)</h3>
<p>Getting good at something is a long term task. Getting better consistently is a lot more important than getting better fast. Approach everything you do with that idea in mind. Do not rush, keep in mind the big picture. Make sure that you’re not stressing yourself out so you won’t quit.</p>
<p>Take care of your health. Make sure that your lifestyle is sustainable. You need to keep steady pace, you need to be able to keep doing what you’re doing years down the line.</p>
<p>Develop habits that you can do every day that will naturally lead you to where you want to be in a long term.</p>
<h3>Learn Inner game</h3>
<p>Every<strong> </strong>activity has “outer game” — things that you do physically, your technical skills; and “inner game” — your attitudes to what you do, your mindset, everything that happens in your head while you’re doing it. Inner game is equally important, so learn it, pay attention to it. It includes your ability to focus and deal with stress, your state of mind, your emotional intelligence, your ability to focus, proactively set and accomplish goals, etc. If you’re stuck or unable to move forward — it is possible that your problem is not in knowledge or in technical execution, but in your inner game.</p>
<h3>Using goals</h3>
<p>Set <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> goals. Have a plan.</p>
<p>This is most useful way to move forward and not get lost. Reflect on your major life long-term goals, break them down into smaller ones, that you can accomplish in relatively short period of time. Breakdown smaller ones even further — you can set your weekly, your daily goals. This is amazing way to make any task manageable, to track your progress, to be effective.</p>
<p>This will help you to be sure that you know what you do and that you can do it.</p>
<h3>Know that you can</h3>
<p>If you’ll do anything for 10 years straight — there’s no way you won’t become a master(of course, some level of brain usage required). Understand that if you won’t quit — success is inevitable. Don’t let anybody mess with your confidence, to tell you what you can’t do.</p>
<p>There’s a difference between intelligent course-correcting and irrational fears/doubts. It’s a cliche — but “believe in yourself”. Once you have made a decision — don’t doubt it. If failing is not an option for you — you won’t fail.</p>
<p>Don’t compare yourself to the masters and think “I’ll never be able to do this”, it will just stand in your way and waste your time. Just focus on practice.</p>

            <a href="/post/expected-utility"><h1>Expected Utility</h1></a>
	    <hr/>
	  </header>

	  <p>
	    <p>Imagine I offer you a gamble. I will spin the wheel that looks like this:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/expected-value-1.png" style="width:auto;"/>
</div>

<p>And you win the amount of money that it will choose. If it hits a negative number you owe me that much. Should you play or not?</p>
<p>This is the kind of problem you are solving every time you are trying to decide whether or not to take any risky action.</p>
<p>It comes down to figuring out whether the action has a positive or negative value to you, so called Expected Utility, whether it’s benefits outweigh the potential risks.</p>
<p>To find out the answer, you need to know the sum of all the potential benefits multiplied by their probability, and compare it to the benefits and probability of the risks.</p>
<p>So first we estimate probabilities of each outcome:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/expected-value-2.png" style="width:auto;"/>
</div>

<p>And then we calculate our upside:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$20<em>0.3 + $15</em>0.2 + $5*0.2 = $10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the downside:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-$10<em>0.2 - $30</em>0.1 = -$5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we can see that the expected utility of playing this game is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$10 - $5 = $5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we know that if you play this game many times, on average, you will be making $5 every game, so that’s a good deal.</p>
<p>This is a very useful concept, because when you think like that about every action you take, you end up making much better decisions. You don’t take dumb risks, and you don’t miss great opportunities.</p>
<p>In life, we need to make decisions under uncertainty. When you know your values, and take actions with maximum expected utility, you can take the optimal way towards achieving your goals.</p>

            <a href="/post/rationalization"><h1>Rationalization</h1></a>
	    <hr/>
	  </header>

	  <p>
	    <p>You see this beautiful girl standing across the room. You would like to approach her and start a conversation, but then you think to yourself “Nah, she probably has a boyfriend. Also she wouldn’t like me anyway. Not to mention that I need to focus on studying, I don’t really have time for relationships.” So you look away, go home, play World of Warcraft, eat a pizza, feed your cats, hump your human-sized action figure of Chewbacca, go to sleep, and die alone.</p>
<p>Were your excuses the <strong>actual</strong> reasons for not approaching? Imagine if you’d know with 100% certainty that you will not get rejected, would you still decide that you’d rather focus on studying?</p>
<p><strong>Rationalization</strong> means coming up with seemingly logical/rational explanations for irrational behavior. We do whatever feels good, or whatever is easy/convenient/profitable, and then come up with explanations that make us feel better about our decisions.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to buy a new car. You don’t know much about the recent models, so you research, select a few options, look at their specs, make the list of pros and cons of each one. At the bottom the list, you finally write down your decison.</p>
<p>Now let’s say you’re a salesman, and your job is to sell a certain model. You take a sheet of paper, and at the bottom you write “and that’s is why this is the best car ever”. Then you do your research, compare options, and above the bottom line, you write a list of reasons why that’s the best model.</p>
<p>You are not lying, all the reasons are true, but you started thinking about them after the choice has already been determined. Your answer was already either true or false before you came up with explanations, and they <em>could not change your choice</em>. Your <strong>actual</strong>reason for making it was “that’s my job to sell this car”.</p>
<p>It is impossible to make a choice or belief rational even by using the smartest, most convincing arguments. The purpose of rationality is not to argue convincingly for a position, but to decide which position to argue for. Once your position is fixed, it can not become more rational. Rationality takes evidence and knowledge and looks for the best, most accurate conclusions. Rationalization runs in reverse, it starts with the conclusion and searches for reasons. If you already know your answer — thinking about it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Your success is determined by how good your decisions are, and when you are rationalizing, the actual algorithm you are using to make decisions is “whatever feels good”.</p>
<p>So how do you defeat rationalization? First of all, it comes down to being aware of it, and being honest with yourself. Always ask — what are the <strong>actual</strong> reasons for my beliefs/decisions/actions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you eating this ice cream because “well, it has nuts in it, so it’s actually kinda healthy” or because it tastes good?</li>
<li>Are you playing this computer game because “life is to be enjoyed”, and this game actually brings you joy? It is the best thing you want to do with your life right now, or just the easiest?</li>
<li>Do you skip gym this time because it’s the best day to take a break and let your body rest and restore, or because it’s raining outside?</li>
<li>Now that you didn’t get that job, it doesn’t seem that great, is it because didn’t actually want it anyway?</li>
</ul>
<p>And be suspicious when your explanations conveniently happen to give you the permission to do the thing you wanted to do before coming up with them, or make you feel better about doing/believing things that you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do keep your religion because it’s a “good moral guidance”, because it makes sense, or because your parents believed in it?</li>
<li>Are you defending piracy because “it actually helps companies to promote their content, so it’s not a big deal, also information should be free”, or because it’s really convenient to watch a free movie?</li>
<li>Is your city or country actually the best place in the world, or do you like it because you were born here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also notice that when you are looking for answers that you don’t already know, you feel curious, you are craving to know the answer, yet rationalization usually makes you more confident/comfortable/justified.</p>

            <a href="/post/sunk-cost-fallacy"><h1>Sunk Cost Fallacy</h1></a>
	    <hr/>
	  </header>

	  <p>
	    <p>Let’s say you’ve been planning to go see a movie this Friday, and have already bought a ticket, but now that it’s time to go out you realize that you don’t want to go, and that you would rather enjoy spending your evening at home. Should you go or not?</p>
<p>Most of the people say yes, after all, the ticket has already been paid for, and it’s nonrefundable, so you wouldn’t want it to be wasted, right?</p>
<p>That is called a Sunk Cost Fallacy — the ​idea that people tend to stick with the courses of action they have ​invested ​money, ​time, or ​effort in, ​even when continuing is not the best thing to do.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it’s irrational to let the costs that we can’t recover to influence our decisions, only future costs and benefits should matter. But we don’t want to admit our mistakes, to “waste” our investment, so we often stick by our past choices that continue costing us more.</p>
<p>The movie example may not make it seem like a big deal, but this fallacy often leads to more significant consequences. Many people stick with professions they dislike because they have spent that all this money and time on getting their degree. They often don’t consider that starting over is better than being miserable for the rest of your career. Or people stay in unhappy relationships because of all the time they have invested in them.</p>
<p>To overcome this fallacy — be aware of it, ask yourself where do I fall victim to it. Learn to recognize it, and once you do —admit that it’s irrational.</p>
<p>People often commit this fallacy not because they think it’s logical, but because they are emotionally invested in the effort they put in, so you need to understand that sometimes it’s better to let go. Imagine that you’ve just been dropped into your current life situation with no warning, and do what is in your best interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have realized half way through reading a book that it’s not useful or interesting — give it up.</li>
<li>Are you trying to finish eating this sandwich because it’s already been paid for, even though you’re not hungry? Throw it away, it doesn’t benefit anybody.</li>
<li>Do you keep going to a bad/useless class that you’ve paid a lot of money for? You probably don’t need to.</li>
<li>Did you put so much sweat in writing this scene in your screenplay, only to realize that it doesn’t make the movie better? Cut it out.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, I don’t mean to say that you should be wasteful, it’s always wise to try anticipating such things in advance and to avoid doing them in the first place. But once you did, don’t spend even more energy on it, realize that putting more time into it wont make it more worth it, cut your losses, and move on.</p>
<p>You can’t get your money, energy and time back, but you can still make yourself happier.</p>

            <a href="/post/confirmation-bias"><h1>Confirmation Bias</h1></a>
	    <hr/>
	  </header>

	  <p>
	    <p>Let’s say your elbow is itchy, and you are starting to fear that it might be serious. You type in google “itchy elbow, serious symptom”, and in 20 minutes you are convinced that you have elbow cancer, space AIDS, and a severe case of acute ladidadidosis. The more you search, the more certain you are of your impending doom.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-1.png" /></p>
<p>In a similar fashion, you may type “dolphins are racist”, and find out all about dolphins being the secret force behind holocaust.</p>
<p>You can easily find a confirmation for any belief, and people often do.</p>
<p><strong>We tend to look for information that confirms our beliefs.</strong> We jump to conclusions, assume that our initial guess is correct, and then look for evidence that supports it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-2.png" /></p>
<p>That is called <strong>confirmation bias</strong>, and it has many effects that prevent us from being more intelligent and developing accurate beliefs.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-3.png" /></p>
<p><strong>We set higher standards for evidence that disagrees with our ideas.</strong> For example, if you don’t believe in evolution, you may say that this is because there’s a gap in the fossils between monkeys and humans, and so there’s not enough evidence to prove that evolution is true. At the same time, you may have no problem taking an old book and the words of a priest as a convncing support for your beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>When information is ambiguous, we tend to interpret it as supporting our existing position.</strong> Lets say someone was rude to you the first time youve met, then the next time he does something nice, you may think that he’s just being manipulative or wants something from you, so you become even more convinced that this is a bad person. On the other hand if the first time you’ve met someone he was nice, and is now he’s acting like a jerk, you may just assume that he’s simply having a bad day.</p>
<p><strong>Also, we remember things selectively — facts that prove us right are easier to recall.</strong> People who believe in horoscopes, probably do that because they can easily remember all the times horoscopes were right, and forget or ignore countless times they were wrong.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-4.png" /></p>
<p>To overcome confirmation bias, try to balance the sources you get your information from, to look at the both sides of the argument, think about what kind of evidence would disprove your theory, and actively search for things that challenge your beliefs.</p>

            <a href="/post/what-are-cognitive-biases"><h1>What are Cognitive Biases?</h1></a>
	    <hr/>
	  </header>

	  <p>
	    <p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-1.png" />
Imagine you have a basket of fruits(apples and oranges), you reach out, take one at random, and eat it. Then you decide you’re hungry, and eat a few more. At that point you realize that you ate like 5 apples and only one orange, so you think that there’s way more apples in there. Makes sense.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-2.png" />
Now you reach into a different basket, and grab a bunch of berries —5 strawberries and 10 blueberries. Should you think that there’s 2 times more blueberries here? Not really, because strawberries are bigger and heavier, so there’s more of them at the bottom of the basket than at the top, and your estimate would be biased.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-3.png" /></p>
<p>This is called statistical bias. When your information is skewed, you form an inaccurate picture of the world. You could try to gather more data, but it wouldn’t help, because the way you gather it is fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-4.png" /></p>
<p>But now imagine you reach into the third basket, and holy shit! — it’s dollar bills! You’re rich, you’ll finally be able to buy your own giraffe, you always wanted one.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-5.png" /></p>
<p>Then you notice that some of the bills are $100, and other’s are only $5. But you think most of bills in the bag are probably $100, right? I mean you really wish they were, after all, giraffes are expensive, and you don’t want to settle for buying some lame capybara at this point.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-6.png" /></p>
<p>In this case your expectation is incorrect not because you have wrong information, but because it’s influenced by a different kind of bias — a cognitive bias.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-7.png" /></p>
<p>Because our brain does not have the time and energy to accurately process all the information it perceives, it takes mental shortcuts(called heuristics). Most of the time they are useful, but often they mislead us and result in systematic errors in our thinking — that is what cognitive biases are.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-8.png" /></p>
<p>Just like statistical biases, cognitive biases distort your picture of the world, and when your method of learning about the world is flawed, gathering more information will not help to correct the error, in fact it can even worsen it.</p>
<p>These biases prevent us from having accurate beliefs, making good decisions, and achieving our goals. Sometimes they result in small mistakes(like losing some money by playing a lottery), sometimes mistakes are not so small(burning witches, holocaust, me watching Star Wars prequels).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-9.png" /></p>
<p>Cognitive biases are not a result of being an unfair or a dishonest person, they are not committed by choice, they are a fundamental property of how humans think, they are flaws in the lens through which we look at the world. Being biased is like having a miscalibrated measuring instrument, except in this case the instrument is your brain.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-10.png" /></p>
<p>So how do we fix it? Instead of relying on our natural hunches and intuitions, we can learn to recognize our mistakes, and then use superior tools(rationality and logic) to correct them.</p>
<p>A good place to start is to learn about the types of biases, fallacies, and the cognitive tools we can use to prevent them, which is what this series of posts is about.</p>

<p>Story is made out of series of <strong>events</strong>. The sequence of all the events is called a <strong>Plot</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Event</strong> is a meaningful change in character’s life, the thing that happens during a story that transforms the world from one state into another.</p>
<p>During a story, the main character(<strong>protagonist</strong>) goes through a series of events, each of them <em>taking him closer to, or farther away from</em> his <strong>Goal</strong>.</p>
<p>This series of events culminates in <strong>Climax </strong>— the major, most important event of a story, <strong>the moment when protagonist achieves his goal </strong>(or, less often, fails to achieve it).</p>
<p>Climax is what the story is about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Frodo drops the ring into the Mount Doom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luke destroys the Death Star</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neo defeats the Agent Smith</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Story is divided into 3 Acts.</p>
<p>The<strong> first act </strong>is about protagonist’s normal, regular life being <em>disrupted </em>by some event. This event is called <strong>Inciting Incident</strong>(IInc).</p>
<p>IIncs is the main reason the story has happened, the thing that kicks off the series of events that lead to climax.</p>
<p>IInc gives protagonist a <em>challenge</em>, creares a <strong>Goal</strong> — the main value for a character, the thing he will be trying to achieve for the rest of the story. Usually, it is the result of a <em>problem</em> created by antagonist.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gandalf gives Frodo the Ring he will have to drop into Mount Doom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luke hears the message from Princess Leia about the plans he will have to use to destroy the Death Star</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neo meets Morpheus, who will tell him about the Matrix, which he will have to destroy to liberate humanity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first act culminates in the <strong>First Turning Point</strong>(TP1).</p>
<p>TP1 is the moment when <em>hero decides to go on adventure</em>. Me<em> makes a conscious decision to <strong>engage</strong> with a story, </em>and starts striving to achieve his goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Frodo leaves the Shire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neo takes the red pill</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second act</strong> is about the series of escalating events(successes and failures) that happen as protagonist struggles to achieve his goal.</p>
<p>Hero pursues his goal, and <em>overcomes the obstacles</em> set by antagonist. From his victories and mistakes he <em>learns lessons</em> about the world, and gains powers.</p>
<p>As hero moves further, stakes rise, protagonist’s commitment to the goal increases, he has to apply more effort and take bigger and bigger risks to move forward.</p>
<p>In the middle of second act, protagonist goes through the <strong>Mid Point</strong> (MP)—<strong> </strong>the <strong>point of no return</strong>. He swims pass the middle of the river, and now turning back is harder than reaching the other shore.</p>
<p>Stakes continue to escalate, until he has to <strong>risk everytning </strong>in his biggest attempt to win. He <em>engages in <strong>final battle</strong> against the antagonist, and puts everything on the line.</em></p>
<p>Second act culminates in the <strong>Second Turning Point</strong>(TP2) — the moment when hero’s biggest attempt <em>fails</em>, when <strong>all is lost</strong>, the goal is no longer attainable, when antagonist seems to win and the protagonist is <em>defeated</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>third act </strong>is about the final battle and it’s outcome.</p>
<p>Defeated, half-dead hero <em>learns his biggest lesson from his worst failure.</em></p>
<p>This is usually when the biggest <strong><em>twist</em></strong> happens. Hero <em>sees the truth. </em>Comes up with a brilliant creative solution, understands his mistake, finds the mega weapon, realizes who was the murderer all along, etc. This is what will enable him to turn lose into win.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Harry has a basilisk fang</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neo sees the Matrix code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unnamed narrator holds a gun</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Armed with this knowledge he gathers all of his strength, and takes the final effort to turn things around, to win the battle.</p>
<p>Hero defeats the antagonist and <strong>finally achieves his goal</strong>.</p>
	  </p>

<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote <em><a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a></em> — a brilliant story that blew people’s minds, and created the genre of Rationalist Fiction. People who loved it created a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rational">community</a> for sharing similar stories, discussing Rational and Rationalist Fiction, and writing HPMOR-inspired works.</p>
<p>If you want to get a general picture of why this thing is awesome, but not sure whether you are ready to read something big, you can take a look at <em><a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/64">Lord of Rationality</a>,</em> a rational take on The Lord of the Rings.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of Rationalist Fiction:</h2>
<p><strong>World with sane and consistent rules</strong><br />
The rules of the fictional world are clearly defined, consistent and intended to stand up to careful thought. The world evolves logically from its premise, and explores possibilities and implications in a coherent and scientific way.</p>
<p><strong>Realistic motivations</strong><br />
Characters act as real humans would. No one is just evil for the hell of it, conflicts are driven by differences in values, and the villains (to the extent there even are villains) have a real and honest point to their actions.
The story’s plot and characters aren’t propelled forward by a lack of communication or by idiocy. Nothing happens solely because “the plot requires it”. If characters do (or don’t do) something, there must be a plausible reason.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence</strong><br />
Rationalist stories show characters acting and thinking intelligently, and being good at it. The heroes think clearly, in ways the reader can follow and understand, as opposed to “magically” coming up with solutions because they’ve “read the script” (a la Sherlock Holmes).</p>
<p>They use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rationality and logic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intelligence and cunning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of science and technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creativity and inventiveness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychological manipulation and Social Engineering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complex Machiavellian plots</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to solve their problems and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Characters are <strong>gaming the system</strong> — they understand and exploit the rules of the world, they cheat and manipulate it into the desired outcome. The hero’s brain is his main “superpower” and his primary advantage over others.</p>
<p>Nobody important is stupid. None of the main heroes or main villains hold the IdiotBall. Rational protagonists often face rational (or at least very intelligent) opposition to maintain the story’s power balance.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching rationality</strong><br />
Rationalist stories make a deliberate effort to reward the reader’s thinking, and teach him to get better at it. Characters are explicitly using and teaching others rationalist techniques, and showing the practical thinking processes which can be applied by readers.</p>
<p>We can see characters being smart, not just be told that they are smart. They think of brilliant things to do which we ourselves could have realized are possible. The character’s “brilliance” is conferred not by mutation or native brilliance alone, but follows from the explicit rules of thought, which readers are intended to pick up from the story and use in real life.</p>
<p><strong>“Solvable” plot</strong><br />
The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story. The character’s motivations and the world’s rules are being presented in such a way that a clever reader can deduce what’s hidden and predict what’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>Deconstruction</strong><br />
Rationalist fanfiction often involves “deconstructing” the world: taking the story apart, pointing out contradictions, criticizing inconsistencies, and fixing flaws.</p>
<p>The stories look at what would happen if the story would take place in the “Real World”. Original stories often ignore things like “what impact a magic that creates food out of nothing would have on society and the world”, and rational fanfiction explores the consequences that the author of the story haven’t predicted.</p>
<p>An original rationalist story may deconstruct tropes. It may take popular cliches/plot-devices/folklore and look at what would happen in they were happening in reality .</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*T79diiytnwzDE0nI." /></p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong><br />
Rationalist stories tend to be about science, technology, transhumanism, futurism, or artificial intelligence. Characters want to optimize the world or end death rather than get the girl, save the kingdom, or fulfill other more typical character motivations.</p>
<h2>Defining Works</h2>
<p>The following are the stories that stand out — that helped to define the genre or are seen as ideal expressions of it.</p>
