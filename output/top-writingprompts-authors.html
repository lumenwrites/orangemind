<p>I have been experimenting with reddit API, and have decided to compile a list of the best(most upvoted) <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/">/r/WritingPrompts</a></strong> authors and their top stories.</p>
<!-- 
----

Due to the limitations of the API the data can not be 100% exact, but it's pretty close.

List includes only the authors who have written at least 5 stories, with at least 3 stories having 100+ upvotes(to exclude people who wrote only one highly upvoted story).

"Karma" is calculated based on the number of upvotes to top-level comments(to count only stories, and ignore upvotes coming from prompt submissions and other comments).
