          <h1 id="blogTitle"> Writing essay </h1>
          <hr />
	  <p>Essays are about coming up with new and surprising ideas, and then exploring them.</p>
<p>You write an essay by asking a question and typing your thinking process.</p>
<p>Looking for all the new and interesting ideas that you can find.</p>
<p>There are 2 parts to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding questions that nobody else asked before <!-- that other people usually don't --></li>
<li>Coming up with surprising and interesting ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>You ask interesting questions and look for unexpected answers.
You write to create ideas, but you don't know most of the ideas in advance, you create them in the process.</p>
<h2>Finding questions</h2>
<p>Assume that everything we know is stupid and wrong.</p>
<p>500 years ago people were dumb and wrong about pretty much everything, so it's likely that 500 years from now that is how people will going to think about us.</p>
<p>Therefore - you are trying to find things that we are wrong about, and you do that by questioning and challenging things that you know.</p>
<h3>Focus/Creative pause</h3>
<p>Creative focus is a great technique for doing that, and it is a valuable skill in itself.  </p>
<p>The goal is to find a thing that you want to question/improve/challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a thing at random<br />
  There's no reason for you to think that something is wrong about it, you just pick it at random and decide to improve it.</li>
<li>Find a thing people usually don't think about or question.  </li>
<li>What are some boring mediocre cliches and default assumptions that everyone is making?  </li>
<li>What kind of thing is likely to be wrong or just seems weird?</li>
<li>What are some things that can be improved?</li>
<li>What are some problems that can be solved?<br />
  Especially the problems people don't realize they have.</li>
<li>Stop at some random subject and ask "why are we doing that?"<br />
  Is there a good reason for the way things are, or is it just a cultural habit/historical accident?</li>
<li>What are some goals here that can be achieved?</li>
</ul>
<!-- challenge everything and ask why? -->

<p>Once you've picked a thing for a creative focus - you challenge it.</p>
<h3>Challenge:</h3>
<p>Here are the questions you can ask about a subject you've picked that should be a good creative challenges to solve.</p>
<ul>
<li>General<br />
  What are some new ideas in the area x?</li>
<li>Improve <br />
  How to improve x?</li>
<li>Solve.
  How can I solve this problem?</li>
<li>Alternatives<br />
  What are some alternatives to doing things this way?</li>
<li>Drop it<br />
  If it wouldn't exist, what would we do without it?
â€“ Achieve<br />
  How do I achieve this goal?</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of writing essay is the process of answering one of these questions, solving one of these challenges.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/post/creativity">next article</a> I will describe how to create unexpected/interesting/creative ideas.</p>
<!--
Theres objective teaching stuff, but the "soft" stuff I want is&
>>>> what do I thibk about x?
And the story stuff is:
>>>> What would happen if x?

write jokes about x.
- ask a question nobody has asked before
