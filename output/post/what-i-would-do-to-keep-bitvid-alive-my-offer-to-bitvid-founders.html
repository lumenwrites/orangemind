          <h1 id="blogTitle"> What I would do to keep bitvid alive. (+ my offer to bitvid founders) </h1>
          <hr />
	  <p>I've read the news about you guys shutting down the development of bitvid, and it saddens me. It was obviously a brilliant idea that got a lot of people very excited, I can't imagine why you would give up on that. I have very little information about the internal state of the project, but I can't stop thinking that maybe it doesn't have to die.</p>
<p>I've came up with several ideas about what could be done to keep it alive, so I would like you to read them, and possibly allow me to implement them.</p>
<h2>My plan for keeping bitvid alive.</h2>
<h3>Pivot - focus on creators</h3>
<p>Instead of trying to rival youtube right off the bat, I would build my first version of bitvid to be focused on professional video creators, people like CGP Grey, Vlogbrothers, and people who create video tutorials, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easier to develop and scale.</strong><br />
It's hard to create a video hosting service that allows people to upload 72 hours of cat videos per minute, but if you specifically target professional video creators there will be much less content, therefore - cheaper and easier to develop/scale/maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would begin by sending invites to the coolest video creators to offer them to post their videos on our website. These will be the people who are the most frustrated with youtube, and who have the most influence, and who will be happy to use a different website with much better functionality.</p>
<p>Hosting videos(at first) for 10-20 content creators would definitely be possible, would allow us to receive the feedback, and focus on building the perfect tool for these people.</p>
<p>Expanding to the larger audience later will not be an issue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Much better content quality</strong><br />
Obviously, that would also result in a much superior content quality. </li>
</ul>
<p>Which, again, would make the scaling task easier, and at the same time improve the quality of the website.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Therefore - much better community</strong><br />
Instead of building a 2nd youtube I would make bitvid to be what Hacker News is to reddit - much smaller community, much better content.</li>
</ul>
<p>That would discourage people from uploading a lot of bad videos, and create a culture of sharing only really cool and worthy content. </p>
<p>That would result in much superior comments/discusion as well.</p>
<p>And only after that would I try to scale to the rest of the population(read "Crossing the Chasm").</p>
<h3>Build the simplest MVP possible</h3>
<p>I would complete and deploy the simplest, most minimal version of the website, that would have just enough features to be usable. All we need at the beginning is a website that can host videos for 10-20 creators(to whom we've sent out the invites).</p>
<p>If necessary - I would even outsorce the completion of this first version to some good professional freelance team - that is <strong>definitely</strong> possible, they would be able to complete it swiftly and for a reasonable price, it is being done on freelancing websites every day.</p>
<p>That would allow us to start receiving feedback immediately, and build the rest of the features over time. Besides it would show people the progress and get everyone excited, which is necessary for the next step of the plan.</p>
<h3>Crowdsourcing it: Open Source  + taking it to Kickstarter</h3>
<p>I am certain that a lot of a lot of people would be willing and happy to contribute their efforts to developing this project.</p>
<p>We would take the feedback given by users from the previous step and list the most urgent features we need to develop.</p>
<p>Some of them could be developed by the open-source contributors on the github.</p>
<p>As for the rest - we would create a campaign on the Kickstarter to receive the funding necessary to continue the development, to improve and polish our alpha version.</p>
<!-- ### Monetization - alternative methods -->

<h2>My offer to the bitvid founders.</h2>
<p>I really want bitvid to succeed, and I think that it must be possible. I don't think that you should give up on it just yet. If you have lost motivation for developing this project - I have the time and drive necessary to get it done.</p>
<p>I can invest my time/skill/energy/money into this project. Give me the access to code and domains, and I will take care of hosting/maintenance, restore the forum, organize the development, and make sure that it gets built.</p>
<p>Send me a message to raymestalez@gmail.com if you're interested.</p>
