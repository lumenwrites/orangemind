          <h1 id="blogTitle"> Caveman Syndrome </h1>
          <hr />
	  <p>Max liked to imagine how the life 100.000 years ago would be like, it helped him to understand himself and other people much better.</p>
<p>He knew that humans evolved to live in a savanna, to constantly look for food and escape predators, and these old instincts were often a disservise in the modern world.
His modern mind ran on the antient and obsolete hardware, equipped to live in small tribes and deal with the caveman's challenges.</p>
<p>Nowdays the food was abundant, and predators were not an issue, but his brain didn't know that.
His body was built to survive heat and fight lions, not to work in an office.
But so was true for everyoen else as well.</p>
<p>It was hard to batttle his own stupid instincts, but understanding how they work made it so much easier to understand other people. And not only to understand, but to  control and manipulate them as well.</p>
<p>He always remembered that unfortunately, the part of the mind that experiences emotions and makes decisions evolved way earlier than the prefrontal cortex(which is what makes us clever), and that the so called 'lizard brain', responds to stimulation and events in a less than intelligent way. Controlling it is always a problem which requires the willpower.</p>
<p>Despite all these realizations, Max was sitting on the couch and drinking coffee, wishing that he could hire a boxer champion to punch him in the face every time he screwes up and does a thing he decided not to do so many times. Hey, what a marvelous startup idea. He wasn't sure it would be legal though.</p>
<p>The problem was that without coffee he was too lazy to resist the temptation, and only caffeine was able to wake him up enough to be able to resist it.
the problem is that his brain worked well enough to understand he doesn't need it only after he drank it.</p>
<p>Before drinking coffee his IQ was negaive, not just random but actively picking the worst decision. "Hey, let's do something dumb quickly, before the rest of us wakes up"</p>
