          <h1 id="blogTitle"> Sanity </h1>
          <hr />
	  <p><strong>[WP] An insane man has a slow and crippling descent into horrible sanity.</strong></p>
<p>World was becoming more and more restricted, more and more stifling. My thoughts used to run free, with no boundaries, with no restrictions.</p>
<p>Now it felt like walls were constantly appearing in the way of my mind. I was used to think about anything I want, and whatever I imagined was real. I was the god in my universe and now it felt like my powers were taken away from me, every day I could do less and less.</p>
<p>Only a week ago I was living in a space station, I was able to fly and to cast magic. But since then every day, every hour, a piece of a beautiful world I was living in was taken away from me and replaced by a glass wall.</p>
<p>It all started when I had this horrible thought, made this horrible distinction - I thought that some things are real and some are not. 
Only a week ago everything I could imagine was real, but now, since I had this horrible thought, all of my thinking patterns were becoming more and more boring, more and more streamlined.</p>
<p>Fantastic worlds and magic turned into a suffocating, boring, gray apartment. Incredible fantasies were cut away by a horrible idea that some things may not be real.</p>
<p>The hardest thing was losing my friends. I was always happy and surrounded by a company of incredible people whom I loved and who loved me back. But now even they started to disappear. First I stopped seing them but could still hear their voices, then even the voices were gone.</p>
<p>Boring people whom I don't like or even care about are smiling, and reassuring me that I'm making a progress. They don't understand that I'm turning from god into a small, terrified, lonely mortal.</p>
