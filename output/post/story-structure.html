          <hr />	  
	  <h1>Story Structure</h1>
<h2>Main elements of the story</h2>
<p><a href="http://orangemind.io/images/story/main-parts.svg"><img alt="story" src="http://orangemind.io/images/story/main-parts.svg" /></a></p>
<p>Story = Setting + Character + Plot</p>
<p><strong>High Concept</strong>(story premise, story idea) can be a gap in one or all or between any of thouse things. It is the big new idea that makes story curious and interesting.  </p>
<h2>Plot</h2>
<p><strong>Event</strong> - is a meaningful change of value in character's life, a step closer/farther from a goal, and, in case of the Climax event - the outcome of a goal.</p>
<p>Story is about a <strong>Big Event</strong> that happens at <strong>Climax</strong>, a moment when character achieves his  <strong>Goal</strong>(or, less frequently, fails to achieve it).</p>
<p>The Goal is the main value for a character in a story.</p>
<p><strong>Inciting Incident</strong>(IInc) is the first event of the story, a moment when a main story Goal is created.</p>
<p>Story consists of <strong>Scenes</strong> - smaller events, steps closer-to/farther-away from a Goal.</p>
<p>Everything inbetween IInc and a Climax is about struggling to achieve the goal, series of successful/failed attempts to move closer to the goal, that eventually succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Plot</strong> is a sequence of all the events in a story put together.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangemind.io/images/story/plot.svg"><img alt="plot" src="http://orangemind.io/images/story/plot.svg" /></a></p>
<h3>Turning points</h3>
<p><strong>Turning points</strong> are the most important events(scenes) that happen between the IInc and a Climax.</p>
<p>The turning points are the major changes in action.</p>
<p>This is how character goes about achieving his goal. Attempts that he makes to get what he want, and his major successes/failures.</p>
<p><strong>IInc</strong> is a moment where natural course of character's life is disturbed/upset with something, the moment that creates a big goal for him to achieve. It is when the story's main Challenge/Problem is created, and the moment that creates a Goal.</p>
<p>From here, as he goes forward, things <em>escalate</em>, <em>stakes</em> get higher, and his commitment to the goal increases.</p>
<p><strong>TP1</strong>(first Turning Point) is a moment where character decides to go after the goal, makes his first attempt/step towards getting it. <!-- Engage --></p>
<p><strong>MP</strong>(Mid-Point) is a point of no return, of full commitment to the goal.<br />
Imagine crossing a river, MP is the moment where character is closer to the other shore(achieving his goal) than to the one he left(the natural course of his life). He can still sink or he can achieve his goal, but now there's no point of going back.</p>
<p><strong>TP2</strong>(second Turning Point) is a moment when character loses everything and goal seems unattainable. This is the last attempt that dramatically fails.</p>
<p><strong>Creative solution</strong>(in my favorite stories - brilliant elaborate Machiavellian plot) - the idea that a character comes up with, the plan that he executes to achieve his goal. That enables him to go from "all is lost" to a climax, to turn lose into win.</p>
<p><strong>Climax</strong> is a major reversal, turning of lose into a win, the moment when character, despite all the odds, makes the last desperate attempt to achieve his goal and succeeds.</p>
<h3>Protagonist</h3>
<p>Protagonist is a central character of a story.</p>
<p>For a reader to care about what will happen in a story he needs need to <em>value</em> the goals, care about winning and losing.</p>
<p>Protagonist is a reader's "<em>avatar</em>" - reader empathises with him, and experiences the story through his eyes.</p>
<p>Everything that is valuable to a character is valuable to the reader, so that when character goes from event to event achieving and losing things, wining and failing, reader experiences everything that happens to character as if it happens to him, learns lessons, engages in conflicts, makes decisions, celebrates victories and suffers defeat.</p>
<p>That is what draws person into a story and makes him engaged.</p>
<h2>High Concept and Curiosity Gap</h2>
<p>High Concept(HC) is the new idea that you come up with when you begin to write a story.
It is what makes it interesting, makes you curious to see what will happen, and makes reader to want to read it.</p>
<p>HC can be a new idea based on any of the main elements of the story or the combination of them.</p>
<p>To come up with HC you take some boring and default Character/Setting/IInc, and then turn it into something exciting and interesting, or come up with an interesting and unusual combination of a couple of these elements.</p>
<p>For convenience I define 2 main types of HC:</p>
<p><strong>Scifi-HC</strong> - it is basically a new and interesting <em>setting</em>/<em>character</em>.<br />
Because sci-fi(and fantasy) are mostly based on new intteresting worlds or superpowers and such, the main idea you begin writing sci-fi with is a new and cool setting(world) or a cool character.</p>
<p><strong>Story-HC</strong> - it is an idea of a new and creative <em>IInc</em> - unusual goal or a challenge to solve.
This is what most non-scifi stories start with, and actually is the majority of ideas in fictoinal novels/tv-shows.</p>
<p>For example Scifi-HC can be something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boy goes to a school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</li>
<li>A team of space pirates and their adventures.</li>
<li>People can enter other people's dreams.</li>
<li>Plane crashes on a mysterious island.</li>
</ul>
<p>Story-HC's can be based on various parts of the story that are not world-building:</p>
<ul>
<li>Character:<br />
  A serial killer who kills only bad guys.</li>
<li>IInc:<br />
  An evil shark attacking a beach.</li>
<li>Goal:<br />
  Brilliant engineer has to break his brother out of prison  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Curiosity Gap("hook", "cliff hanger")</h2>
<p>This is a question you ask at the beginning of the story that a reader wants to get the answer to, it is a "hook" that is supposed to grab the attention and spark curiosity</p>
<p>Sicne HC is the main idea that makes your story interesting, Curiosity Gap is naturally based on HC. It is a promise of cool things to come, expression of HC. It is a questioin that reader wants an answer to very badly.</p>
<p>Formally, the main "hook" of the story is the question created by the IInc, the question such as "Whether the character will succeed or not?", or "What will happen at the climax".</p>
<p>And the "cliff hangers" is a similar kind of questions you ask throughout the story, to keep the reader's attention and curiousity.</p>
<p>The answer to what makes the Curiousity Gap interesting is the same as to what makes your story interesting.</p>
<p>Here's a few examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transformers start with the scenes of big robots fighting<br />
Detective stories start with a mysterious murder<br />
Harry Potter starts wit magicians and flying motorcycles and Voldemort's attack<br />
Lost starts with a man in a suit waking up in the middle of a mysterious island<br />
Inception starts with stealing an idea from a dream<br />
Fight Club begins with a dude with a gun in his mouth<br />
Tangled and Megamind begin with "this is a story of how I've died"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Antagonist and the problem</h2>
<p>But the most common and straightforward way to come up with a Story-HC is to come up with a Problem that character needs to solve, because it is a great starting point for finding all the other elements. IInc is how character got this probem, TP1 is when he decides to solve it, Climax is his solution.</p>
<p>And the most straightforward way to come up with a problem - is to come up with the <strong>Opposition</strong>(the <strong>antagoinst</strong>). Antagonist is the source of 80% of the story's problems and obstacles.</p>
<h2>Climax</h2>
<p>Once you have the High Concept and the Problem, the most challenging thing to figure out is the main Event of the story(Climax), which is a solution to the probem.</p>
<p>IInc and Climax are the 2 sides of the same idea - the Goal.
IInc creates a goal/problem, and at the climax character achieves/solves it.</p>
<p>Note:<br />
When you are coming up coming up with the problem - you DON'T have to know how to achieve it.
You start by finding a problem, and you look for the ways to solve it in the next step.
As you come up with the steps character takes to the goal, you will have a more clear idea what the resolution will be. This is the process of plotting, and it is convenient to keep it separate from the progess of generating HC.</p>
<h2>Scene</h2>
<p>When you know how the story starts(IInc) and where it's going(the Climax), you can break it down into steps.</p>
<p>Scenes are essentially micro-stories.</p>
<p>They are also about events, step closer/farther away from the goal.</p>
<p>They are about achieving or failing to achieve subgoals, attempts to move forward towards a bigger goal.</p>
<p>One difference to note is that big Story-Events usually(though not always) end up witch a character achieving his goal(Happy Ending), the Scene-Events are about 50/50 between achieving/failing the goal.</p>
<p>Usually alternate, win-lose-win-lose, etc.</p>
<h2>Story Writing Process</h2>
<h2>Bottom-up vs Top-down writing. Developing a story.</h2>
<!-- You write story by figuring out the answers to the questions above. -->

<p>There are 2 ways to approach the writing process:<br />
<strong>Bottom-up(discovery) writing</strong> - you take any small random element of a story and just start writing, exploring world from there as you go.<br />
<strong>Outline-writing.</strong> - you start with creating the outline, figuring out the main points of a story, and then breaking them down into scenes and adding more details.</p>
<p>The problem with bottom-up writing is that you don't have very much control over the story.
Your story goes wherever your imagination takes you at the current moment, so it's hard to control the high-level design.</p>
<p>The problem with outline-writing is that if you write outline first, it is very hard to come up with the perfect answers to all of the questions, because when you begin you don't know anything about the world or the story.</p>
<p>Which is why it is a good idea to do both at the same time, and treat writing process more like <em>programming</em>. Think of bottom-up writing as writing code, and think about outline-writing as thinking about the higher-level design(drawing UML diagrams or some such).</p>
<p>You can't sit down and write a program from start to finish, line by line. And you can't design it perfectly top-down either.
You think on several levels of abstraction. You write small functions and you think about the high-level design at the same time, there's a lot of placeholders, you start with simple prototypes and then improve and extend, and fill in the gaps as you go.</p>
<p>Another important thing is to treat everything as a <strong>procedural</strong> process, where everything is a subject to change. <!-- Everything you do is flexible, more like x than like y --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't write it like a letter, <em>develop</em> it like a program</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very hard to commit to bottom-up writing without knowing the outline of the story, and it's hard to commit to the outline of the story without knowing the details about the world.</p>
<p>That is why you start with some small part that you can imagine now <!-- penetration point + beacons -->, and then you ask questions and explore from there. <!-- simulation, prediction -->
You take an interesting situation and simulate what happens next, and search for answers to the high-level questions.</p>

<!-- 
## Writing path

Process should lead. Once you've got the understanding of everything above - you practice, and pick up everything else as a side-effect, during the process.

You tweak and improve and all that as you go, no need to get caught up in small minute details before beginning the process. Information above should be enough to write a basic story, from there you get better and understand further details.
 -->

<!-- Practice should lead You do not think>code, you code>think -->

<!-- ### CI. -->

<!--
**CI**(Controlling Idea) is the "lesson" character(and reader) learns throughout the story, the reasonf for a meaningful change(Event) to occur.
-->

<!-- The thing that changes the character and enables him to win. -->

<!-- CI/Lesson/moral/Character arc. = Lesson the character learns. -->

<!-- Twist. Creative solution. -->

<!-- **Twist** - is a plot twist that happens before the climax that creates the rush of the insight. The "Luke, I'm your father" kind of a thing. -->

<!-- 2nd lane through the story. -->
