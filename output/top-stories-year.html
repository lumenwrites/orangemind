<p>Score: 3892</p>
<p>The house was filled with tears of sadness, joy and laughter. Long hugs, intense and heartfelt kisses, jokes to cheer up the inevitability of a saddened mood. Chris sat on the couch, surrounded by his friends and his family, and he couldn't but smile. The melancholy of the situation weighed on him, and yet there was this feeling that he couldn't shake off. ''If we have to go, then this is a pretty decent way of going.''</p>
<p>The crash of the two planets had been predicted to happen at 5:55AM EST, 25th October 2015. The planet had come in NASA's sights roughly a month ago, and from that moment on everything changed.</p>
<p>There was of course an uproar. People panicked, immediately thinking the world was about to end. It was 2012 all over again, with mass conspirators claiming they had seen it coming and that the USA, the UN or the lizard people were the cause of it. The closer we got to 31th since that moment, the more the average people started to dread. The governments kept people updated, but after a while the impending doom was wide-spread. ''If they would've been able to do something about, they would've, by now'' was the train of thought most people had. And when the rocket launches NASA did failed and didn't alter the planet's course for five times, people lost hope.</p>
<p>Since that moment some people died, thinking it was better to take fate into own hands. Others got careless with drugs and died by overdose. The others just kept going. Irrelevant jobs were abandoned, but luckily a large amount of people volunteered to keep doing the important jobs like rail roads and food supply for that last month.</p>
<p>All the people who were still with us on this 24th day of October had accepted whatever was coming from them. Chris had too. What other choice did he have? It was not like he could do anything about it. He didn't have the knowledge, nor the time.</p>
<p>Chris drifted off, knowing he would be woken if anything important was to happen. He woke up, hours later, in a dead silent room. His heart jumped, his sight still foggy from his deep slumber. Did he miss it? Was it over already? Of course not. Why would I be alive then? Wait? What if we survived? He rubbed in his eyes to regain vision. He looked around.</p>
<p>Nothing moved. Absolutely nothing happened.</p>
<p>''Hello? People?''</p>
<p>No reaction. Not a sound, not a movement, not a blink of an eye. </p>
<p>And then a sharp pain in his forearm. He looked down and saw a smear of blood. ''What the hell?'' Chris shouted while he shot up from the couch. Holding his breath he walked to the sink confused and cleared up the blood with a splash of water. As he dried it with a paper towel, he could read an etching engraved into his arm. It already had the faded pink color of a scar gotten long ago, and it read:</p>
<p>''No matter how long it takes, save us.''</p>
<p>Chris exhaled.</p>

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 2482</p>
<p>“So where are ya heading?” Jim asked, his turning down the secluded dirt road. It was his favorite spot for murdering thus far. Granted, it may have also been his only one thus far...</p>
<p>The woman had hardly said a word since he picked her up. She seemed bored, constantly staring out of her passenger window. It was all wrong. He liked to get them comfortable before doing the deed.</p>
<p>“Just the bus station,” she said.</p>
<p>“Really?” Jim raised an eyebrow. “What’s a pretty little miss like you needing to ride a gross bus for?”</p>
<p>“My mother’s in the hospital.”</p>
<p><em>Shit</em>, he thought. <em>It’s okay. Deep breaths, you can fix this.</em></p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Jim said with faux concern. He checked his gas light. The red light had flashed long enough. Just a little bit more…</p>
<p>Like an answer to his prayers, the truck began to sputter. It shook, the arrow on the speedometer slowly descending to zero. He frowned, hoping the woman wouldn’t see glee behind his mask. He didn't want to make her nervous. </p>
<p>“Dammit,” Jim barked as he banged on the steering wheel. “I’m out of gas. We’ll have to pull over.”</p>
<p>The woman shrugged, silent as ever. Something about her gesture made Jim nervous. He had never seen a hitchhiker look so indifferent. Yet, he liked it. She was his first true challenge.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jean stood to the side as Jim fiddled with the oil pan of his car.</p>
<p><em>He really is a moron, isn’t he? People are usually a little suspicious of hitchhikers but he’s treating me like a long lost friend. Shame, since I’ll be slitting his throat any moment now.</em></p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Jim called, breaking her thoughts.</p>
<p>Jean blinked, turning in his direction. The man had a goofy grin as he looked back at her, a streak of grease on his cheek. <em>A true idiot</em></p>
<p>“What?” she asked, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>“Well, I was wondering if you could give me a little help over here. It’s a tad complicated.”</p>
<p>“Putting gas in your car is complicated?”</p>
<p>“I never said I was a mechanic”</p>
<p>Jean sighed, walking over to help the dimwitted man. The closer she got, the more she noticed something… <em>off</em> about him. His demeanor, the way he hid a hand behind his back. She had practiced the same thing a thousand times before. It was a ploy - a bad one at that.</p>
<p>“What the fuck?” Jean furrowed her brow, backing away. “You have a knife, too?”</p>
<p>“What?” Jim began to sweat profusely. He wiped his forehead, revealing the gleam of a butcher’s cleaver in his closed fist. “Ah shit, wrong hand. But it's not what it looks like. I just keep this to check the fuselage and… wait, did you say ‘too’?”</p>
<p>Jean reddened, pulling her jacket closer to her body. The chilling sensation of the blade's flat side brushed against her side. So much for keeping her weapon a secret.</p>
<p>“Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t,” she started. “What’s it to you?”</p>
<p>Jim smiled, still cheery but different. Somehow more pleasant.</p>
<p>“You’re the Hitchhiking Murderer!” he said. “I’ve heard about you while watching TV. I must say, I’m a fan of your work.”</p>
<p>Jean stood flustered. “I… uh, thank you?”</p>
<p>“Jim Miller,” the man extended his hand. “I’m still new to the scene but I guess you could say I’m your opposite. I like to kill hitchhikers, rather than be one. I'll tell you, I never thought we’d cross paths this way. You’re even more beautiful than the rough sketches of you on the ten o'clock news.”</p>
<p>Jean blushed. <em>He can’t be serious.</em></p>
<p>“Thanks,” she paused. “So, are you not going to try and kill me?”</p>
<p>Jim shrugged. “I guess not. We don’t have to compete in the same pool for our victims so there’s no need to be territorial, right?”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>“So it’s settled.” Jim smiled. “We’re cool.”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Jean backed away, her eyes still glued to Jim's knife. He appeared friendly but if she learned anything, it was she couldn’t take chances. Yet, something told her he would stick to his word. He may have been a killer, but he was the earnest type.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she said, standing on the edge of the forest. Her voice echoed in the brisk night air as Jim perked his head up in anticipation of her words. “Next time, don’t make it so obvious that you’ll run out of gas. I could see you glancing at the meter every few seconds. And for the love of Christ, don’t show your knife until you’re about to kill someone. It's reeks of amateurishness. Don't give a bad name for the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Jim nodded, giving her a thumbs up. “You got it! Maybe one day, I’ll show you how much I’ve improved. I'll earn my name as an established serial killer and make you proud.”</p>
<p>Jean fought back smiling herself. <em>Stupid as ever</em></p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said, melting into the safety of the foliage. “Maybe one day.” </p>

<h4>[WP] Elon Musk is actually a stranded alien who needs humanity to develop interstellar travel to get home</h4>
<p>Score: 2208</p>
<p>"Mr. Musk?" Francis knocked cautiously at the office door.</p>
<p>"Come In Francis. Tell me everything, how did it go? Was the landing successful?" Elon asked rising from his black leather chair. </p>
<p>"Un..unfortunately sir while the rocket did indeed land back on the barge it was unable to stabilize itself. It..it was a total loss. The maneuvering system is just not capable yet…But we have already started to re-code the core and re-engineer the thruster output." Francis trailed off as he noticed the defeat cloud his bosses face. The CEO turned to the window. </p>
<p>"Thank you Francis…it is not your fault. I will check in with our RD department shortly. Take the rest of the day off, Im sure you need it." </p>
<p>"Yes sir." Said Francis turning to go. "And sir, don't worry we're way ahead of everyone else. We'll figure it out... we'll get you home. We've got plenty of time." With that Francis began to walk out of the office. </p>
<p>"I wish you were right." Said Elon, stopping Francis in his tracks. "Sir?" </p>
<p>"Close the door, and sit down." Francis did as he was told, but the tone of Elon's voice made his blood run cold. </p>
<p>"I never thought I would come to respect a human as much as I do you. Which in a way makes my shame in deceiving you even deeper. He took a deep breath and continued. " I am an advance scout, not a wayward alien. My home world has died, sucked dry of resources and life to support my civilization. Those of my people who survived the fall set to the stars to find a new home. Our scouts went far and wide but the news was never good. Until finally we spotted your small backwater planet. Hope was renewed ten fold and we rejoiced in our salvation. I was sent ahead to prepare this Earth for our arrival. But upon my arrival hope turned to ash. My crash landing in Roswell destroyed my ship and my only means of communication. My only way to warn my people.." He trailed off.</p>
<p>"Warn them? Warn them of what, of us?" Francis was struggling to understand. </p>
<p>"No." Said Elon. "To warn them that by the time they arrive this planet will have died as well."</p>

<p>When I turned 15, I was sent to the Sun Edge. I had grown up on the streets of Harka, learning no skill or trade. We couldn't afford the apprenticeship fees. My father had no lands to pass on to me, and all other good farms between there and the Star Edge had been claimed. So on Appraisal Day, there was nowhere else for me to go.</p>
<p>I was given a plot of land to work, only about two meters wide at the beginning. "It'll grow as the Edge advances," they said. The soldiers dropped me at the property line with a gaunt horse and some meager tools. They told me that I could have as much land as I could plow in the North-South direction by the time they returned to the Edge with another resettled orphan. At which point <em>he</em> would start plowing where I'd reached, and the cycle would begin all over again. </p>
<p>I'm a city boy. I grew up amongst the trader's tents and the craftsmen's workshops. They'd hired me for every type of menial seasonal job: splitting wood, working bellows, carving out rotted parts of vegetables to make them look fresh... I even helped with the Migration once when the Star Edge got too close to the settlement. We'd loaded up carts with all of the shops and dragged them across the plains until we could see the Sun Edge, and then plopped it all down and set it up again. All of these jobs for a few coins, and the only one I'd never actually done was plow anything. Needless to say, I wasn't making very good headway. </p>
<p>The metal plow fought me every step of the way, snagging on stubborn roots and buried rocks. And when I <em>could</em> find some clear ground, then the damned horse would decide that it didn't want to move! </p>
<p><strong>CLUNK</strong>. The plow ran into something again. But it wasn't the normal dull thud that the rocks made. It was a sharp clang, like the sound of a blacksmith's hammering on stout armor. Maybe another tool? Had some other poor settler been here before me and died with his plow in hand? I had been in the marketplace long enough to know that even salvaged instruments could fetch a hefty price, maybe even more than whatever pitiful crop I could scrape from the land. Mines were easy enough to dig, but could only last so long before the Star Edge would approach, and they had to be abandoned.</p>
<p>I dug it out. A long, thin tube made of pure metal, but rusted and caked in dirt. Skeletal hands clutched the grooved grip, and I soon uncovered the rest of the body. There were holes in the metal armor, and the skull had been caved in, but it didn't look like the wound from an ax or a hammer. Around the body, I found unusual metal pellets and a strange powder mixed into the soil. Where had it come from? What war had this man died in? I was only a meter away from the Sun Edge, and anything out there would be fried to a crisp after only a minute or two. No way that someone could have gone out long enough. And I'd never seen anything like this, so it certainly couldn't be from the last Rotation. Back then we had barely mastered metalworking!</p>
<p>From a distance, I heard a horse's whinny. The soldiers were returning with the next orphan to be resettled. I'd made barely any progress on the field; definitely not enough to support a family. I quickly covered up the body and the metal tube and went back to my work. The horse was finally willing to cooperate, and we managed to plow another hundred meters or so before the soldiers arrived with the next settler. I greeted them calmly, and they spit back in my face. Such chivalrous gentlemen. My new neighbor introduced himself: Gerome, another city boy like myself. "Watch for stones," I warned him, wishing him luck in his plowing. The soldiers laughed at our shared misfortune and headed back to the city for the next boy.</p>
<p>I watched them leave, then returned to that spot. There was something important about this device, and I didn't want the soldiers to know about it. I had to resolve this mystery for myself.</p>

<p>In Their ever-growing glory, Those Who Walk Before Us have left another great monument to encourage us on our journey. A great and noble tower, bleached a pure white by the Star, showing Their own passage through this land. Our scouts first spotted it three moons ago, and guided us to it. We know now that we still march on to Salvation, guided by Their ever-present markers. And we have done our part to guide Those Who Walk Behind Us, adding another tier to Their great tower, an inspiration to Those who follow the frozen tundra we leave behind. We will do well to rest here. Our scouts say that the desert is not so distant now, and that we should not expect another oasis to emerge from it for many moons. </p>
<p>But I am not entirely at rest. We found a smaller monument as well, but it is unlike any that we have seen. It does not depict the great endless plain on which we walk, as all the others do. Instead, it contains a foreign script, and unfamiliar shapes with lines connecting them. It has caused a disturbance among our peoples. Most believe that it was merely a new practice by Those Who Walk Before Us, but there are some who are denouncing it as evil, a work of the darkness that follows behind us. And there are some who say that it bears a message. A message of what, we cannot discern. Myself, I do not know what to believe. I would rather avoid it entirely, but it has become too prominent in my people’s minds to ignore.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm planning on writing a couple parts from both perspectives, but this is all I have time for now. Will add more soon!</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> First of all, thank you for the gold, friend! And thank you all for your support and encouragement.

<p>My plane is delayed. Don't you hate it when that happens? </p>
<p>It is some sort of mechanical failure, the pilots say. You'd think that the Prime Minister's plane would be maintained in immaculate condition, wouldn't you? They shouldn't be discovering these things right as I'm jetting off to the EU summit with the Russian Federation concerning the state of Crimea. The UN-administered regime of independence for the region has been an utter failure. Instead of creating a stable buffer between Europe and Russia, it's only led to civil warfare. But I'm pushing to end it once and for all.</p>
<p>I've been on the front lines of this conflict, both as a platoon leader during Britain's first intervention in 2051, and as a politician in Parliament urging for greater action against the Russian-backed rebels. I railed against our former Prime Minister's weak response, as well as the pitiful attempts of the EU Expeditionary force. And I did such a good job of it that my own Independence Party won a majority in Parliament only this past year. And, using my newfound political clout, I was able to convince our Russian counterparts to join us for a peace meeting in Tel Aviv. Israel has done a fine job of staying neutral despite sharing a border with the EU's Turkish territory.</p>
<p>After an hour on the tarmac, my plane is finally able to take off. We soon reach a cruising altitude, and I check my watch. The EU President and Foreign Minister should have landed already with their gaggle of Presidents and Prime Ministers in tow. They'll be whisked away to the summit without even checking into the hotel. The limousines will arrive at roughly 2:30, and the bombs are set to detonate at 2:45 in the midst of the scheduled press conference kicking off the summit. Russia's counterpart will also be <em>conveniently</em> delayed, sparing them from the carnage as well. Naturally this fact will be held up later as proof of their guilt.</p>
<p>Oh, did I not mention that I'm the reason the plane had mechanical problems? That it's all a deliberate ruse to make it look like I should have been a victim (to gain sympathy in the press) while simultaneously ridding me of those ninnies from the peace bloc who'd prefer to work things out with words? That it will soon be revealed that Russian operatives were the culprits of the bombing? It's the perfect Casus Belli.</p>
<p>We've barely made it over the Channel, and I'm already bored. God, I hate flying. My foot taps the plush carpet impatiently, waiting for the news. It's 2:46 already. What's taking so long? I pull out my notepad, ready to get to work. Even though I can't be seen preparing my speech before I've even received news of the 'tragedy,' there's nobody else in the plane. The pilots won't know what I'm working on here, so they won't be suspicious. And I do want to get a jump on it. After all, it needs to be convincing enough to make the right case. That this tragedy cannot go unanswered, and that I am the man to lead the EU to victory. I'm the only one with the political clout, the military experience, and most importantly: the resolve to see it through. Perhaps I ought to channel Churchill. </p>
<p>Just as I put pen to paper, the copilot raps on the door. "Prime Minister? There's some news you need to hear."</p>

<p>President Pushkin hung his head in his hands as Commander in Chief Qin personally led the Chinese land forces into Red Square.  The entire month of February had been an endless series of frustrations, as nothing could stop the 100 million man army inevitably marching through Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, and Kazan.  Birth rates had plummeted for the better part of the century throughout Russia, and no amount of technology, armaments, or diplomacy could stop such a throng of people.  </p>
<p>His country had been through a lot over the centuries, but there was a bitter sting of shame in knowing that Qin was about to achieve what so many had failed on his watch. Pushkin looked out onto the square, and dejectedly slugged what was left of his vodka.</p>

A land victory in the winter would have been impossible with the temperature so cold, so I used both of those campaigns to accelerate global warming as much as I could."  </p>
<p>"My Napoleon campaign advanced the development of nation states, and indirectly led to the Industrial Revolution.  My Hitler campaign rapidly accelerated technological development on all sides.

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 281</p>
<p>The hitchhiker's targets were fairly specific, or at least he liked certain kinds of people. People who had kids, the more the better. People who were bastions of their community. Those kind hearted souls that everyone tended to love and miss. He loved knowing they would never find them again. He loved the searches and the tears and the heartbreak knowing children would grow up without a father or a mother, that a community lost someone they truly adored. Then, sometimes, he had to settle. Today was one of those days.</p>
<p>The man is oldish. He mentions that his kids are well into their 30s. His wife died years ago, and he is kind of a loner. It'll be an easy disappointing kill. He can at least get some pleasure at seeing how far he'll take him. Sometimes, people take him all the way to the cabin. They make it too easy. </p>
<p>"Hey, stranger, can you open my glove box and hand me those needles? I need some insulin."</p>
<p>The hitchhiker does. This is all too easy. The man stares at the road and fumbles with the box.</p>
<p>"Can you hold the wheel? This will only take a second."</p>
<p>The hitchhiker does. The driver fills up his syringe and pulls up his shirt. The hitchhiker looks back at the road and feels something in his neck. He pulls back and looks at him. </p>
<p>"Sorry, that's a sedative. I always forget what it's called. I mix it with a horse tranquilizer. It knocks people out pretty quick." </p>
<p>The hitchhiker leans towards the driver, but slumps in his seat, asleep. </p>
<p>When he wakes up, he's tied to a chair.</p>
<p>"Well, a man after my own heart, quite literally. I've ran into one of your kind before. I feel bad about it. It's like destroying the Mona Lisa or something, but it has to be done. Based on your gear, I thought you'd be more careful. People are foolish, but you are sloppy. This was way too easy. Your methods too. What was the plan? Drug me with morphine? Sloppy, oh so sloppy."</p>
<p>"Just let me go, sir."</p>
<p>"Respect, that's a new one. You must actually be afraid. You should be. Do you know how I started doing this?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Do you know how I started? I've only been taking care of hitchhikers for about a decade."</p>
<p>"H-how?"</p>
<p>"Well, I had a wonderful son who went missing one day. It was uncharacteristic of him because he was a loving devoted father. He was on his way to Missoula. I looked into it. There were quite a few missing person reports who were last seen on their way to places in this region. Now, that's strange. People crash and go missing all the time, but I talked to the families. Most of these missing people had a propensity for picking up hitchhikers."</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything to your son."</p>
<p>"Please, we are better than lies. That's what the last one like you said too. He was right, by the way. So, I kept looking. When I started, I kidnapped these people. Not all of them. Some of them I let go, but anyone suspicious I had to know. I felt like I was doing the world a favor too by killing these people, these criminals. It's amazing how easy it to justify it. Really, they didn't deserve to live and neither do you."</p>
<p>"Just let me go. I won't tell anyone."</p>
<p>"Please, three syringes with enough drugs to knock out an elephant? You're not a normal user. No track marks, anywhere. Three knives on your body? You can't always wait, can you? I understand, there is a perverse satisfaction in it."</p>
<p>"Shit, man, we could work together. We could ravage the countryside."</p>
<p>"There it is, a confession of sorts. No, you're my last. There have only been six for me. How about for you?"</p>
<p>"I stopped counting after 50." He says with a smile. </p>
<p>The hitchhiker's death is nothing special. The driver slices his throat and lets him bleed out. He dumps his body by the side of the road. His victims will likely find some justice. He leaves his bag with him. Hopefully, the cops will ask the right questions, and his son will be found, and his family will finally know what happened to him. That's what he hopes anyway.     </p>

<h4>[WP] A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rouge planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".</h4>
<p>Score: 212</p>
<p>The words, etched onto my arm like a brand, were so raw in meaning that I thought I had understood them. 
Oh how wrong I was...</p>
<p>We had seen it coming for decades - a collision with a transient planet crossing our solar plane - and prepared adequately; <em>most</em> of the populace had moved to the predicted opposite side of the planet, into state-of-the-art bunkers equipped to last 30, maybe 40 years at most. Some of us were left behind - the ones who had accepted their fates, the ones who denied theirs also - and we had collated in locations around the globe to watch it all unfold.</p>
<p>I was at Stonehenge, waiting for the start up of the 24-hour countdown clock with those of us who had remained in England. Why Stonehenge you ask? I haven't a clue - I never researched what it truly was - but it was voted for, and as such it became our location.
<em>click</em>
I heard the switch fly for the clock to start, but as the first few pixels lit up, everything stopped; people's bodies petrified, true emotion captured in facial expressions across the board, but not one meager atom moved anymore. I could still move though, as if unaffected by what had happened...</p>
<p>Scarcely 10 minutes later (or so it felt, considering the apparent universal standstill in effect) I felt my left arm go numb - as though I had been paralysed - as letters were carved into it by a mysterious source; <em>"However long it takes, save us"</em> they read, as if I had been chosen to be some kind of saviour. Me, a small suburban code monkey working on simple AI, a saviour? Ludicrous.</p>
<p>The next revelation of mine, I would guess it was around 20 minutes after that, was that I could not leave the boundaries of Stonehenge; I had to save whoever "us" referred to from within this tiny area. I won't lie; it was a useful thing to learn considering the vastness of the universe and however many sentient beings there may be that need saving, and so knowing that whoever needed ME specifically knew they could be saved by something here helped narrow down the requirements a little.</p>
<p>Of course, half an hour of light poking around doesn't expose much information, so I went deeper - so to speak - and began to look at each individual person, filtering through their belongings to glean what I could from any identification or item they had on them. Nothing stood out until the eighth person; I lifted a scrap of linen from her pocket with a red-stained symbol on it, reminiscent of one I'd seen earlier tattooed onto the third person (who was carrying a serrated-blade flick knife in their back pocket - perhaps the source of the writing on my arm), and that I had seen on the central stone.</p>
<p>Things fell into place rapidly - these people, with their runes and their knife, must have slipped me out of "their" time into a fixed point where I could search for a way to save them that they may not have thought of. I, of course, had no idea what the rest of it meant however - in my mind, and so I followed my gut; taking the knife I had found earlier, I put a drop of blood onto each of the runes on the central stone in order to save these people. Nothing happened, not instantly, not for the ten (maybe 20?) years I waited for it to happen: Time was still frozen.</p>
<p>I tried everything, but I couldn't even free myself from this time-lock by killing the people who I assumed put me there - the knife wouldn't touch them - and I couldn't leave Stonehenge. The words, etched onto my arm like a brand, were so raw in meaning that I thought I had understood them, I should have been free by now.</p>
<p>Then, in my madness, it clicked like the switch to start the clock. They always intended to die in the planetary collision, but they had left me behind at this point in time to save them, or rather, their memories. An unfaltering image of them in their life, "alive" in a sense of not being dead, with an undying observer to see that they are in fact alive.</p>
<p>"However long it takes" was a white lie. They had never meant for me to work out that there's nothing that can be done. I'm stuck here for eternity, keeping their image alive in my thoughts, "saving them" from death.</p>
<p>Edit: Was missing a letter.</p>

<h4>[WP] Elon Musk is actually a stranded alien who needs humanity to develop interstellar travel to get home</h4>
<p>Score: 166</p>
<p>From the Desk of Elon Musk:</p>
<p>I’m not sure why I am even addressing the audacious, ludicrous concerns that have been plaguing me of late, the belief that I am some sort of “stranded alien” trying to get home. Such accusations, such outrageous statements have no place in the media. They should exist only in fairy tales, in fiction novels and the land of make-believe. To even have to sit down at my computer and type out an explanation as to how I am not, in fact, a stranded alien attempting to utilize Earth’s technology to create interstellar travel and return home is absolutely insane. Yet here I am, sitting at my computer and typing away.</p>
<p>I want to begin by making it absolutely, abundantly clear that I am not, in any way whatsoever, a “stranded alien.” First and foremost, those that saw the photograph of “me without skin,” that was simply a picture taken after a particularly intense massage that happened to leave me looking green and scaly. I assure you that I fired that masseuse.  I mean, look at me: I’m just a typical human being, not an alien in a costume. Sure, I might have a slightly higher level of intelligence than your run-of-the-mill Earthling, but does that really make me an alien? Does having the ability to create profitable companies and revolutionary technologies make me any less human? I don’t think so, I don’t believe that is how things work. I mean, I’ve grown up on this planet; I’ve lived my entire life on this planet. I am, for all intents and purposes, a Earthling. This is my home, I am definitely not stranded, and even less so banished. I have no intention of leaving here for some ridiculous land of make believe, such as the planet Vergaeon X in the Andromeda galaxy. To make that claim would be simple insanity.</p>
<p>That said, the rumors of my foray into interstellar travel are true; I have indeed been looking into the possibilities of harnessing Earth’s energy for galactic travel. There’s nothing wrong with that, though. It’s not like my actions would result in the destruction of all living things. That’s hardly the case. In fact, I’d go so far as to say it probably isn’t the case at all maybe. Regardless, though, what does it matter? Who isn’t researching interstellar travel these days? I mean, and this is going to be largely anecdotal, just last week I saw a child at a science fair present a diorama displaying an interstellar space ship from the show <em>Star Trek</em>. Was that youth’s humanity brought into question? No, absolutely not. He was simply accepted as a human, seen the same as his peers. Yet here I am, sitting at a computer and trying to argue against the insane statement that I am not human. Instead, I am forced to explain beyond a shadow of a doubt that I have no intention of sacrificing the Earth and all of its inhabitants so I can return to a planet that I once called home.</p>
<p>In regards to my interstellar travel research, I’d like to further clear up the misconception that it is an attempt to get home. That is absolutely, 100%, not the case at all. As I’ve already established, I am home. Earth is my home. Furthermore, my research is absolutely not inspired by a burning desire to return to a planet that had forsaken me, to look my father in the eyes and laugh as he and his allies burn. That is not who I am; I am not an inter-galactic terrorist responsible for heinous acts on Vergaeon X. I am just an inventor, a billionaire, and a role model. I only want to enhance the lives of humanity, to make space travel a regular occurrence, not figure out a way to sacrifice Earth’s primitive technology to return to some “planet” that may or may not exist. </p>
<p>Now, I’d like to quickly address a concern that I feel might arise from my last paragraph: I am not, in any way, an intergalactic space terrorist banished to Earth following the death of millions in a war for profit. In no way, shape, or form did I attempt to overthrow the leadership on Vergaeon X and amass an army of cyborgs—whom were shaped very similarly to my beloved “Tesla” vehicle. That is simply insane, an outrageous accusation that has no place within intelligent culture. To even assume that I am attempting to recreate that army here on Earth, first by developing the evil that is PayPal to fund my acts, and then working toward luring you into a false sense of security with the widespread acceptance of the Tesla, that is insane. They are cars and are absolutely not sentient, nor lying dormant and awaiting my command. In fact, don’t even think about that anymore. It’s so crazy that it doesn’t merit any thoughts whatsoever. Just forget I even mentioned it.</p>
<p>So, with that, I’d like to conclude by thanking all of my supporters. Those who have stood by me during these insane allegations, those who defended me when I was “photographed” without my skin, those who denied the ludicrous claims that Teslas were beginning to make their own decisions. That is not how reality works; I am not stealing your money to amass an army of cyborgs and create a technology that would utterly demolish humanity and the land on which it lives, a technology that would be incredibly beneficial for righting the wrongs that have been done to me on a distant world. That is simply fiction. The reality is that I am a human, just a simple man trying to make the world a better place. That’s it. </p>

<p>So I looked at the big ball of rouge in the sky, and developed a plan.</p>
<p>Over the next several months, I found every extension ladder I could lay my hands on.  Traveling to every hardware store in a region, I loaded them up into the trailer of a semi.</p>
<p>Once I had collected 9,972 extension ladders, averaging about 30 feet each, until they bridged the approximately 50 mile gap between planets.</p>
<p>Anyway, blah blah blah long story short, I spent an eternity brushing away rouge on the planet and rouging up the faces of Earth's entire population until the rouge-planet was completely consumed.</p>

<p>I stand in awe as the burliest of our people roll the Great Stone forward. A man only witnesses this event once or twice in his life, maybe three times if he’s lucky. They meticulously edge the sculpture into the perfect spot, then some of them begin heaving with all their might to hold it up while the others slide the logs out from underneath. They lower it to the ground as carefully as they can, then stand back to join the rest of us spectators basking in its glory.</p>
<p>Crafted by our ancestors countless generations ago, the Great Stone is the center of our tribe. It is where we worship the magnificent Sun, and it is the channel through which the Sun in return guides us, telling us when next to move on. At the top of the elaborate carved structure is a thick hole, too thick to let any light through from directly above. But when our provider above moves low enough in the sky, a shaft of light finds the right angle through the hole, and the resulting beam of brilliance cutting through the Stone’s shadow tells us it is time to pack up and follow.</p>
<p>Our initial worship complete, we all spread to begin the busywork of preparing what will be our home for the next couple of decades. A few large, simple shelters have already been constructed around the new Stonespot. But there is much more to be done. </p>
<p>I look at the small sack of seeds in my hand, then up at the landscape around me. There is a good, sizable clearing behind one of the shelters. I stride over and waste no time getting on my knees and tilling the rough earth with my calloused hands. We will need these crops before our current, limited rations from our previous home run out. Especially since the animals usually take longer to migrate and give us something to hunt.</p>
<p>My hand finds a large rock a few inches below the surface, and I grab it to pull it out of the way. But to my surprise it won’t budge in the slightest. After redoubling my efforts to no avail, I begin to dig the surrounding dirt away from the rock. Several minutes of work later I have uncovered what appears to be the corner of a large, rectangular slab of rock with etchings on it. A… skull? And some line segments surrounding it?</p>
<p>After much more digging, I have freed the entire slab, three fingers thick and larger in width and length than my torso. Laying it flat, I look down at the etchings. There is indeed a skull in the upper left corner, with a ghastly and menacing expression, and rays protruding from it all around. Below and to the right are several figures fleeing, except one larger more heroic-seeming figure facing back toward the threat in the sky defiantly and brandishing a weapon of some sort.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire drawing as a whole, it seems clear that the entity in the sky is supposed to be the Sun. But it was unfathomable heresy to depict it in such a cruel fashion. And who would flee from that which grants life? Who would wish to fight it? I must show this to the chief at once. But wait…</p>
<p>There is something else in the soil. I set to work digging yet again, uncovering a brownish long object. As I grab it, it crumbles apart in my hand. Resolving to be more careful, I search the surrounding soil and find more such objects. I soon realize they are bones. How long had they been in the earth to be so frail? But no matter. These must be the heretics who spurned the great Sun. It seems they paid the price. I smile, my faith in our provider stronger than ever, as I wander back toward the Stone to tell the chief of my findings.</p>

<p>It took me a while. Ha, maybe I'm understating it. Four million twenty six thousand and 3 days. Eleven thousand and thirty years. Fuck. What would happen when I finished? I looked up at the behemoth structure I had built, admiring my audacity. Like a giant fly swatter, it stood. Facing the sun that never fell, carrying with it the hopes and dreams of a time ravaged mind.</p>
<p>The first few years had been fun. Time had frozen a day before the meteor was predicted to strike. People took the news better than I had expected, only a few looters, most people went along with their lives as if nothing was happening. Sometimes it can be hard to upset the status quo. With a message of hope riding on my arms, I flew free. Running around town, enjoying the finer things in life. I ate at every fine restaurant in New York for three months. All the food had been frozen at the right temperature, so succulent, so perfect. I used to like food.</p>
<p>The first millenia I- I don't recall. A thousand years of life, and I don't even remember. Most of it was probably spent in panic. I think it took me decades to find the spectroscopic analysis of the ball. Talcum powder. The same shit used in rouge. Fucking dry wall was going to end the world. I doubt the TV coverage mentioned that information....</p>
<p>The second and third millenia were perhaps my most productive. I built probably a dozen massive projects, all aimed at blowing the damn thing apart. None of them ever launched. Time just kept.... timing.</p>
<p>Eventually I went mad. London doesn't exist anymore. I called myself god and smote the wicked. London bridge fell. </p>
<p>Eventually I turned to Bhuddism. I meditated everywhere, even under a bodhi tree. For a while I found enlightenment. Unfortunately the enlightened mind wasn't made to last forever. </p>
<p>Five thousand years ago I rediscovered my task. I built the world a giant net. My goal was to blast through the talcum, dispersing it into a fine cloud. I had built a fleet of ships, all designed to collect the talc, clean our environment of the inevitable fallout. This would work I told myself. This was the end.</p>

<p>The good news is I couldn't die, I wasn't aging, I didn't need to sleep, eat, or drink, and my body didn't produce waste.<br />
The bad news is it had been a solid ten years - I think? - and I was no closer to finding a fast way to stop the damn planet.<br />
It had started back in 2023, when NASA announced that they had detected a rogue planet about the size of Mercury flying toward the solar system. Then in 2024 they announced that it would fly  really close to Earth, about ten lunar distances away. Which was going to be super cool. If you were into astronomy, you'd get some awesome views. If you weren't, one, what's wrong with you, and two, there'd be some awesome waves for surfing. Then things went horribly wrong.<br />
There's an old story about Halley's Comet. When Halley figured out the comet's orbit in 1705, he predicted it would come back in 1758. But he was off by a few months because he didn't correctly account for gravitational interaction with Jupiter.<br />
There's also a saying that those who don't study history are doomed to repeat it.<br />
Whoops.<br />
Early 2025 rolled around. The planet flew by Jupiter, got nudged in orbit a little bit, and Earth collectively started to panic. All the space agencies now were in agreement on its path, and there were no more major objects that could disrupt its orbit. It was on a dead-on collision course with Earth.<br />
Eventually the planet got close enough that we could see it at night, and then in the day. Humans being human, there were actually countdowns on the internet counting down to the second of impact. The countdown was down to about twelve hours when suddenly it froze. As did everyone in the room with me. I looked outside. Yup, everyone was frozen out there too. I looked up. The planet wasn't moving, which was nice. But why could I still move? That's when I felt the pain on my arm. I looked down and saw that letters were being written on me. "S..A..V..E....U..S..."<br />
Well, balls.<br />
So now I have to find a way to stop a planet from crashing into Earth. The good news is I have plenty of time. Course, I have no idea how to do it.<br />
I honestly don't know how this time freezing thing is working, because it seems like only half of time has stopped. I mean, I can still see things, and if I speak I can hear myself. If I throw something, it flies like normal, but if I bump into a person they stay frozen, even in physically impossible positions. Chemical reactions still work but the internet doesn't. Electricity in general works though, and things don't seem to lose power. It's all weird and basically I'm stuck using books to get an idea of how to stop this thing.<br />
So far my best idea is to build a rocket to get up to the planet. I found one that NASA had apparently been planning to use for something, until their efforts got refocused on brainstorming ways to stop the Earth from getting destroyed. Once I get up there though, that's when the real fun begins. The planet is about the size of Mercury, so I'm guessing the escape velocity is about the same. If that's true, I could get individual rocks away from it just by throwing them really hard. Since gravity evidently isn't working on a large scale - one, the planet isn't moving toward Earth, two, Earth isn't moving toward the sun, and three, none of the other planets seem to have moved - if I throw a rock from the planet toward the sun, it'll get there without having to deal with escaping Earth's gravity well.<br />
Resigning myself to many lifetimes of labor, I've loaded the rocket with a few thousand pickaxes. I'm leaving in about six hours. And hey, in a few thousand years I'll be able to say that I'm the only person to have completely dismantled a planet.</p>

<p>The young Caliph sat in his tower, surveying his kingdom stretching well beyond the horizon in every direction. It had been considered impossible, what he had done to bring the entire Islamic nation together. Powerful men had tried to unify the chosen for thousands of years, only to be corrupted by their own unworthiness, often seeking power for its own sake and private purposes. Oroitz succeeded where others had failed. That he was a European made the feat an impossible miracle, praise be to Allah. Bringing Mohammad's followers together had been the Caliph's sole purpose ever since anyone would listen during his charismatic, self-righteous youth. But that was not his final goal.</p>
<p>Now it was time to bring the other peoples into the grace of God, and the lands north of his seemed to be the proper candidates. Theirs was a nation of lost souls, literally, metaphorically and politically. The people yet lived in squalor and fear under the heel of bloodthirsty oligarchs, the wretched having nothing to believe in to give them hope. The Caliph could not, would not fail at saving them. </p>
<p>So it was said.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The well-beaten prisoner was dragged in to the Caliph's chambers in shackles. It had been a trivial matter to kidnap the officer from his family’s home in St. Petersburg. He was a promising soldier and politician, but not a well-protected one. His handlers dropped him roughly on the stone floor, and left the room reluctantly as the Caliph bid.</p>
<p>“I was not as smart as I thought, you know,” Oroitz finally stated. The prisoner looked up in surprise.</p>
<p>“I have no idea why I’m here…” the soldier rasped. If his jailor heard him, he didn’t give any indication of it.</p>
<p>“My second time around, I assumed my memories were a fantastical dream,” the Caliph continued, “After all, who, but crackpots and mystics would believe that you could remember the actions of your past lives?” The captive looked up in surprise. The young Caliph smirked. “I would have certainly been mocked to say I retained the experiences of Napoleon Bonaparte! But then I came to decide that the memories were a boon from beyond our world, a gift so that I could learn from prior mistakes. It had to be the natural order of things that I should make the world one. So, blitzkrieg across the Eastern front my armies did. What a shock and despair it was to be defeated so relentlessly once again!” The caliph was spitting out the words at this point. The prisoner’s face had calmed. The Caliph stilled in response. 
“When I awoke this time in this world, with two lives already crammed in me, I knew my memories were real. I was Emporer! I was Fuhrer! I am Caliph!</p>
<p>“I knew I could lead people easily, angry ones who felt wronged and needed redemption. So as before, I invited the willing populaces to take control of their lives; they followed me easily enough. But I still wanted that which had been denied to me before.” The caliph peered into the eyes of the fallen man. His eyes were ageless, but the officer’s face was stoic. </p>
<p>“I don’t know why you are telling me this!” the prisoner muttered, “Send me away. You are insane!”</p>
<p>“Oh, we won’t be doing that!” the Caliph laughed, “You see, I’m not so stupid anymore. In the end, I’ve realized I don’t have a unique gift. I’m not that special. I’m not even smart as you, I know…” The beaten man’s face watched him less steadily. “There are others who remember, I finally realized. It’s not a gift. It’s simply just the way some of us are.” The Caliph edged his face closer to his onlooker. “Your name, Bronislav, isn’t it? Quite appropriate I think. Protector of the glory, did you choose it yourself?” The man said nothing. The young ruler watched for admission, “However, I think I preferred it when you called yourself Stalin, more so when you went by Alexander.” The Caliph stood triumphantly.</p>
<p>Bronislav Osinov finally let his despair show. <em>The Caliph knew.</em> “You’ve won,” he wept. “Just kill me and be done with it.”</p>
<p>“And let you be reborn free to come back and beat me another time?” the Caliph predicted. “I can’t beat you in a war and I know it. No, no, you will live a long time my friend.... There will come a winter when I will take Russia.” </p>
<p>Bronislav glowered with impotent rage. </p>
<p>Caliph Oroitz, the false prophet, sighed with pleasure.</p>
<p>“and this time you will only get to watch…”</p>

<p>As every pair of eyes in the entirety of White Center High School's  gymnasium turned to face Jacob, the slightly chubby and <em>very</em> nervous boy wished he could melt through the floor. Students packed the gym, each seat on the bleachers being used, each plastic chair on the court taken. Jacob stood alone on the uplifted stage, looking out at the sea of people.  </p>
<p>"You what, now?" A voice came from the bleachers.  </p>
<p>Jacob cleared his throat, trying to steady his hand. "Well, it's just a theory."  </p>
<p>When no one spoke out, he decided to continue.  </p>
<p>"You see," he went on with false confidence, "Elon Musk is trying to share information about the rocket technology between different... er, creators of rockets. Why would anyone do that? It isn't profitable."  </p>
<p>A few nods came from a few seats.  </p>
<p>"Profit, that is the driving force behind all entrepreneurs and Elon Musk is certainly an entrepreneur. So why is he not interested in profit?" Jacob's voice was growing more calm as the links locked in his mind. He suddenly realized he was right to have requested a small speech during the monthly school meeting. "I should revise my last statement. Profit is the driving force behind all <em>human</em> entrepreneurs. I think, and stay with me here, that Elon Musk is not a human."  </p>
<p>"Go on..." a student in the front row said.  </p>
<p>He did go on. He told everyone of how Elon Musk had ideas no human ever had and how Elon Musk was <em>too</em> into space travel and how Elon Musk was really attract- luckily Jacob stopped himself before finished that last bit.  </p>
<p>The students roared their approval, shouting out things like: "Take me now, Jacob," and "I wish you were my father, Jacob!"  </p>
<p>Jacob was so elated with what had just occurred, that when school ended, he rushed home and went to Reddit, his favorite website. He quickly went to a specific subreddit: Getmotivated.  </p>
<p>He typed like he never typed before, putting letters on the screen with ferocious speed. He typed out his feelings at the time. The events that occurred. The changes in the once-thought-to-be permanently fixed social structure of White Center High.  </p>
<p>Then, exhausted, Jacob slept.  </p>
<p>He woke up two hours later and checked his post.  </p>

<p>Jacob blinked. The door to the computer room opened and Mark stood there. "Get off the computer, fag."  </p>
<p>Jacob shrugged off the defeat on Reddit and smiled at his brother. "No longer am I fag, I basically own the school after today."  </p>
<p>"What?" Mark stepped forward. "You were asleep all day long. You got up two hours ago, confirming you weren't in a coma, and used the computer for half an hour then went back to sleep."  </p>
<p>"But..." Jacob started, "but, the, but, at school-"  </p>
<p>"School was cancelled, now get off the computer, <em>fag</em>."  </p>

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 86</p>
<p>November 20, 2009</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
<p>I must detail a particularly odd, albeit fortunate occurrence that had befallen me recently. But first, I must mention this for the sake of clarity: I am a killer, and what's more, a <em>good</em> killer, one who takes pride in his work as a blacksmith might take pride in his sharpened blades. You, whoever you are that is reading this now, will neither know <em>which</em> killer I am, nor will you have enough information to figure that out; this I can tell you with certainty. As I said before, I am good at what I do.</p>
<p>With this in mind, know that I have encountered many victims throughout my years of work. And in those years, I've developed something of a skill to read emotions, vague ones, if nothing else. This in mind, some of my victims projected obvious facades of bravery and tenacity when entering my presence, as if I'd be foolish enough to fall for their game, as if I <em>couldn't tell</em>. And others couldn't help but broadcast the anxiety that raced onward behind their nervous and frantic eyes. Heed my words when I say this: their eyes betrayed them.</p>
<p>Those who broadcasted fear or false bravery were, I must admit, <em>extremely</em> fun to take advantage of. You will never know the satisfaction in breaking down one's pride and elucidating to them just how helpless they are, nor will you ever know the invigoration of arousing so much raw fear that your victim psychologically breaks down and begs and pleads so that you might spare their life. <em>Nothing</em> will ever make you feel more alive.</p>
<p>But yesterday I came upon a man who didn't fit the mold of a victim, no. Quite the contrary. I could tell the moment that I approached him with my vehicle that he was different, and different in a manner that I did not initially figure out. The very manner in which he stood and rocked to and fro was interesting and perhaps even captivating. </p>
<p>He stood out on a darkened road by himself and seemed to care little of his current predicament. And I knew then that I had to have him. I must admit that I was drawn to him, not in the sense that I was infatuated with him, but rather in the sense that I <em>needed</em> to figure him out so that psychologically breaking him before his untimely death would be that much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>I opened the door for him, and never once did my eyes divert from his as we spoke.</p>
<p>"Would you like a ride? You seem lost and it's terribly cold out here." He flashed a grin, and I doubt that he was aware that I saw it.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes please! Oh god, thank you so much for stopping for me. You have absolutely no idea how long I've been here, waiting, cold. I just, I just need something to eat man. Oh and your name? I'm Dale. Call me Dale." He extended a bony hand to shake mine but I did not reward his gesture. </p>
<p>"That greeting was extremely oversold," I said as he shut the door. Dale, if that was actually his name, responded with a quick and almost surprised glance out of the corner of his eye, though I pretended that I didn't see it. At this point in our encounter, I suspected that he knew what I was. </p>
<p>"I'm not sure I follow you, man. And don't you have a name? I told you mine, so in all fairness-"</p>
<p>"I stopped out of the goodness of my heart to ensure that you wouldn't freeze out here tonight, Dale. Know in consequence that my ultimate objective is ensuring your safety, and that you arrive at your preferred destination with no conflict of any kind. My objective is <em>not</em>, by extension, to be your friend, because I say with total assurance that you will never see me again after this encounter. With this in mind, where will I take you, Dale?"</p>
<p>I looked over to see that he was leaning towards me, eyes widened and lips slightly parted. I've no doubt that he was infatuated with me, presumably for the same reason that I was drawn to him. </p>
<p>Were he to be like any other victim, I know that my test would've rendered him anxious; quite the opposite of how he was then. There was eagerness to his thin face, a hunger in his eyes that betrayed his otherwise harmless appearance. </p>
<p>"That's so unfortunate. I like making friends. Very much. You can never make enough friends," he said as he fastened his seat belt with a cheeky smile. That was no doubt a test of his own, and it was terribly forced. This man was an amateur.</p>
<hr />
<p>I didn't drive to his destination. Rather, I drove to an abandoned facility that served as an excellent repository for my victims in times prior. He did, of course, inquire as to where I was going when we were en route, but he seemed satisfied with my answer that it was a shortcut. </p>
<p>I parked in a vacant parking lot that was populated only by rusted cars and gravel.</p>
<p>"Are you sure this is the right place?" he asked with a childlike curiosity. </p>
<p>"This is the address you gave me."</p>
<p>"But I've never seen this place before."</p>
<p>"<em>This</em> is the address you gave me." I removed the keys from the ignition. And suddenly, a toothy smile stretched Dale's cheeks wide.</p>
<p>"What happens now?" he asked with a lowered tone that was neither childlike nor curious. </p>
<p>"You depart and find shelter in your destination." He unbuckled his seat belt. </p>
<p>"And what if I refuse? What if, instead, I kill you right here and now since you were stupid enough to bring me to an abandoned area that I could easily throw your body away in?"</p>
<p>At this point, I tried with all my power to stifle laughter. My eyes began to water. Dale didn't like this.</p>
<p>"What's funny?" he asked as he removed a large blade from his jacket. "Tell me, what's funny? Oh! Oh! Don't tell me. I'll pitch something else to you. Say I stab you to death and steal your truck and dump your body in a ditch. Is that funny?"</p>
<p>I wiped a tear from my eye, and the events that followed immediately after were difficult to remember in full clarity, so bear with me. </p>
<p>I recall throwing a jab and breaking his nose, and then blood and screams, and then the knife was mine and at his throat. And the blade was pressed harder against his neck. And he kicked, but I didn't yield. He was surprisingly strong for his size, I remember that too. And he barked at me. "KILL ME! KILL ME!" And I knew then what I had to do.</p>
<p>With blade in hand, I opened my door, came around to open his, and dragged him out onto the cold gravel. I thought of killing him there, I truly did, but that would've been too easy. He was not a man who feared death, nor was he one who I suspect had much to lose. And because of this, I knew that I ought to leave him a parting gift. </p>
<p>I leaned down as I pinned him under my weight, and I spoke as calmly as my adrenaline filled body would allow:</p>
<p>"You will never forget this night. You will never forget that you came across a man who was your superior in terms of intellect and strength. You will realize despite your lust for blood that there exists in this world people who are greater monsters than you will ever hope to become. And above all, Dale..."</p>
<p>I clasped his neck and enjoyed his struggle for air.</p>
<p>"Know that you lived because I <em>allowed</em> you to live. Know that your life was mine, and that you continued to exist because I willed it."</p>
<p>And with that, I gashed him at his leg, his arm, and his chest as he squirmed and kicked and barked, and I left him there to bleed. He would carry those mental and physical scars to the grave, and that, I feel, was much more satisfying than killing him. I do hope to see him again, however. He was the most fun I'd had in decades.</p>

<p>For as long as I lived, the frost chased us. Every step forward we took would be covered with oppressive ice. However, the sand blocked us with its destructive, drying heat. Anyone who travelled through either of those wastes were never seen again. No matter the preparations they took, the food brought, the protective cloaks worn, those adventurers never returned. Those who drove ahead of us were either beat back by the desert winds, or reduced to skeletal remains. As for those who fell behind into the unforgiving tundra, they were just swallowed up by the glacial mountains without a trace.  As far as we were concerned, we were surrounded by unfathomable voids. All we could do was push forward with a little pocket of life we called home. It wasn't particularly large, perhaps two days walk from one end to the other.  But it was enough to hold and support all of us. It was enough to hold me, my family, and the fellow Trekkers I call my people.</p>
<p>My family consisted of my wife, children, and aging mother. We were bound together by the pendants we wore around our necks, a symbol of unity and familial relations between us, granted by the Great Walker who guided and directed us along with the crowd of Trekkers that made our lives whole. These pendants were created to be unique to each family, as a sort of brand to separate us. Each pendant was a specific color. A child's pendant is given to him upon birth, and is the same pendant as his parents'. When that child is betrothed to another, his pendant's color and his beloved's pendant's color will be mixed in a ceremony, signifying a union. No two family's pendants were exactly alike, like the snowflakes upon the tundra. My family descended from a legendary hero who led the Trekkers from the frozen tundra to the lush green spot of hope, saving us from starvation. Before that, our people had been accustomed to simply living in frozen, deathly misery. This hero was not a native Trekker, and simply appeared one day from seemingly nothing. He appeared harried, and was evidently scared of where he originally came from, and whatever had treated him to make him act in such a way. He led us to somewhere further away from where he started. A place for prosperity, he said. He carried a compass — a tool usually only reserved for our Great Walker. With his compass, he led us into the promised land. For his efforts, he was given a pure white-jeweled pendant to represent the goodness in his soul, and the original Great Walker's daughter as a bride. He lived happily, and his wife bore children. However, he spoke of a land that he originally called his home, and needed to return, to make amends for something he had done. His wife was despondent, and begged him to cease his line of thinking. However, one day, he awoke, arose, and set off back into the tundra, alone, with his gleaming white pendant spinning in the wind.</p>
<p>My family retains his pendant, still as white as the eternal tundra snow. It is a sign of a true pillar of humanity, and incredibly rare among my people. </p>
<p>So, imagine my surprise when the desert spat out a grave containing remains with the same pendant, choked around the decomposing body's throat.</p>
<p>Etched into the tombstone is one single word.</p>

<p>Martin briefly flipped through the pages. "And what do they say?" he asked.</p>
<p>"That MartinCo has had the best quarter yet. We control the largest share in the continental market, we're about to overtake the biggest competitor in the UK, and offers for joint business ventures are coming in from the US and Middle East." Jessica smirked as she smoothed out the creases in her skirt.</p>
<p>Martin leaned back in his chair, steepled his fingers, and swiveled his chair. This is something that not anyone can do, for most people would just look ridiculous. But with Martin, this act become an art emanating power, effectively saying <em>anyone who opposes me will be dealt with without mercy</em>. It helps that he had practiced just this in the mirror quite a few times.</p>
<p>He glanced up at the large map on display, showing the continent of Europe. He mentally ticked off the markets, the <em>countries</em> that were effectively under his control, and was pleased with the result. However, something seemed off, something wasn't right...</p>
<p>"Jessica," he said, "what about Russia?"</p>
<p>Jessica straightened up. "What about 'Russia'?"</p>
<p>Martin pointed up at the map. "We have gained market share control over much of Western and Eastern Europe, but we've hardly made any in-roads into Russia. Why not?"</p>
<p>"It's..." Jessica began. "It's not exactly a prime market right now. The economy is not that great, and our commodities are not highly sought after there. It would not be a sound financial move, at this time."</p>
<p>"But Jessica, look!" Martin waved his hand at the map. "It's just so, so...imbalanced."</p>
<p>"Imbalanced?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I mean, when you look at this map and where we are, we are focusing far to much in the West. We must move East!"</p>
<p>"If it's balance you're after, I can have a different map brought in. One without Russia not on it."</p>
<p>"No, that won't work, I would know it's there. Besides, the trade routes are practically set up already." He got up from his chair and went to the map. "We can get supplies sent to Vilnius, Lithuania, have convoys bypass Minsk and go straight to Viciebsk, Belarus, and hop over the border to Smolensk and then Moscow! We could have our commodities selling there in a week!"</p>
<p>"I'm...not so sure, sir." Jessica worriedly chewed on a pen cap. "Those passes are difficult to navigate, especially being winter right now. And even if we could get there quickly, with such a low demand for our products, we might meet with high resistance."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! I want half of the UK team transferred to this project immediately. I want us selling in Moscow before the end of February. Now go!" He turned towards the window and placed his hand inside his breast coat pocket, feeling the comfort of his large wallet. </p>
<p>Jessica rose cautiously. "Sir, I'm not..."</p>
<p>Martin turned and raised a single eyebrow at Jessica (also a look practiced in the mirror). </p>
<p>Jessica nodded. "Yes sir." She hurriedly left the office.</p>
<p>Martin turned back to the window and caught his dim reflection in the glass, a stately figure with one armed draped across his chest. Yes, this venture into Russia will be exactly was is needed. Nothing could go wrong, now.</p>

Other than that I just spent time playing chess against myself. </p>
<p>After about a thousand sleeps I start getting lonely, hell I'd take that televangelist at this point. Every day I see him on the frozen television with his arm raised above his head, finger pointed at the sky as if accusing Michael. There's bits of spittle flying out of his mouth. He's doesn't seem like a pleasant guy. </p>
<p>After 2000 sleeps I decide to work on how to 'save us', but how? How do I move or destroy a planet? Maybe I can move us? I mean there's Mars, other than being uninhabitable, it's definitely not about to be smashed by a rogue planet. Let's do that. </p>
<p>For the next 3174 sleeps I work on rocket science, and astrodynamics. The problem with that is that the internet doesn't work. So I have to find books. Fortunately there's a crazy Swedish foundation that keeps the entire internet in print. So a boat trip to Sweden (54 Sleeps) I could finally get cracking on studying. 18000 sleeps later, I've copied the Hercules I perfectly. 2000 sleeps later it's launch day. 690 sleeps, insertion into Mars orbit. 750 All Colonists landed on martian surface, inflatable hab modules set up. As I turn on the last oxygen generator, I feel a sense of ceremony, I can FINALLY get my life back. I moved the Televangelist next to me to catch the second half of that amen. I flip the switch. Nothing, why isn't the baptist screaming "MEN" in my face? What is this?!</p>
<p>I head back to Sweden to figure out how to destroy a planet. </p>

<p>I've not been scared for a long time now.</p>
<p>At first the silence was crushing.  It's not loneliness that is the problem, the entire world is now my isolation tank, I can close my eyes and in that quiet my brain conjures entire realities.  Friends, family, smiling and laughing.  In those moments I can even forget that tiny ever present crescent in the sky.</p>
<p>No, loneliness is fine, it's the silence of the living that gets me.  The others don't move anymore, haven't for an eternity.  Their eyes though, if I catch someones face I feel them staring back, baring their soul.  Not going to lie, in the early days I broke down more than once, yelling at those unrelenting faces to say something, anything, just please stop staring.</p>
<p>Can't be yelling at statues if I'm going to save the world though, so now I just carry blindfolds.</p>
<p>The reason I'm not scared?  I figure I can't be alone, even if I can't see them.  Someone...something wrote that message on my arm and in all this time they've looked after me.  On the hardest days when I tried to end it, when I did end it, I would slip into the darkness and the embrace of oblivion, before waking up again unharmed.  Seemed like a curse at first, but like everything in this new reality I adapted, and you haven't lived until you've skydived without a parachute.</p>
<p>Whatever, whoever did this, they have to be interfering. Physics just doesn't make sense anymore.  Take batteries.  The laptop I'm writing this on is my fifth.  I had to upgrade after the previous four were filled with my notes.  Never had to recharge, never went down from 100%.  They get warm though, in the dark their screens glow from photons shooting off.</p>
<p>The sun still warms my skin, I cast shadows on the ground outside, but the sun doesn't change either.  I've looked at it so many times I could draw it's layout of spots in my sleep.  Then again that isn't saying much, after this long I know the back of everyones hands.</p>
<p>The sun warms my skin, and the air is warm, but the sun isn't warming the air,  the lack of wind confirms that paradox.  If I take a magnifying glass to the ground the concentrated light bursts paper into flame.</p>
<p>I spent months doing those tests.  Didn't have any better ideas, certainly had no illusions I could pilot a rocket by myself, so why not document the physics of this reality.  Perhaps by establishing my realities rules I could discern something about those who kept me here.  Eventually I got bored and walked off, leaving my equipment where it lay.  Not like I have to worry about anyone stealing it.</p>
<p>I learned to fly a fighter jet, hope they didn't get too annoyed at the amount of times they had to bring me back during that, but everyone needs a vacation.</p>
<p>When I got back to my experiments I didn't notice it at first.  In this timeless reality there are countless objects caught mid air, what's another one.  It took me a few minutes to realise that the object eight feet off the ground was my notebook.  That couldn't be right, I'd left it propped up on the table.  I spun around, was someone here?  I caught a glimpse of movement and jumped back, heart beating.</p>
<p>Idiot, it was one of my mirrors.</p>
<p>That didn't explain the notebook though.  I paced around the table, looking where the notebook had stood.  Nothing stood out, just the annoying reflection of the sun into my eyes.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Out of my pocket came a packet of tissues.  I tore the corner off one, propped it on the edge of the table and waited.</p>
<p>Waited.</p>
<p>Waited.</p>
<p>I got impatient and went for a walk.</p>
<p>I came back I don't know when.  Longer than the time to eat a meal, less than the time to learn the piano.  I hadn't worn a watch in a while, it's easy to lose track.</p>
<p>Eyes level with the table I stared at the tissue.  There was a good inch between it and the table, ever so gently pushed into the air by the suns reflected light.  Carefully, I picked up the mirror and rotated it, so it faced exactly halfway between the sun and that little crescent in the sky.</p>
<p>It took a while to find all the worlds mirrors.  Longer than the time to learn the piano, less than the time to move a world.  Took even longer to polish more of my own.  </p>
<p>Now I wait, staring at that little disc in the sky.</p>

<p>The Lost City of Kvoehr. Eons past our ancestors had left it here, choking in the embrace of Mother Abyss, believing in the prediction of the Celesteocles that it would remain when we returned.</p>
<p>But the people of Kvoehr had made one tragic mistake. They had believed, as many do, that they would remain forever. Inevitably their empire fell into collapse and declined, overwhelmed by barbarian raiders from the Dark.</p>
<p>Now from their greatness sprang many nations, and each coveted the old capital with its triple-walls, and the golden monolith that touched the Sun King's majesty. But only I still held the old maps.</p>
<p>"The horses don't go father than here," Grueld, my guide, said gruffly. He was a brute of a man, closer to a great ape that talked than a man possessed of an ape's strength. I wondered for the nth time if he were not truly some unholy soldier of the mechanomancers, but I quailed at the thought my expedition had drawn their baleful attention.</p>
<p>"Why not?" I questioned, wiping the thick sweat from my brow again.</p>
<p>"Because this is the last oasis I know of, and they can't carry enough water for themselves to drink beyond."</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to offer some astute reasoning, but was cruelly cut off by an angrily raised finger.</p>
<p>"Don't whine. The horses stay here, and we travel no more than three sleeps into the Sunlands. We cannot carry enough water for more than six sleeps."</p>
<p>Again I wondered why I let this brute, of questionable origins, be my guide. But in truth, I was forced to admit, he was the only one who had agreed to go so far as this.</p>
<p>So, with trepidation, I dismounted. Even through my thick soles I could feel the warmth of these lands on my feet, and dreaded the trek before us. </p>
<p>The horse, that vile hairy beast, reminiscent of its master, spit on me as a parting farewell. Grueld laughed heartily at my expense, even going so far as to roll his eyes at me when I reminded exactly who was paying him for this expedition. And so, under that auspicious start, our true journey began.</p>
<p>The sleeps passed in a haze. The sun-bleached rock and sand reflected the majesty of the Sun's light directly into my face, as though punishing me for my temerity in treading so far on the Sun's domain. I was forced many times to wrap rags around my face to keep from burning, led on only by grasing at Grueld's cloak.</p>
<p>The sand and rock burnt my feet, and it was only at sleep, when we put the thick bedrolls down, that I got any respite at all. Grueld awfully rationed the water, and by the second sleep my throat was so dry I wondered that I could even talk.</p>
<p>At last we arrived at a point where both I and Grueld could fast feel the third sleep approaching, but we still had not reached the great cliff in which was nestled the city. We tread on in silence, until at last Grueld began to set down his pack.</p>
<p>"I can't go back from here." I croaked. "The city should be no more than another sleep away."</p>
<p>Grueld GROWLED at me, like the animal he was. "I will not die for some fools gambit. Wait a star-cycle, perhaps two, and you shall reach your city then. No men shall be able to inhabit it before four or five star-cycles regardless."</p>
<p>I must admit that I did somewhat regret what I did next, but to see my dreams so close...and for that ape Grueld to take them away...I was not in my right mind you must understand.</p>
<p>"THE WATER" Grueld screamed as my sword point pierced his waterskin, his own sword drawn too slowly in his surprise and fatigue. He looked down at my own skin before thrusting at me, but I hurled it to the ground even as I narrowly parried his blow, and the thirsty sands consumed it in an instant.</p>
<p>"You have killed us," Grueld muttered, his calm tone belied by his face, incandescent with rage. "I should kill you now, so that at least I may rest peacefully knowing you went first."</p>
<p>"No!" I explained. "Listen...the city...the city had a deep reservoir. We need only make it to the city, and even in this heat water should remain."</p>
<p>Grueld scowled furiously and then continued setting out the beds, silently now.</p>
<p>The time before the next sleep was even more hellish than the time that had come before. The Sun King punished us terribly for intruding so far, and as the waking came to a close I noticed I had forgotten to rag a small area on my arm. I had not even felt it as it reddened, then blackened, until my arm had fallen limp.</p>
<p>"It is almost sleep time," Grueld croaked. "We will not wake. I will kill you now."</p>
<p>He stumbled towards me, barely able to hold his sword, and I fell over in exhaustion and surprise.</p>
<p>As he pulled the blade above me for the coup de grace, I suddenly was filled with a renewed vigor. "WAIT," I shouted, somehow mustering the energy from some hidden reserve.</p>
<p>I pointed.</p>
<p>Ahead of us the city glimmered...glimmered? Something was wrong. The Lost City had three walls, this city had five. But I was too lost in the moment to worry, too giddy to find that I would live.</p>
<p>I stumbled towards the city, then ran, Grueld not far behind, and reached it quickly. My eyelids felt heavy, but the silver door (silver door?) of the city stood before me. It was ajar, though only slightly, and I stepped beyond that barrier like a conquering hero.</p>
<p>On the other side, it was cool. The heat of the sun was gone, somehow, perhaps a blessing of the Sun King (though no records had mentioned this.) Grueld sniffed hungrily and headed off to some strange silvered contraption while I simply basked in the magical weather.</p>
<p>"I smell water," he announced, and with one quick blow of his mighty blade struck the contraption such that water began to pour from it."</p>
<p>I drank deeply of the water, threw up some from drinking too quickly, then drank again. I filled my waterskin, and Grueld filled his own hastily repaired one.</p>
<p>Again the ape stalked off, and I was forced to follow. I found him gawking at some sculpture and was about ready to berate him when I followed his vision.</p>
<p>There, at the base of the sculpture, was an inscription. But not in Kvoehran, nor even with the Kvoehran alphabet. My eyes drew higher, and I recoiled in terror as finally, the sun-blindness fading, I saw for whom, for what, the statue had been made.</p>
<p>At first glance it seemed a man. But his fingers were bulbous like those of a frog, and instead of two legs he had three. Where ought to rest his mouth there was instead a gaping maw, like a slash wound, full of pointed glittering teeth.</p>
<p>This was not Kvoehr. Perhaps it once had been, as it rested where it should. But there had been others here. This was not Kvoehr any longer.</p>
<p>(I'll continue if people like it.)</p>

<p>It was such a lovely night. I had ventured far out enough that the faint glow of light pollution had only just touched this part of the world. The air was crisp and still, punctuated only by the low creaks and groans of this forgotten part of the forest. It had called to me when i was here 2 years ago and here i was again, marveling at the beauty of this place and its siren effect on me. If you looked just close enough you could still see the faint dig site i had hurriedly made to bury the man i had met off of I-90. He had been a relatively nice man and at the time I'm still not sure what possessed me to take him out here. It was a whim when i drove him to this spot, and it had been a whim when i stuck my knife in his throat. But on this whim i found something that i had never felt before, this palpable feeling of peace that had haunted me for years. It felt so natural that i knew this was my duty in this world. A loud groan from the forest snapped me back into the present and i bent down to pat the site once more for good luck. I stared back into the forest and as if to say something an old pine creaked beside me and i patted it on my way to the car smiling. No need to say goodbye, I'll be right back.</p>
<p>It only took an hour this time. The man had been walking on the shoulder of a stretch of highway not far from my patch of forest. It was a giant relief. Last month it had taken me two weeks to find anyone. If North Dakota hadn't been my last northern state to fulfill my duty in i would have given up completely, but i'm a man of principle and I'm not about to cut corners. I pulled over and politely asked the man if he'd like a ride and he seemed eager to get off the road. He sat down softly next to me and his appearance shocked me. Most of the people i picked up had a weary look that could only be attained by a lifetime of running from themselves. Their eyes were hollow and more often than not they gave off no real sense that they existed. They always seemed to be physical manifestations of ghosts that had just forgotten the part where the bodies were supposed to die. But not this man. He was illuminating. His hair was perfectly sculpted, his clothes were not just cleaned but ironed and pressed to perfection and his voice carried with a confidence that traveled men seldom have. It felt wrong, however the siren call of the forest had been powerful tonight and i could not abandon my duty. In a twist of good faith the man had been needing to travel in the direction of my patch of forest. This was fantastic. It was rather difficult to hold a knife to a mans throat for so many miles and this would save me the annoyance of all the begging and pleading i had grown accustomed to. We maintained a pleasant conversation almost all of the way there. We discussed sports, current events, how the weather this time of year was fantastic. It was truly great small talk. I hadn't been able to enjoy a conversation with someone in so long, that I began to lose that uneasy feeling that had first accompanied the man. The feeling did return however, when i made the turn to head back into the forest. He had not said a word when i made the turn. In fact, it seemed like he was completely comfortable with what i was doing. I began to feel something i hadn't felt in years, a building sense of dread that frankly had no rational base. I clutched the knife under my thigh tight to regain my composure. I was in control here, not him. I stopped the in front of the tree and before i could say a word i felt a sharp burning in my chest. Before i looked down i already knew what had occurred. It had felt to wrong and yet at the same time all to similar. The conversation, the appearance of the man. I looked down at the knife in my chest and breathed a rattling sigh. The man looked at me with a knowing expression, and I smiled back at him. It was okay i was at peace, he was after all, just doing his duty.</p>
<p>The man buried the body next to the shoddy grave site. He wiped his hands on the grass and stood up taking one last look into the forest. A cold wind blew through and the forest was alive with its beautiful call. The man walked back to the car smiling, stopping only to pat the old pine on his way.</p>

<p>We chase the light.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years we have followed the sun mother. She moves slowly, casting great lakes of fresh water out of the frozen, dark abyss in front. Weeds and plants sprout weakly in the new day, yearning upwards and bringing us nutrition and life. We are a blessed people, and as the holy sun mother watches over us so we shall ever be.</p>
<p>I am but another elder of the tribes, our nation stretching from the great ice caps of the demon kin, all the way to the melting sea. The world is a harsh and brutal place, and as the sun mother turns the land in front to bounty, so she burns all behind us in her vengeful wrath. </p>
<p>The demon kin dwell in their ice palaces, freezing the brave and the foolish with gusts and flurries to bind skin to leather in awful matrimony. It is a place of freezing death, though the fish that live beneath the surface provide some sustenance. Nevertheless, as the sun mother moves, so do we.</p>
<p>In recent times her benevolence has increased. Great fields of wheat and crops have burst forth with the coming of the sun mothers rays, and the stormy winds she throws onto the ground in her path.</p>
<p>She feeds us pots and simple dwellings, makeshift tools and animal carcasses kept preserved in the ice. The meat is tough, but manageable, and it complements the limited supply from the beasts we farm.</p>
<p>Some heathens whisper of another nation. A nation who leaves these things in their stead, such that we might not be alone in the sun mothers embrace. Such talk is blasphemy, and the elder council was right to decide upon their exile. Let them walk the scorching earth behind us, let them chew on their words as they burn.</p>
<p>The sun mother is life, and the sun mother is love.</p>
<p>Repent! Lest you see the ire the sun mother feeds to the damned.</p>
<hr />
<p>We chase the dark.</p>
<p><em>5</em></p>
<p>For centuries we've grown, living on this slither of life; running from the cold abyss behind us towards the blazing deserts in front. It left us with little. What little storms there were threw some fresh water our way, but the ground was soft, and spent. Crops struggled to grow in the stony hard ground, but we clung to life. The horse herds roamed freely enough, sprinting through the storms behind us to the tundra that had briefly blossomed, but not yet frozen. </p>
<p>Through wind and rain we followed, and found food outside the thin land of our previous existence. Through the storms and death we travelled, but finally found our stable food source.</p>
<p><em>4</em></p>
<p>Slowly we turned to crops, making the most of the land behind us for as long as we could. We domesticated the horses to speed us through the weather, making the journey through the weather wall merely dangerous, not quite almost suicide. It gave us a good chance at making it back. </p>
<p>We started to plan. We planted crops in dry scorched earth and waited for the storms to move, waited for the rains to turn what was barren into life. Our horse farmers sped through, bringing back wagons of crops and wheat. </p>
<p>The weather wall separates us from this place of naturally clement weather, where children are raised in relative safety and warmth, and the place that bears us food, that bears us life.</p>
<p><em>3</em></p>
<p>Slowly we turned to learning. Somehow, and I admit I'm hazy on the science, we figured out how to turn sand (something we've never been short of) into glass. Our eyes could see further, and as old age took our people so they could see for longer. Intellectualism blossomed as legs that could no longer ride horses held eyes that looked upwards, to the stars.</p>
<p><em>2</em></p>
<p>Nothing is ever free in this life, nothing is ever easy. As our people learned to live in this inhospitable terrain, we realised we were possibly not the only people in it. Geological evidence points to the land around the frozen ice caps as having once been a land bridge. What little data we are able to attain suggests that our early ancestors migrated down from a point near the poles. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it seems likely that since we find ourselves scratching out our existence in the thin wedge between the frozen wastes and the deserts, so there might be another. For them the frozen wastes and storms would be in front, and the deserts behind.</p>
<p>We tried to reach them, but no explorers ever found these others, if they exist. What expeditions tried to go forward we later discovered burnt and dried out. Those that went backwards into the frost, were never heard from again.</p>
<p>We have decided to try another tact. Rather than go forwards or backwards, we have decided to go up. After all, if we have to survive somewhere inhospitable to find our way over, it had just as well be space.</p>
<p>For now the launches are just for communications craft; if we angle the craft correctly we should be able to bounce radio waves off them. This might let us talk to those that travel behind the weather wall. It might also let us see something else.</p>
<p><em>1</em></p>
<p>The countdown ends, and we my friends are about to see history. Let us see if this launch will finally be the one to succeed. Let us see what other secrets we might unveil, if we dare to chase the dark.</p>

<p>When you have to get rid of a planet, you need to break a few eggs.<br />
As far as I could tell about the rule, its not allowed for a single human being to die; seems I need to save all 7 billion from this fucking rock catapulting at us. I figured that out during the first couple days of the timefreeze, when I was doing whatever the hell I wanted. I- well, tried to- killed an old client that had been making life hell for me in the past. Picked him up, threw him off the building. Right when he woke up whole world went black. I woke up in the field I started in later, I have no idea how "long" it was.<br />
The first problem is that if that godforsaken rock grazes us it kills billions; its about the same size of Earth as far as I could tell. The other problem is that I'm  not some astronaut who could do anything closely related to space to stop this hunk of planet; I'm just a chicken farmer in Asia.<br />
I spent what probably was years thinking through every single problem. No time was passing, so I never got tired, never had to sleep, or eat, just was able to think or move. </p>
<p>"Could I destroy this rogue planet?" I had all the time in the world, so if I could get my hands on some bombs then I could try. I rode a bike through China trying to find anything at all that I could use. Fun fact, the "no humans dying" rule included myself, so I could go however fast I wanted; if I crashed then I would just wake up in that field, next to the frozen chickens. After what was probably months I found the Chinese armory; a couple weeks later and I was into one of the biggest military foundations on Earth. I found some metric tons of C4 and knew that if I needed more, I had the entire worlds force at my fingertips. I could even get a nuke; it took me a decade but I finally got into the base.  </p>
<p>What was likely a century later, my plan was ruined. You see, something about this time situation I was in was that it was contained to this earth. I found out the hard way that if I left the atmosphere of Earth I would just awaken immediately at the field. They may had put that in place so that I couldn't escape Earth and try to just save myself, or some other reason; I had no clue. I had a worlds worth of demolitions to destroy this planet, but I couldn't reach it. This put me in a depression that lasted several lifetimes, until I got an idea.  </p>
<p>"If I can't destroy this planet, I can ruin ours."<br />
The "no lives affected" rule applies to humans alone, not to animals, and not to the earth as I saw. So after wallowing in a literal pool of tears (I never ran out of the liquid), I had an idea: The scientists on the television had said that the planet was hitting us straight on. However, I had read their notes a few years back, and read that it was actually hitting us at a slant. The entire South Equator was gone, but about where Greenland was, individuals could actually survive the blast. There was a bunker built miles and miles underground and a shelter that could host millions. The problem was that I needed 7 billion individuals safe.  So I had a two step plan.  </p>
<p>Step one: Get everyone over there. This was the hardest part of the plan. It also took what I bet was a literal eon of time to do, but I managed to pick up every single individual on this planet Earth and move them to Greenland. Searching through jungles, over deserts, in cities, evacuating them all slowly but surely to Greenland. Lifting them over my head and putting them all on a cargo plane (I learned the hard way how to fly a plane) and then bringing them all to Greenland. After that was complete I moved on to step two: getting them inside. I got the first 8 million inside just fine but then we started running out of room. A couple million more and the place was full to bursting; not a single soul could fit into this cavern.  So I did what any man with all the time in the world would do.<br />
I picked up a shovel and started digging.  </p>
<p>That's where I am now. I've been digging this hole for ages. Had the bright idea of keeping a journal of everything I've done so I wouldn't go insane, and am taking a break to fill you in. I've seen more rock than every mortal man on earth has combined. And I'll continue to do so for an eternity more, and then once the hole is big enough I'll have to make walls, make rooms, bring in livestock, allow everyone in here to actually survive. But I'm ready for that challenge. After all, I have all the time in the world.</p>

<p>In my time on this planet, I have become familiar with human history. Though most of my kind would regard this as a worthless endeavor, I find it both entertaining and useful. To those of you receiving this, you will need some background information.</p>
<p>There was a great leader in their past named Napoleon. He came closer than almost any in his time to uniting the fractious states of Europe, and he did it through <em>sheer will</em>. I admire his passion and his charisma, and I have tried to emulate him as best I can in my dealings with the humans. Not exactly, of course: times have changed. I'm not marching through Russia with a trail of cannons. No, I apply his ruthless tactics to the business world. I have become what the humans call a "titan of industry." And in human society, that matters far more than any political power. I have been able to profit greatly from 'advanced technology' that every member of my species would regard as simple. My fortune continues to grow as I spread my investments to certain industries that will be useful in the coming days.</p>
<p>I turn my sights now back to the stars. To the galaxy that I had written off as lost. I thought that I could be content here with my own thoughts, but I was wrong. My work is unfinished. Even though my own bridges are burnt, with these primitive human technologies I hope to build others. I have seeded their government-owned space program with the right breadcrumbs necessary to lead them to a working warp drive, and I have been developing my own chemical rockets to one day leave this rock once again. My investments in carbon nano-tubes are paying off nicely, and my design for the new space elevator will be announced in 2016. Slow but steady progress. What is another decade or two to a being with a lifespan as long as mine? </p>
<p>They look up to me as a leader and entrepreneur and philanthropist. If only they knew, though. Who I really was. What I have really <em>done</em>. All of the worlds that I have burned without so much as a pang of guilt. I do not relate to their Napoleon just because of his domineering will. I relate to him because of his lust for power. For his insatiable urge to control his peers to rise to the top. And like Napoleon, I too fell. I conquered a hundred species in a hundred solar systems in my own time before the others rose up against me and cast me out of society. Before this primitive world became my Elba. </p>
<p>Let this message be as a warning to those of your receiving this transmission. Like my hero Napoleon, I will not remain bound by my prison forever. I will return, and there will be no second Waterloo. </p>

<p>The math didn't lie: 10 million tonnes.</p>
<p>How in flaxnor was he going to get it?  That's a cube of the stuff roughly 260 Earth units on a side!  It helped that Earth is a lithophile planet, so it was reasonably common here, but still, getting that much was going to be a problem.  It was going to be costly, time-consuming, and gathering it all in one spot was bound to draw suspicion eventually.  You can't buy and stockpile that much metal without someone asking what you were planning to do with it.  Getting materials was the start of the challenge.  He also needed a huge assembly site, preferably somewhere remote, but not remote enough that he couldn't get workers.</p>

<p>Dr. Singh looked again from chart to the thin, white man sitting on the wrinkled paper of the fire engine examination table. Singh's expression kept morphing from confusion, to disbelief, to awe, while Elon maintained a nonchalant stare at the rotund middle-aged man. Singh puttered his words trying to find the next logical question which escaped his mind. Singh set down the chart and leaned with one arm on the counter that held all the extra-long Popsicle sticks, non-latex gloves, and his Spider-man band-aids.</p>
<p>“I know, bit of a shock I guess” Elon said breaking the pediatrician out of his dubiety. “Well I had you sign the NDA for a reason... plus your record shows that you're one of the best at dealing with these types of cases. Also, I read your superego before I came in the office so I know you won't tell anyone”</p>
<p>“Well... that's uh” Singh now had to deal with not only the fact that Elon Musk wanted him as his personal physician, but that Elon Musk apparently is an extraterrestrial and could read his psyche. “Are you reading my mind, now?”</p>
<p>“No. Do you want me to?”</p>
<p>“NO! And please don't do that again.”</p>
<p>Elon closed his eyes nodding in agreement for a moment, “Okay, I understand... so what do you think? can you fill my prescription or not?”</p>
<p>Singh now was more confused than before... How could a multi-millionaire, mind reading, alien not know that Zyrtek is an over the counter medicine. Singh didn't feel like going through this explanation with him and was starting to feel woozy.
“Yes mister Musk... just a let me grab the paper to write the prescription from my nurse... Can I tell her?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah sure... she's one of the good ones, too.” Elon pulled out his phone and casually started taping out something. He held up the phone and as it played the sound of a light-saber starting up and being waved, he pressed the send button for the little message he just pretyped for his incoming text. “Also, can I have one of the Spider-man stickers?”</p>
<p>“Those are bandaids.”</p>

<p>I was stranded here in Roswell. I am trying to help humanity, help myself. But they’re too stupid. All they need to do, is take my ideas. All they need to do, is put them in the right step. The right direction. But they continue to ignore me and move on with their worthless lives instead.</p>
<p>I was forced to take the shape of a human, I think I was cuter before. The FBI only knows that I’m an alien, they disguised me as a human to keep the masses from losing their minds. Smart move? Maybe.</p>
<p>It feels impossible for me to go back to my home, at least until the FTL drive is invented. Sometimes I just want to go ahead and make it myself, but the powers-that-be told me that I would be shot on the spot if that was to happen. If anybody ever reads this, listen to me. They are hiding information. Information that if given to the wrong person, could result in chaos that would wipe the entire civilization of yours. There would be no mommy for you to go cry to, your whole life; gone. In 1 second. You wouldn’t know what the hell happened. </p>
<p>I wonder what a cruel and immoral person would do such a deed. How can a single person hate a civilization? It makes no sense, unless if the person is from a whole different place. Unless, if that person was just taking their revenge.</p>
<p>Time to attack.</p>
<p>No. Stop, Elon. You're doing that thing again. You always forget this part.</p>
<p>It seems as if living with humans for so long has actually made me a waste of matter like them, because I'm forgetting important things. I'm forgetting things that I wish were not true. I <em>want to</em> forget them.</p>
<p>I forgot it. I forgot how to make the FTL drive. I just don't remember it. It's driving me insane day after day after day. I depend on them to figure it out. The FBI does not know this, and I don't want them to know. They would exploit me. Alas, I depend on these inferior minds to discover what my ancestors discovered a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>As a product of the new generation, I never paid attention to science from a thousand years ago, taking it as things that just are and need not be explained. Oh, silly me. </p>
<p>I would weep for my life, if I had working tear ducts. </p>

<p>There were those who chased the sun and those who fled it.</p>
<p>And in between them were the strange wastes. Lands of bitter tundra or barren, desiccated desert, the sun a tyrant on their backs or on their faces.</p>
<p>Each people had legends of the other: the people on the far side of the world where life was good and where somehow the sun lay calm over green fields for generation upon generation.</p>
<p>They were tales for children to ease their minds to the Walk.</p>
<p>Nathan walked on the edge. Ahead of him, the desert was beginning to turn. Saplings, long dormant under the hell of sand and dust, were now pushing through, reacting to the cooler climate. Grass had already colonized the ground, sparse and brown far ahead, but getting ever greener and greener until it reached Nathan’s feet, thick and lush and healthy.</p>
<p>He knelt. Only grass could exist this close to the edge. This broad belt of grass reaching as far as he could see north and south would eventually sprout trees, vegetables and flowers for Nathan’s people and for the animals that travelled with them, domestic and wild. And eventually, as the planet turned, the trees would die, and then the vegetables and then the flowers until finally all that was left was another long belt of grass and then that too would disappear into the cold wastes far, far behind Nathan. </p>
<p>His people chased the sun, but they did not worship it. It had been eons since they thought of the sun as a god. It lured them onwards, and they were fish, mesmerised by the bait. They did not worship it just as they did not worship the rolling ground on which they walked. It was and could not be any other way.</p>
<p>Nathan plucked a grass-shoot. He enjoyed this place at the edge, always. He liked the wide expanse of horizon, the emptiness of the land. Most of his people lived far deeper in the habitable zone, moving with the greatest bounty. But for Nathan the sight of grass, the feel of new life, was what kept him moving. </p>
<p>He wanted to meet the others. He knew the stories were for children. But if he existed, if he could live, then so could they. They would see the frozen land creep up on them, its snows melt and turn to rivers and the grass grow through the cold ground. Nathan thought he would prefer that. He wanted to see a river burst into existence. </p>
<p>He stood and looked ahead of him. The grass rolled onwards. A flash of light between clouds caught on something in the distance. He stared. Usually the grass dulled the light on the ground and the sand and rocks gave nothing but a glare. This was something different.
Nathan walked ahead. The object shone again as the clouds parted. It was perched on a pole between two rocks. A simple box.</p>
<p>Nathan stopped. It was a hundred yards ahead of him, but he could see clearly that this was nothing that the desert had made. Winds and sands did not make this shape. There was an urge in him to rush forward to it, but another part of him made him pause. He was fearful and he could not fully express why. It was not of his people. It was different and unknown, yet still undeniable. Yes, that was why he could feel a knot forming in his stomach. He knew what he was about to find and he knew that things would change.</p>
<p>He approached. The box had been routed on the pole and the pole driven deep into the ground and support there by metal supports. The wind and sand had taken its toll. There were holes in the box where the sand had penetrated, but it had kept much of its shape. That alone impressed Nathan. He put his hand on it. It was hot from the sun. The lid of the box opened easily under his touch. And within was another container, this one shining and pristine. He lifted it out. </p>
<p>He felt his pulse make steady contact with the side of the container. He looked up for a moment at the grass and then, distant, at the endless, unknowable desert, and then he opened the container.</p>
<p>There were two metal sheets inside with carvings on them. </p>
<p>He did not know the language. He knew that none of his people would know. </p>
<p>Joy began to sift through him. There were others. Remote, so vastly remote, but they were there. And suddenly he did not feel as if he stood on the edge of anything, that this grass had died at the feet of other people and now grew at his feet. </p>
<p>He stared at the horizon, wondering.</p>

<p>March 10th:  Our teacher asked us to write about what we think we will find.  I sat down for a long time trying to think about what we would find, but my mind kept wandering to what I want us to find.  It's hard to differentiate the two sometimes, and i'm forever an optomist, so of course I set unreasonable expectations.  </p>
<p>We are, give or take, 100 miles from Mecca A.  The trackers say that we should be there in nine days, and the entire tribe hasn't stopped talking about it in years.  We've known this day was coming for a long time, hell, it's all we've cared about for as long as I can remember. </p>
<p>On most nights, I like to go sit near the Elders and listen to their stories.  The story of our existence goes as such:  </p>
<p>Until 200 or so years ago, our purpose in life was simple: Survive.  At first, we tried to move as fast as we could, to gather more sunlight, maybe even move fast enough that we could settle down and not have to move for a while.  But that mission proved to be near impossible as it was quite difficult to have 100,000 people moving as fast as possible.  There was always stragglers, and stragglers caused more stragglers because people didn't want to leave their family members behind.  </p>
<p>At some point, the leaders decided that they could never really catch the day.  So we settled on just moving fast enough to not end up in the night.  The night brought with it weather so cold it, it caused your skin to freeze within minutes.  We tried building shelters, thinking we could stay put and outlast the night.  But we soon after learned that the night didn't stay for a little while, it stayed nearly forever.  Well, 107 years to be exact.  That's how long it takes our planet to rotate around the sun.  If we were to stay in one spot, it would take 200 or so years of night to see the day again.</p>
<p>So thats how life went for a while.  We lived in 15 degree temperatures almost permanently, moving our entire lives every 15 days.  Sometimes we walked fast enough that we got 20-25 days of rest before it became too cold to manage again.  </p>
<p>All of that changed 215 years ago, however.  That was when we first found things that didn't belong to us.  Not only that, they couldn't have belonged to us, or our ancestors before us.  Things so foreign to us, it tooks months to even determine the purpose of most items.  Small pieces of clothing, unprotected footwear, creams and lotions that said "for protection from the sun" on their labels.  </p>
<p>Or people had never seen such things, because our people never had any need for them.  The more things we found, the more convinced we became; there must be other people on this planet that lived beyond the day.  The things we found, they weren't intended for protection from the night, rather protection from the day.  </p>
<p>The ideas began flowing at that point.  We knew that we didn't want to live the way we did, and we also knew that if there were other people out there, we must meet them.  For gathering their intelligence, for hearing their stories, for finding out how they are able to live in the Day and move fast enough to stay in it.  But we wanted to meet them, mostly, because we were alone.  </p>
<p>At first, we thought if we moved fast enough, we could catch them.  Every indication we found was that they tribe moved just like ours, and stayed in spots nearly as long as us, or shorter.  We learned a lot about them from the things they left behind.  We sent scouts ahead, and everyime they failed.  They simply could not move fast enough to make any real head way.  We simply did not have the techonology to have contineous exponential movement.  </p>
<p>We could not slow down to meet them, the night would kill us before we ever got a chance.  We could not move fast enough, especially not 100,000 people all at once.  So the only option we had left remaining, was to start leaving artifacts of our own.  We had to let the others know they we too, existed, and we desperately wanted to see them.  So 200 or so years ago, we started leaving noted every single place we walked.  The first note we ever left was simple and to the point;  "There are others out there, and we walk behind you in your foot steps.  Please wait for us, we will be to you in less then 200 years."  </p>
<p>There was talk that maybe the others would stop when they read the first message and turn around.  Some people thought that we would see them in 100 years or so, with them walking towards us and meeting us half way.  But 100 years passed, 120, 150, and still no signs of them.  So we figured that they too must have something moving them, driving them to keep going.  There were theories that the Day became too hot in the middle, hence they too had to keep moving or else face extinction.  Most thought that that must be it, or else we would have seen them by now.  So we kept walking, and kept hoping that one day, some day, we would finally find who we were looking for.</p>
<p>March 18th:  Sorry We haven't spoken for so long, but it's been kind of crazy around here.  We walked 95 miles in the last eight days, and are less then 10 miles until we reach Mecca A.  It's the exact spot where we left the first message 200 years ago, and it was the first spot that we ever saw the artifacts of the others.  </p>
<p>Everyone has been going kind of crazy the last couple of days.  People are making all sorts of preperations.  The cooks are preparing meals fit for hundreds of thousands of people, enough to feed our tribe three times over.  We don't know too much about the others, but we do know that there are a lot more of them than us.  The items we found idicate as such, although their numbers have dwindled periodically, for what reason we do not know.  </p>
<p>The smartest minds of our tribe are practicing every single language we have ever come across.  We do not know what language they speak, but we are for certain that we will be able to communicate with them once we see each other.  </p>
<p>The history of our planet is shrouded in mystery, mostly because we haven't been able to track our progression.  Some say that we used to have a detailed history of our people, of everything that was.  But everything was either lost because we kept moving, or destroyed by the Night.  All we really have now, is our stories.  The elders have been telling them almost everyday for the past 200 years, and the kids grow up listening to them, learning them, memorizing them, until they too become elders and tell the same stories to the new young.  These stories are sacred to us, its all we have to connect to our past.  Before 200 or so years ago, our only purpose was to keep moving, and people didn't tell stories like we do now.  As a result, we barely know anything about our past before finding Mecca A.  You could say, that we found our purpose that day, and because of finding our purpose, we finally began recording it.  That's all I can talk to you for now, I have to go help with the preperations.  They say we will reach Mecca A by tomorrow night!</p>
<p>March 19th:  Today is the day!  I have but a brief few moments of rest before we start to move again.  Almost everything is ready for tonight.  The food is fully prepared, the drinks are stocked and ready to go.  The musicians have created new music for the Others, and some people have gotten together and created a play as well.  The Play is a representation of who we are, and what we have been through.  We figured that the Others will be just as curious about us as we are of them.  </p>
<p>I still haven't finished my homework from our teacher.  Every single one of my classmates is fully convinced that we will find them waiting for us, or at the very least, a message from them telling us about who they are, where they are going, and how we can find them.  My optomism has wained just a bit, because I found myself asking some very important questions last night after we last talked.</p>
<p>For one, why haven't we seen them in the last month or so?  Our elders tell us that they probably wouldn't walk backwards to find us because they don't know what direction we are coming from.  The elders tell us that the best option for them, to be to just wait for us at Mecca A, or leave us a message telling us more.  But I keep wondering, why aren't there any scouts?  We have been less than 200 miles from Mecca A for almost a month, yet we have seen no signs of them.  The weather behind them isn't so bad, so it would be reasonably easy for them to send scouts towards us.  Aren't they curious about who we are?  And even more logically, aren't they worried about who we are?  </p>
<p>Any intelligent species would be making preperations, in case things went wrong.  Even thought our entire tribe has been focusing on this day for nearly 200 years, it isn't to say that we havent made preperations.  We have been working on weapons, just in case, well you know.  We are excited, but we aren't stupid.  </p>

The door was not locked and he did not bother to knock.</p>
<p>"Jason! Where are you? Take a look at this."</p>
<p>There was no response and no sound which was not like Jason. He was found on his bed sitting up with a notepad and pen in his hand.</p>
<p>"Jason, look at this...Jason!"</p>
<p>There was no response from his glassy eyes and frozen lips. His body was room temperature but entirely motionless. No holes in the bends of his arms. No sign of trauma or life. No words on the page he held to his pen. He could not conjure any movement at all.</p>
<p>As he roamed from house to house he saw the same scene. No sound. No birds. No bugs. Only perfectly still neighbors. Hour after hour it was still about noon. A horrific realization began washing over him during the next few days as the sun sat motionless in the sky and nothing else, anywhere, moved. Ian gazed up at the approaching body and scoffed at the unimaginable task which seeped into his thoughts. A madness seeded his consciousness. </p>

<p>"Pressure?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I'm not detecting any changes," said William. "Atmospheric pressure same as it's ever been. Why do even bother checking?"</p>
<p>My patience was wearing thin as well, but it was important I didn't show that to William. "Lieutenant, unless you have a better way of getting off this rock, we're going to continue following the habitable zone until we find something we can use."</p>
<p>Our recon vessel had crash landed on the planet a few months ago. It had a narrow habitable zone that was constantly moving as the planet rotated. Since then, we'd settled into a rhythm. Every few days, we scouted as far into the habitable zone as we could looking for anything we could use as fuel to get us out of here. At this point, the colony ship would already have made it to New Earth. We just needed to catch up and rejoin our families.</p>
<p>William sighed but didn't respond. "Temperature's rising. We should turn back."</p>
<p>"Not yet. We have a few more miles before our engines overheat," I said.</p>
<p>We continued flying in silence, with William continuing to monitor readings.</p>
<p>"Wait," said William. "Take a look at this."</p>
<p>William's screen was a mess of numbers and graphs "I'm not sure what I'm seeing."</p>
<p>"Radiation. <em>Massive</em> amounts of it," said William.</p>
<p>"Take the ship down," I said.</p>
<p>"Are you serious?" asked William. "There's enough radiation down there to fry us alive."</p>
<p>"That's exactly what I'm hoping for," I said. Radiation meant there was probably something we could use. For the first time since we'd crashed, I felt hopeful.</p>
<p>Karen, our navigator, piloted the ship as low as we could without suffering permanent damage. "Get me a visual," I said.</p>
<p>A screen flickered to life. There was a massive structure below, but I couldn't quite make it out. "Take us lower."</p>
<p>Karen looked at me hesitantly. "We'll only be there for a few minutes," I said. "We don't have a choice."</p>
<p>We descended until the figure on the screen became clear.</p>
<p>All three of us stared at the screen.</p>
<p>The good news? We had definitely found something that would serve as a fuel source.</p>
<p>The bad news? It was the colony ship. It had crashed as well. And unlike us, they hadn't been lucky enough to land in the habitable zone.</p>

<p>The room was silent afterwards. And I could not blame them for the looks they where all shooting at me. When you become the most successful POTUS by reducing the National Debt to nothing, striking peace deals between long warring Middle Eastern factions, and setting the country up to become the world's first Carbon Neutral government; why in the hell would you invade Russia?</p>
<p>"I know that most of you think that an attack on Russia is out of the question, but you must know that I would not suggest such action unless it was absolutely necessary. Not a single one of our former enemies stand against us except for one nation. ISIS has been erased thanks to the help of our European and Asian allies, Korea is a fully unified front thanks to the efforts of our military, and even the nations that once harbored strong feelings of anti-American sentiment dwindle on a day to day basis due to our actions of reasoning and understanding. The only place to dare challenge the authority of the New Free Order is Russia. Talk has dried up, any efforts of our allies to aide them is met with armed resistance, and frankly I find it all a bit much when they refuse to acknowledge our peace to be one of mutual benefit and us relenting to their demands. If history had taught us anything, they are the one nation to stand between total Utopia and a continuation of status-quo bickering of olden days. It is my opinion that our efforts focus on stamping out the last of our hold outs in order to begin anew."</p>
<p>"But Mr. President. How could you, of all people, forget that not one single person in history has been able to take Russia?"</p>

<p>The rise to power had not been easy.</p>
<p>It began with unrest. The people of my country grew tired of corruption, of ignorance and greed. I offered an alternative. It was never my intention to become a demagogue. Seemingly overnight, people rallied to my words, carried my spite filled messages regarding the foreigners who would poison our homeland as if it were scripture. Soon enough, I didn't even have to win a democratic election. It was given to me.</p>
<p>That was in the 2050's. Through years of savvy maneuvering, political alliances, and shady deals, I managed to put my country in good standing with the many skeptic world leaders. This was hard to do, to convince to the world that a country with such a rich history as mine could turn to someone who is seemingly a dictator, and flourish under them. The accusations of human rights violations would be swept under the rug, along with the weapons manufacturing and uranium enrichment facilities. Things were coming along nicely. </p>
<p>It deviated in 2070. That year, for some reason, sparked a desire within me. My goal raged at my corporeal form, begging to be realized. I knew what had to be done. I set my sight for Russia. There was no true reason why, it made almost no sense to an outsider. Even to the large portion of my own country, my invasion seemed nonsensical. This was only exacerbated by the fact that my Chilean army was insignificantly ill prepared to invade the barren land in the dead of winter. Our forces were quickly crushed, and our bombs shot from the sky. </p>
<p>The entire world wasn't as much shocked as it was... confused. It really didn't add up. I suppose some things never will. My transgressions did, however, spark a great war between Chile and Russia, a terrible conflict that would claim thousands of lives in the counter invasion of our country. Once again, terribly thought out planning on my part, for which I take full responsibility. In fact, I'm obliged to take full responsibility as I write now, filling out this quick autobiography before I am marched from my cell to the U.N. Courts along with my military advisers for my unwarranted attack on a peaceful sovereign nation. </p>
<p>As I prepare to stand for my crimes, I must wonder, what truly is the allure to attempt Russia in the dead of winter?</p>

<p>My hands were getting sweaty as they do right before I do it. I had picked up this loner about thirty miles ago. These roads are desolate, no one is driving through here. I know I'm gonna kill this sad fuck just like the rest of them. I imagine the point of my knife just jumping in and out of his stomach. My pulse started to pick up. My vision was getting blurry, and I start seein' red. I love the feeling of bloodlust. I live for it. It's why I do this over and over again. Once was just not enough, there is no number of dead hitchhikers that can sate me. <br />
I pulled the car into a deserted park and ride on the right side of the road. My unfortunate co-pilot turns to me and says "Something's wrong? I know Ashford is just a bit up the road..." He seems nervous. Good. I like to see the fear written on their face. "Nah, buddy, everything's good. I just been driving for a bit 'n gotta stretch a little bit."<br />
He moves to undo his seatbelt, thinkin' he's gonna get out and walk around or something. Hah, fat chance says I. In a flash, I pull my knife and stab down into his belly. Pure extacy possesses my facial expression as I anticipate the telltale signs of his stomach bleeding out. That's when I hear it, that unfamiliar sound. A soft 'ting'.<br />
As I look down, I see he's blocked my knife with his own. "Think you're gonna pull a fast one on me eh? Got news for you pal, only one of us is leaving with our lives, and it's not gonna be you" my passenger remarks. With a flourish, he pushes back my knife and leaps out of the car. I can't let this guy go; none of the others ever escaped and I'm not about to let that change. We both bolt out of our doors. I slide across the hood with a rear arching swing, trying to stab him in the soft spot where the neck meets the collar bone.<br />
This guy's good, though. He anticipates my swing and leans back at the last second. My knife catches some fibers and tears his shirt. I hop back a step, knife brandished in front of my chest, edge pointed towards my prey, other hand up ready to guard. We both charge and swing down. I catch his knife arm by the wrist as it's coming towards me, and he does the same. I'm inches away from this guy, grappled. I can smell his rank sweat pouring off his forehead. We lock eyes, and for the first time I see the look on his face. It's the same one I get before I make a kill. My mind is racing, who is this guy? Where did he even come from? Why is he resisting so much? He catches a hint of my uneasiness from my eyes.<br />
"I'm gonna take a stab at this and suggest this isn't the first time you've killed a passenger. Well, got news for you, pal...this isn't the first time I've killed someone dumb enough to pick me up." We start struggling, trying to twist out of each other's grasp. I catch him off guard with a knee to the ribs, and send him to his knees. First thing I did after that was kicked his knife from his hand before I fell on top of him, poised to strike. Thinking I've got the advantage, I raise my knife in both hands ready to plunge it into his stinkin' heart. I roar and slam down on his chest. My blade connects, and I start to feel the warm sticky blood flow over my hands. I look down to see what I've done. Expecting to see his face writ with horror, all that remains is a shit eating grin. That's when I feel it, a sharp pain in my ribs. I look and see he's stuck me good. Another knife? I've messed up. Breathing's become harder. I feel the fluid building up in my chest. Dammit. Dammit dammit dammit! I've done this so many times before...why now? There were so many left to kill. I feel weak, vision's blurry, can't stay sittin' up anymore. Feelin' tired. Feelin' lighter. World's all horizontal now, breathin' in dirt. He ain't movin' either though.  </p>

<p>It was a terrible omen, Ptalus said, when we found the stone.  He was right.  It took less than 80 sleeps for our tribe to tear itself apart.  Marzan’s tongue ripped from his head for blasphemy, Harasa burned at the stake, the council poisoned by his grieving widow, whole families slaughtered by their sons in vengeance.  We come before you as a broken people, great chief of the Snake Shadows tribe, and we beg your mercy.   We are the last few of the Walking Wheel tribe, and I have led the last of us here in hope that you will accept us as your own, or else the Jackal tribe will take us as slaves and chattel, as is their way.</p>
<p>You wish to know what brought the Walking Wheels low, I am sure.  I will tell you.  It began with a stone.</p>
<p>The stone was ordinary granite, a spit of rock weathered by the dry winds into a grey finger the size of a man, poking out of a low hollow in the earth.  We found it while we were scouting into the daylight for a new camp.  It was Jereza who found the thing and could not leave well enough alone.  Does that not look like writing, Maeg? she asked.</p>
<p>No, I said, it looks like the scratching of a monstrous animal, worn away by many decades.  We should be glad that it so old, for the beast that made it must be long dead, or it must love the light and is no threat to us who live in the twilight between day and night.</p>
<p>That was when Ptalus said the stone was a terrible omen.  He was right, although he couldn’t have known what would befall us.  I only nodded at his words.  Jereza nodded too, but I remember the look on her face.  She was not convinced.  I knew there would be trouble.</p>
<p>But we needed a new place for the tribe to make camp, because the dark and the snow were coming behind us, as always.  We had stayed too long in the old place, and the chill had grown bitter.  So the three of us had gone as far into the daylight as we could, to find a new place.  I know you were a scout when you were younger, great chief.  My father spoke of you.  You would have seen how the dew of the day winds would settle there, giving us plentiful water and game.  And we found no other places that would make for a good home.  The elders agreed, although only after consulting the bones and then with much discussion afterwards.  The stone made them uneasy, but the place was too good to leave alone.</p>
<p>But it did not make Jereza uneasy.  Jereza who studied the stone.  Jereza who cleaned the grime from it.  Jereza who swore the scratches looked like carvings.  Like an inscription.  Like writing, even if it was too faint for anyone in the tribe to make out.</p>
<p>Jereza who pressed a batskin on the monolith and rubbed it with charcoal, so that the words could be read.</p>
<p>She is gone now.  Dead, I am almost certain.  I think Tadyas and Orfrendel killed her.  I think they did worse than that to her, before she died.  She who had been blood-cousin to them.  And because of the words she found, that turned the Walking Wheel against itself, for brother to kill brother.  </p>
<p>There are only nineteen of us left, great chief, and if you command, we will never speak of these things.  All of us will swear a soul oath, on that we are agreed.  But I will speak of the words now, if you would know them.  I warn you that you will wish I did not.</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>The words were like ours, but then … not.  Do you know how the speech of the Jackals are slightly different from the words of the Walking Wheels, and even more different than the speech of the Snake Shadows?  And then even more from the Cheliss tribe to your north?  A Jackal and a Cheliss could barely understand each other if they were to meet, I think.  The words on the stone were not spoken, but I think they came from a tribe very distant from us, at least eight or ten bands distant, maybe more.  It took Jereza thirty sleeps to understand them.</p>
<p>And this is the thing they said: That the tribe who wrote them walks with the day at their backs, and the night in front of them.</p>
<p>Yes, great chief.  It might be a lie written by angry ghosts.  That is what I want to believe.  But I do not know.  The stone was old.  It felt real.  It felt true. The writing looked like it was made by the hand of man.  And we have left our own markers in passing, that are not so different, I think.  It seemed like something made by an ordinary man from some other tribe much like our own.  It did not seem like something made by a ghost.</p>
<p>But if it was made by man, then our walk … that we exist only to go toward the light and away from the dark … what purpose is there to it?  Because then there is no eternal twilight that we will ever find.  Day and night will never become one; day and night are forever separate, forever moving, and there will never be an end to our walk.  The promises of the gods are false.  The legends are lies.  There will be no rest after I die, and no rest that my sons or their sons will ever find.  There is only the walk, there are tribes before us and behind us who seek … whatever the opposite of eternal twilight might be, where the night turns into day.  </p>
<p>At least, that is what the stone would have us believe.</p>
<p>It is a terrible thing to think, great chief.  The elders called it a lie, condemned any who repeated it.  But some of us were headstrong fools.  Marzan was not a bad man, but the elders took his tongue out because he could not stop wagging it.  And then there was blood, and more blood, and now the Walking Wheels are broken.</p>
<p>That is our story, great chief.  It is why we are brought low, and why the last of us have come to beg you to take us in.  In return, we swear to hold this secret to the end of our days, and to be your scouts, taking away any trace of those who walk before us so that your tribe will not suffer the same fate as our own.</p>
<p>We await your decision.</p>

<p>“Wander not, child of night. Fear ground that shakes, and sinking lakes,” Ren sang quietly. He dug his fingers into a boulder and slithered down it to the spongy ground cover below. “Fear the ghosts burning bright, who come to steal your sight tonight.” Winding his way through the fallen rocks, he ducked inside the youngwood ahead, slipping between the skinny trunks. As the trees shuddered and shook, Ren reached up with the corner of his shirt to wipe away the water that fell to his face from the skinny leaves. </p>
<p>Ren loved the forest. He loved the pale, dusky light that filtered through the leaves and vines, he loved the rustle of animals and the squish of mud under his toes. </p>
<p>He looked up at the sun to check his direction. <em>Water is west</em>, Nana’s voice echoed in his mind. <em>Water is west, and water is best.</em> </p>
<p>Ren could never remember the next verse of the song. He knew it started <em>Cry not, child of night,</em> but was the next line the <em>beasts that quake</em> or the <em>blood that burns?</em></p>
<p>(“Ren, please don’t sing that song,” Mam told him. “Don’t scare your sister.”)
Ren scowled. And then the ground fell away.</p>
<p>The dirt and rocks crumbled under his heel and with a shriek, Ren grabbed frantically for a handhold, a vine, anything—</p>
<p><em>Fear ground that shakes, and sinking lakes…</em></p>
<p>A searing pain in his arm, a twist of his ankle, and Ren tumbled down hill with the rush of dirt and brush and who knows what else. Each impact drove air from his lungs. He scrambled for purchase as dust and grit coated his eyes and mouth and if he could just <em>slow down</em>…!</p>
<p>Before he had time to process anything, the slide stopped.</p>
<p>Ren lay gasping for breath. His chest hurt, his leg hurt, his arm hurt. How could he have been so <em>stupid</em>? He <em>knew</em> how dangerous a youngwood could be; didn’t he explore them often enough?</p>
<p>Slowly, he eased himself up to a sitting position. He had to take stock of himself; could he even walk on his leg? Could he even make it back to Nana and Mam and Tip before sleep?</p>
<p>He blinked rapidly to clear some of the grit from his eyes. And then he saw it.</p>
<p>A lake. A huge lake with a monolith stone tower, rising from the lakebed, covered in glow-moss and carvings and <em>what was it</em>?</p>
<p>Ren grabbed a nearby branch that had been a fellow casualty of the mudslide and clambered to his feet. Before he knew it, he stood at water’s edge. There wasn’t just a tower. It was a stone <em>village</em>, bright green and effervescent blue in the murky dark of the water. </p>
<p><em>Fear ground that shakes, and sinking lakes, fear the ghosts burning bright, who come to steal your sight tonight…</em></p>
<p>Ren rubbed more vigorously at his eyes to try and clean them of the dirt and sand. His hand dropped; a flash of silver and white, gold and light, in the water, filtering between the stones.</p>
<p>There was something <em>in the water.</em></p>
<p><em>Ghosts burning bright, come to steal your sight tonight…</em></p>

<p>The first thing any scout learned was the meaning of death.</p>
<p>There are many deaths, each hunting men in their own way. The most patient waited beyond the edges of the world, waiting for the world to grow weak and unable to flee, as all things do. The worst of deaths scratched and tore at the world, forcing it this way or that in retreat, tearing great or little wounds in its skin. And the little deaths crept in through those scars, stalked us in shadows and sleep, slipped by the eyes of the scouts, and found us when we were weak.</p>
<p>But though there are many deaths, all deaths come from without the world, and there all deaths must return with their catch. For that reason, all deaths lie in stillness, in origin and in method. "To be still is to die - and to be dead is to lie still," as our teacher Tsegui told us. "To be a scout, to fight death, is to forever be moving," he would shout, as he watched over us sprinting, riding our mounts, leaping, and climbing. He would pace back and forth, kissing his teeth in disapproval at poor performances, at the other students.</p>
<p>But not at me. I worked hard. I was a born scout, I was told, and would grow into a man who would race the greatest of deaths. Tsegui never said this - but his quiet stare spoke volumes more than any word could have. Their praise would have warmed any other student's heart, but it did nothing to me. I knew, deep within, I would end up a disappointment to my people, to the scouts, to Tsegui. For I did not wish to race death, to watch against it, to protect my village. I would be disgraced by my wish. But I did not care.</p>
<p>I wished to walk into death, and return.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>What deaths do with the spirits of men is unknown to even the wisest of us, but there are theories. Most men understand death for its true nature, death as predator. Deaths hunt us, in their various ways, then bring us back to their den, the stillness beyond, and do whatever it is that deaths do with man-souls. Some men delude themselves into believing that the mortal world we live in is a prison, and that quiet deaths want to guide us into death, and that by walking into the stillness, we voluntarily shed our bodies in flame or frost, accepting freedom. What we call "the worst deaths", they preached, were really the "true deaths".</p>
<p>Though I wished to walk in death, I was not one of these fools. I had seen too much death, I knew there was no way that death was freedom. The faces on those who die of those heretics' "true deaths" are not one of acceptance or liberation - the faces I saw every night were those of pain and horror.
My wish to walk in death was tragic, in that sense. I would be committing the ultimate heresy, even though I did not believe in those blasphemies, that idiocy. But again, I didn't care about whether I was seen as heretic or believer, as deluded or understanding. I only cared about what lied in waiting in death, since I was a boy.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>By my estimations, in the 15 years I had been alive, the world has walked about 1000 kars. Though the day by day travel is slow - slow enough for my people to not need a rigorous scout's training to evade the stillness - the distance adds up, and now I was facing a great distance to travel into death. I was no fool - I knew I needed to travel as soon as possible, for with each day I spent in scout's training, my destination fell further and further into death. But unfortunately, the many years of scout's training were necessary for my journey. </p>
<p>Again, I was no fool. To walk into death is madness, and of course it invites death upon the crazy man who does so. To wade into the stillness, I would need to be prepared. I was lucky in that my destination lied in the white stillness - the black wastes, whose deaths burned the flesh, were impossible to protect against with any mortal means. But the white wastes, whose deaths chilled the body with frost... those could be protected against, however slight that protection might be. </p>
<p>I had no idea how cold the stillness might be, 1000 kars in. I had been only 1 kar in, and I had already been on the verge of freezing to death. The fact I did not die was a miracle - it was the evidence of my scout's soul, in the eyes of my people. Only a scout would survive such temperatuers for so long, as a mere babe. This was why my parents - who were no scouts - did not survive, though they were far. Without the soul of a scout, they succumbed to the cold quickly.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether I would make it the full 1000 kars or not, I needed to be prepared for the white wastes. And the best way to do that was not only to acquire a scout's training - which did cover the unfortunate times that a scout ended up in death's world however close, and needed to quickly return to the land of the living - but also to acquire a scout's garb. The scouts of the white wastes were given two outfits - a ceremonial set of ancient and tribal furred robes, and the actual scout's uniform, a more pragmatic and modernized form of the same outfit. The ceremonial outfit worn at inauguration was sweaty and stifling in the world's usual climate, it was said, but still worked well on the edges of the white wastes. </p>
<p>For my purposes, I would need everything I could get. That is why I would wear both - and spent much of my free time devising other possible countermeasures against the freezing cold. I would not walk into death unprepared. I was not like the heretics, willing to accept death. I sincerely wished to return, regardless of how scarred or tainted or corrupted I would be, uncaring of whether my people would accept me or not. I told myself that my purpose in doing this was to return - that it would be meaningless if I did not confirm what I saw that day, 15 years ago, to my people. </p>
<p>But I knew deep down, I did not care whether my people knew or not. Deep within my heart - my heart which was never warmed, which always lie cold in my chest - I only wanted to know for myself, and to see what I saw that day once more, to know it was no dream.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Scouts are special among my people. Though the original purpose of the scouts was to determine which way the world would walk each day, with growing knowledge and years of wisdom it has grown increasingly easier to predict the meanderings of the world. However, the edges of the world are still attacked and breached by the worst deaths many times a year, and these attacks are truly unpredictable. The scouts patrol the edges of the world, watch for these incursions, and then report them as swiftly as they can to the people of the world, before the incursions spread too far and too many lives are taken.
For this reason, many people assumed I had chosen to be a white scout as a result of the tragedy that befell my family as a child. </p>
<p>Mere days after my recovery, when I expressed an interest in becoming a scout, I overheard the elders speak of me: "It only makes sense," one said, "that he would wish to save others from his family's fate." Another spoke, solemnly, "His scout's soul wishes to watch against death, and it is easiest to watch that which one has seen." And lastly, Tsegui - I recognized his voice - whispered to the others, "Perhaps it is fortunate, then, that this tragedy befell him. We have been in need of a mighty scout."</p>
<p>To be honest, I did not care much about my family's loss. I knew I should have - and I was good at feigning this - but I could not love people I had never met. In fact, I could not love much at all, as far as I knew, but this did not bother me. It made my mission easier in some ways... without attachments, I had no risk, no worries.</p>
<p>But at the same time, this freedom made me weak. Tsegui, talking to the scouts on their first day of training, taught us this:</p>
<p>"A scout's soul is one of movement. Most men's souls walk with the world, complacent to keep pace with it - but a scout is driven to run, to seek beyond the world, to do something greater. It is this that gives you power. It is this that delivers you from death's clutches, that lets you outrun it. Without this drive -" Tsegui paused, as if remembering something. But his face betrayed no emotion, and he continued, "Without it, you lose the soul of a scout. Without determination, you cannot walk through death. Without attachments, you cannot stay tethered to the world."</p>
<p>I needed that tether. I knew if I walked into death's clutches with no anchor to life, I would succumb too fast. I had my goal, of course, but that was not enough, and I knew it. My first idea was to feign the attachments of others, but I could not bring myself to love people the same way, or to protect them. People did not concern me. My dreams did.</p>
<p>So I settled on my final solution - sharing that dream with the village, convincing them of what I had seen. Though it did not matter much, it did matter to me. And it was the best I could do. This cold heart was both my blessing, and my one weakness. But I would overcome it.</p>

<p>Maybe the priests were right. Maybe the ancestors were coming back, but there was no way they were coming back in THAT thing.</p>
<p>Out there on the middle of the mountain lake, sat the huge monument, half encrusted in ice, shining like a silver crown with spires going as high as the mountains around it. It had certainly been made by the same ones that made the relics you could see at churches. It had the same elegant lines, clean and simple. It also seemed to be made of the same strange materials, hard as metal but light as clay. Undecipherable writings could be seen etched in gigantic letters across the side. This was made by the ancestors, no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Immense as it was, the entire thing was falling apart, but not because it was old. He could see chunks breaking the water line near the shore, some of them evenly spaced as in some sort of crude formation. The structure itself looked as if it had hurriedly been broken apart by someone who didn't quite know how to put the pieces back together.</p>
<p>"Someone's been here before" he thought to himself.</p>
<hr />
<p>"They brought us to this land from the sky, and when they come back they will deliver us from all suffering and take us to our place among the stars. This is a sign from them!". If this was a sign, it didn't look like a good one. All they could bring from the lake looked torn and beaten down. Even the peaks around it looked like they had taken a solid beating.</p>
<p>The official story was that we had come from the stars, from other lands in the sky using ships that could fly like clouds. Why did they bring us here? that was a question no one seemed to agree on, but it seemed clear that it was a very poor choice of location, this place could barely sustain life. The priests placed the arrival at nearly 500 seasons and insisted we had come across half the planet already. If this was true, there was no way this was the ship we arrived on, our arrival should have had been on the opposite side of the planet.</p>
<p>And yet, right on the line of the ice, sat a huge, black ship crashed into the mountains. A humongous  insect-looking shell of a ship, located on the exact place it shouldn't be, and looking like it had been half-ransacked on a hurry by someone who wasn't us.</p>

<p>Score: 11</p>
<p>The first year was the hardest to endure.  When everything froze I had a panic attack that reduced me to convulsions on a closet floor.  I gathered blankets, pillows, and heavy objects like books, weights, and my stereo, with what little mental clarity I had.  After covering myself with everything, I waited for it to stop.  In hindsight it is kind of funny that I thought of the stop of time as a going-on, but this is an unnecessary point.  </p>
<p>I waited it out for what I thought must have been a couple of days.  This was when I was confronted with the problem of keeping time in a timeless world.  It was such a foreign concept, especially the sun remaining fixed in the sky, that I had to retreat to the closet and wait out the shocks every so often.  Eventually, my body fell into a rhythm and the cycles sleeping and waking were marked as days.  </p>
<p>It was after about 20 of these days that I noticed marks on my right forearm.  Whether they showed up all of a sudden or I was blind to them from my hysteria, it does not matter.  What does matter is that they spelled out “however long it takes save us.”  This naturally sent me back to my trusted closet for a few days.  </p>
<p>It took me 13 years to figure out what needed saving.  Apparently a rogue planet was about to hit the Earth and end all life here.  The government wasn’t going to tell anyone to avoid a panic.  If they were the ones who did this, which I haven’t found anything yet that points to that conclusion, they could’ve at least left some breadcrumbs behind to help. </p>
<p>Anyways, this is the very abridged beginning of the written account of my activity.  I figured writing would be a great birthday gift to myself.  Hopefully this year, lucky 136, will bring me closer to an answer.</p>

<p>Grug stepped slowly, carefully, in parallel with his lead-brothers. While he could not vocalize it, he could sense the unease mounting in the group. The familiar brushfloats, which came off the shrubs and rushed ahead in the breeze, had all but left many sleep-cycles ago. Sleep had not been easy, as a chilling wind has picked up which cut right through their tough poryp hide-covers and leathery, sun-washed skin. Even the great one was abandoning them, slipping ever so closer to the horizon, threatening to leave them without it's presence. Even so, as a lead-brother, it was his charge to continue forwards and mark the path for his tribe. There was no way to turn back; that path only lead to waste and destruction. </p>
<p>The brother on the right stopped and pointed forwards. Instinctively, Grug raised his club in anticipation of a sand-crawler, or even worse, a dune wurm. However, no scratching or rumbling could be heard. Carried from above by the cold wind came a storm of white, nameless specks. They had a tough walk ahead.</p>
<hr />
<p>Garron inspected his rusting spearpoint. Surface iron had not been seen in years, and much of the tools and weapons were in dire need of repair. The caravans rolled in behind him, the brushweave sails carried over the sands by the steady wind and strong arm of the rudderbearer. A fastidious lead-brother, he scanned the sands for the tell-tale trenches of a sandwurm, or the sand-crawler trails which inevitably lead to the next oasis. All that caught his vision was a tuft of... his remembered this word... fur. Although he was not the tribe's teller, as a child he still learned the tales of the Mammons, great hairy beasts which rivaled the wurms in size. That, of course, was in the past. The teller had said that the great dark was not of our lifetimes, and it was only our charge to carry the knowledge and tales of our ancestors for when the great dark would come again.</p>
<p>Coming up to the tuft, Garron swept away the hot sand to reveal more of the odd texture. A few loose corners flipped around, exposed to the breeze. Whatever it was, it was thin. Grasping a corner, he pulled the material up, revealing an odd, hooded garment covered in the fur. While it could, conceivably, be worn by someone his size, the material was old and patchy, and in some places so bare it resembled his poryp hide clothes. Surely, the teller would know what this puzzling item was.</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregory surveyed the dark snows below, feeling the low rumbling of the moving platform beneath him. Lead-Brother was more of a ceremonial role, passed down through generations. He at least did not understand why they couldn't just provide him with a forward-facing window so he could watch from the comfort of inside. At forty-five, all he had ever known was the dark side of the planet. His father would always reminisce of his childhood on the light side, and of the warm sands and bright day. The pictures and video never seemed to live up to the tale, and Gregory thought the boilers in the lower decks were just perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Today he did have an important job though. The "solar batteries" were finally giving way.  Not that his dad's "sun" amounted to much, since 90% of the energy intake was already provided by the wind. Irregardless, the batteries were needed on days when the wind did not blow, and luckily they had the heating towers of his ancestors to convert into electricity. Dug deep into the ground, the towers were once used for warmth, but were now strategic geothermal refueling stations for the convoy. He could see an outline up ahead through the snow, but it did not look much like the previous towers. Coming into view, he could see the billow of smoke rising up from the rubble. Something was wrong.</p>

<p>'Tell me about it.' The driver said. </p>
<p>'Drivers getting itchy about passengers now. Won't take hitchhikers because they're getting scared.' The young man picked up his backpack and shook it. 'Even less likely if you're carrying something. That just makes you seem even more suspicious.'</p>
<p>'I'm having a worse time of it. People just won't believe in altruism any more. And the news media is killing hitchhiking. All these bastards who just ruin it for the rest of us.' </p>
<p>They sat in comfortable silence. The young man smoked a cigarette and the driver  didn't mind at all. He always thought it added atmosphere to their kind of journeys. The young man dropped his cigarette out the window where it became a glowing jewel on the rode in the the rear view mirror. The young man craned his neck and could make out a sign ahead. It was a turnpike. Ideal for hitchhiking. He pointed it out to the driver.</p>
<p>'Just let me out here mate, that's brilliant.' The driver pointed the car at the hard shoulder and braked hard. They skidded to a stop. The young man stuck out his hand. </p>
<p>'Nice to meet a like minded traveller.' He said. The driver shook his hand. The young man pulled himself out the car and leant back to get his backpack. There was two loud pops. The driver clutched at his belly. It came away slick and red. Something glistened under the the torn parts of his shirt. The young man took a tissue out of his bag and wiped his face. </p>
<p>'Too trusting.' He said to the driver. 'You should be ashamed of yourself.' He dropped the tissue into the car and went round to the drivers side. The young man broke the window and reached through, grabbing the driver by the neck and squeezing him. There was a brief struggle. The young man stood up and and rubbed at the scratch on his face. Fucking typical he thought. </p>
<p>He stretched and looked around. Dawn was still a good few hours away. And the car really was very nice. He opened the door and hauled the driver out. There was a bog about a mile from here. He'd got the lay of the land memorised. He sighed and pulled the driver onto his shoulder in a fireman's lift. Time was a-wasting. </p>

<p>No one saw me coming, even though my coming was fated.</p>
<p>My birth was marked by omens: an eclipse, monks dying in moments of revelation, you know, the usual. It's amazing how suggestion can alter the memories of a people that have become an extension of my will.</p>
<p>My coming had been seeded well by my forefathers. For decades before my ascendance, powers taken from me and my country after the last war trickled back: an inevitable, gravitational return. First the constitution was amended to allow military activity, to little fanfare. Then, as a child, in my coronation I was given supreme control of the army (simply a ceremonial title you understand). The trickle became a flood when I declared martial law last year, but I am strong enough to weather it: the world is too busy scrambling to bleed as enough oil from their lands to keep from drowning in darkness. No one cares about my rocky islands at the end of the earth.</p>
<p>But each of these rocks I and my subjects stand on is sacred, and the world will soon remember their place: mere satellites. My priests say so, and the people cling to it, to me, as their saviour, to reclaim their rightful place as the master race with me as their god. I am the messiah to them, the Maitreya: and like a Buddha or a Byzantine Emperor, I am beyond them. I am but glimpsed behind a screen, or through smoke, and yet still my power is felt. A sighting of me, however fleeting or obscure, is the peak of a mortal mans existence, the closest they can come to divinity in the physical world. </p>
<p>It is a highly effective way to rule.</p>
<p>Academics will tell you that the world has moved beyond the era of religious propaganda, that it is no longer the opiate of the masses. Or at least they did: conformity, in my experience, is a wonderful side effect of penal battalions. </p>
<p>The Americans humiliated my land, but I learn from my forefathers mistakes: they are not a priority. But right on our doorstep lies endless land, endless resources, endless glory that I will give to my loyal followers. Whatsmore, there is nothing to stop me: for the endless land is wide open, its guardians are relics of a long dead superpower, bogged down in provincial warfare and heightened border tensions in the West, thanks in part to my agents (my will does not observe international borders). Perhaps we can repay their backstab in the final hours of the last war, and establish a position on the world stage where the Americans can yet see my will.</p>
<p>As I write this, The Diamond of the Russian East, Vladivostock, is being rapidly reduced to it's base carbon; it is the funeral pyre of the New Russian Empire, smothered in its cradle even as Tsar Sobyanin celebrates his victory over the pretender Shoigu with a military parade in Red Square, complete with the execution of the rebel Kadyrov. I am reminded of the carp, meandering in this very pond in this very garden in which I write, among the reeds and the lemongrass and the bamboo, even as the heron gazes on them from the world they do not see.</p>
<p>Reader, you can never know the awesome feeling of looking down at your emulators, and simply laughing as you might at a child wearing their fathers clothes, even as you move to smite them. Such is my view of the Russians, the fabled "Red Menace".</p>
<p>My attack Helicopters ignore General Winter, soaring through crisp arctic air over crisp arctic tundra, emblazoned with everything from Shinto blessings to anime characters (most of the ground crews are drafted highschool students, eager to serve after I set them loose of their teachers during my ascent to the celestial throne). My chosen have reached the river Yenisei, with the equally fervent regular troops in close pursuit: from our forward base at Krasnoyarsk, only ancient Novosibirsk, renamed for the even now semi-mythic founder of the New Russian Empire, Putin, as Putingrad, remains in our way. It has been fortified, but our technological might and my divine will knows no barrier: the 6th Army can surely take it, and by the time the cherry blossoms here, in my palace garden, fall, my disciples will have crossed the Urals and my air force will convey me to Moscow: they will have the privilege to feel my will in person.</p>
<p>None shall stand in my way. I am the wrath of the Gods, come to cleanse the world of the impure and the shameful. I am both the Emperor and the Shogun. The Maitreya and the Warrior. The fated sword cut and the hidden dagger. My sun shall rise, ever from the east, and the men of the west shall know my will: they will kneel or they will be consumed by my fire. Banzai!</p>

<h4>[WP] Elon Musk is actually a stranded alien who needs humanity to develop interstellar travel to get home</h4>
<p>Score: 9</p>
<p>He closed the door behind him and for the first time, he could let out a deep breath and hear his own thoughts. Elon Musk leaned into the door behind him as he locked it and sat for a second to collect his thoughts. His presentation had gone great! Investors were lining up, everyone was writing about him and people were raving about his new power sources. Maybe they would be enough. Maybe this could be a catalyst and they'll figure it out. But then it crept up again; the nagging thought that it just might not be enough for this civilization to discover space travel yet...</p>
<p>Elon had really fucked up this time. A Star-3 Pilot from his home planet of Noleksa, Elon was a brave but reckless soul from his planet and was considered one of the top pilots in his squadron. He didn't get there easily. His mother had died while giving birth to him and his father was busy working as a machinist to barely support the two of them. Elon had taken refuge in school and in learning, specifically about space. Elon wanted nothing more than to be a pilot, flying through the vastness of space knowing there is still somewhere left unexplored. He wanted to see it all. He would accompany his father some days to work where his father worked in the production of spaceship parts. Elon would talk to all the employees and sit in the back of some meetings on production. He knew what we wanted to do from day one. He seemed destined for it.</p>
<p>Noleksa praises the idea of finding new frontiers in space and learning what is out there and teach it prominently in their schools. Noleksa is known as a pioneer of sorts in space travel. Their scientists had perfected the art of precision wormhole production almost 300 years ago and now it was widely used in space travel for numerous planets in their system. And while Noleksa praised the exploration of space, they had a major taboo-travelling to planets with other civilizations outside of their system. It took a few horror stories, that Noleksan parents will tell their children at night if they misbehave, but Noleksa had wised up. Noleksan pilots are told to not approach planets with civilizations without proper observation first. </p>
<p>Elon slowly walked back to his desk and sank to his chair. He turned around to look out his window, out into the night sky. He missed it. It has been thirteen years since his fateful day and he missed his life on Noleksa. He wondered what had happened to his wife and daughter in Noleksa. Are they okay? They lived on the base back in Noleksa, where they lived free of charge because of his service. But after over ten years of being missing, are Noleksan pilots even still out looking for him? If he is presumed dead, will they evict his family? He struggled to fight back tears as he turned back around and looked at the news page with his face pictured with raving headlines around it. <em>You guys don't even understand what this is truly for</em>, he thought to himself. He had thought about telling the people that it was for interstellar space travel, but decided against it. He didn't want to tell these Earthlings too much. Noleksan's greatest enemies are ones that they happily told the information to and they've been the cause of some of the worst attacks on his planet. He's seen the irrational behavior of the majority of the planet. Yes, he sees potential in a good lot, but he shuddered at the idea of this planet meeting his own. </p>
<p>Elon traveled fast, weaving through asteroids and other floating space debris. His skills in navigating were unmatched his Star-3 squad. Star-3 pilots are a class of pilots that most aim to be. They are authorized for interstellar space exploration. They must go through a rigorous training on a wide range of topics, ranging from science classes specializing in rocks and planet formations to survival skills. He continued flying through the rocks before finally reaching a clearing which allowed him to relax. He looked away to his side screen and noticed his GPS wasn't turned on. <em>I'll have to turn that on after I check</em>, he thought to himself and swiped his screen to see if any messages awaited him. His face lit up when he saw a message from his wife and opened up the video message. </p>
<p>"Hi honey," his wife said as her face appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>"HI DADDY!" joyfully chirped his little daughter. He laughed lightly as he watched. "We've got a surprise for you, daddy!"</p>
<p>"Dlara, I thought I was gonna tell him and you were gonna show him?" she said as she looked towards her daughter who had already run around the corner to grab something. As she ran back, she was rolling a cart holding a large spacesuit with wings. His jaw dropped as he watched. "Your friend, Wolin, came by. He said he finally got the suit right." The suit she was talking about was the first suit for individuals "flying" through space. "I don't know when you're getting ho-".</p>
<p>The message cut quickly as the screen flashed red. He turned to look and saw that he hadn't been paying attention and had just entered the atmosphere of Earth. The gravity started to pull on his ship as he quickly attempted to right the thrusters. The ship started to pull up but soon lost it's momentum and started hurling towards the ground. He sat in the cockpit, swiping through many screens. He knew they had taught him this. <em>Okay, emergency jet thrust won't get me high enough out, so if I dip with gravity, build momentum and thrust at the trough as I thrust upward, it could work,</em> he thought quickly as he started to lean forward on the controls. <em>It has to work.</em> His screen flashed more, changing colors from red to orange. <em>As soon as it's yellow, pull up,</em> went through his head as he watched intently. The screen changed and Elon pulled on the controls and he hit the Emergency Thrust. He felt the usual buildup of the thrust and then...nothing. He felt his plane continuing the ascent, and losing velocity. <em>Come on, what's wrong? This can't happen! If it doesn't kick soon, I'll have no chance of getting up there...</em> his thoughts raced, as he pressed the button again out of desperation, despite the warnings against it. The thruster began its buildup again, rocking the ship as it progressed. <strong>BAM</strong> rang out loudly behind him and his heart sank. He blew out the thruster, he knew it. He prepared his parachute and emergency gear as he felt the plane reach the peak of its ascent. He swiped the warning screens away and went back to his message - the message from his family. </p>
<p>"-me, but we can't wait to see your smile when you see it in person. I love you, Elon." He wiped the tears away from his eye. "Bye daddy! I love you! See you soon!" squealed his daughter as he hit the eject button. </p>
<p>Even thirteen years later the memory brought tears to his eyes. He stared blankly at his screen as the tears slid down his cheeks. He shook out of his trance when he heard a rap at the door. "Come in", his voice shook as he quickly wiped his face. "Sir, SpaceX is on line 1. They said you had a presentation on Wormholes or something?"</p>

<p>They say 3rd time is the charm, does the same hold true for 3 lifetimes?</p>
<p>Every time I wake up I'm expecting to be another person. Death just has a way of sneaking up on you. It provokes anxiety, since remembering your own death can be too sobering in a way. It sucks, and I had to do it not just once but twice. I find it so strange that I'm the only human that is able to remember variations of myself.</p>
<p>As it holds true that my old enemy in the French legion seems to forget himself, he never appears the way I want or expect him to. Once he betrayed me and exiled me to that Godforsaken island. The second time I was so focused on watching my back I lost sight of what was in front of me. Both times I held the world at its' throat and both times it slipped through my fingers.</p>
<p>Not this time, this time the Cold Country will be mine. The White Jewel will be the pedestal from which I make my grand return. The first time I was too cocksure, the second too anxious. It seems history has a way of repeating itself, jumping the gun is my biggest failure. </p>
<p>So I have learnt, good things come to those who wait supposedly. Twice now I've cycled a 129 year period, that's more than two and a half centuries. I think I've been patient enough.</p>
<p>They say 3rd time is the charm, does the same hold true for the annihilation of a country?</p>
<p>After careful analysis I realize that my biggest asset is not just my military mind but my ability to manipulate. So this time I started from the inside. Now here I am the CEO of the biggest Fusion Safety organization in the world. Standing on a mountain of promised global safety. I have shaken the foundations of the Geneva convention and redefined what weapons are. I have removed several countries as a threat through bureaucracy alone. I have proven what weapons of mass destruction are capable of. </p>
<p>I have shown these people what war would look like if it got out of hand, what they just don't realize is I've been prophesizing their future to them. Every country that has surrendered their Fusion Weapons to me has made me stronger and today I'm finally ready to show these people what it means to be ruled. </p>
<p>I believe the only reason why I can remember my destiny is because I'm the only one that can succeed in this. Some deity saw it fit to grant me another chance, I will not squander this one.</p>
<p>They say 3rd time is the charm, does the same hold true for 3 billion people?
They say 3rd time is the charm, today France will be the testament to that statement.</p>

<p>Henry sat with his family, huddled close as they watched the timer count down in the lower right. All channels were showing the same thing: A telescope pointed a gigantic rock planet, headed our way. The screen switched between a live feed and The “Earth Union” that had sprung up after NASA had discovered the planet hurdling towards us. Funny what can happen when you all know you are going to die. You start working together, doing anything to save yourself. Wars basically stopped, although terrorist groups took advantage of the chaos and much of Europe was gone, not that it mattered as we would all be dead in 24 hours anyway. The TV would keep broadcasting until the last second, and most were watching it as what else could you really do? Henry had already emailed or texted everyone he ever knew, as the phones was down due to the heavy traffic. Some cults had started, many suicides were found, and the government was going to start handing out Suicide pills around hour 12 worldwide. The Earth was going to get really hot before we all died, and those of us against suicide would be in for hell of hot time. We probably would have wished we had taken them when our skin starts to melt off. All the world’s leaders in the Earth Union were giving epic speeches, though most of us hated the Earth Union. After serval dozen attempts at trying to stop the planet, they had resorted to building “an arc” where all the rich/famous and officials will board as well as astronauts and all matters of scientists. , along with frozen and of all earth’s species, will leave Earth around hour 12 for good. They will be bound for mars, and will try and make a home there. The rest of us get to die.
Hour twelve comes by and the Arc launches. It doesn’t even make it half way before a nuke explodes. The cameras fill with white and he can hear his wife cry out in shock, and his two kids start to cry. Henry closes his eyes. Now everyone smart is dead and the world will end. Way to go terrorists, you certainly got what you wanted. 
Henry looks around, the final moments of his life. His wife had served lemonade and unknown to him it had crushed pills in it. She had served it with a smile to his kids and offered him one, but he had declined. They drank as they watched the timer count down to zero. It wouldn’t happen exactly at zero, but the gravitational pull would mess up our power system or whatever, and everything would go silent until it was over. He saw it hit zero and he held the glass of lemonade. The President, god bless him had stayed behind as he wanted to comfort the nation until the TV stopped broadcasting. His final words were “Though I walk through the valley of death…” he didn’t even finish as it hit zero. Henry took a swig of the lemonade and rested his head on his wife’s still warm lap, his kids sleeping peacefully by her feet.
He woke up a few hours later, confused as hell. It was 6am on October 25th, 2015. That’s what the clock said. The TV showed the same image as when he had last closed his eyes: The President in the Rose Garden reading from a bible. Confused he went outside and knocked on his neighbor’s house door, one he knew that was sticking around. With no answer he opened it up, “Hello, Jeff? He said, entering the house, going to the living room. Jeff was frozen with his family, watching the TV with the same image on it. “Hello, Jeff?” he said, his voice full of wonder as he moved his hand in front of his eyes, clapped, yelled, but no movement came. 
With sudden pain his arm reddened, and in cursive it wrote directly into his flesh, “however long it takes, save us".” Henry looked at it, his mind boggled. This was all too much.
Day 2.
Henry was discovering new things about his frozen state. For one, he never felt tired or hungry. He hadn’t even though of food and he hadn’t eaten since Zero Day. Also, he could still move things, and internet, power, and everything worked. He had posted all over the net and on reddit, but nothing was being responded too, has he had come to learn, all humans were frozen. He could move them and touch them, and they were still warm to the touch. He made a decision early on that he would not mess with anyone. After all, his arm had said “save us.” Not “rape us.” 
After the initial shock, he spent days in grieving, for his family was dead, and yet here he was, still alive, trying to save the world… but what did it matter if he had nothing left to come back too?
Day 5
Henry hadn’t thought of documenting anything until after visiting his Brother. He was still alive and well, with his family huddled around him. “I won’t let you down, John; I will do this for you. Just because I lost everything, doesn’t mean you have too. I have… forever, I think” he said to his unmoving Brother.
Day 100
“A 100 days! “ Henry exclaimed to no one in particular. He had spent 100 days doing nothing except on his computer. Ever imagine what you could get done if you didn’t need to sleep or eat, or have any pesky people bothering you? Henry was building a network of ideas. He wasn’t the brightest guy but he had gone to college, and the first thing he knew what he should do is brain storm. How the hell do you stop a gigantic planet headed for earth? He had a couple of benefits that NASA and the Earth Union didn’t have: Time.  He could do anything now to get rid of it, after all, according to his scar he had unlimited time. This gave him options that no one had even considered. At first he went to the obvious thing: Get all the nukes and launch them at it. Then he had considered what might happen if it did blow up. So he had started learning computer modeling, code, and programming. It would take time as Henry had never been the technical type.
Day 562
He now had a more thorough understanding of the planet. Henry was at Titan, the super computer cluster in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It too had been already working on simulations of it impacting earth, but Henry had modified and added to the program, and had simulated blowing up the planet. He had tried it a thousand different ways, but each time the debris still destroyed earth. Right now the planet was about 100,000 miles away from earth. It was travelling at 25,000 miles per hour, and would have destroyed them in about 4 seconds after Zero. One thing he did not know for sure is that if he destroyed it, would time resume? He had to be sure that what he did would work 100%, as he didn’t want to unfreeze time only to fail.
Day 1022
Henry had set Titan on an algorithm that slightly modified the way he would blast the planet, from all angles, with different payloads, or timed explosions or what not. By his estimations, it would take around a decade to through all the feasible ones. In the meantime, Henry decided he needed a break. He had been learning about computers, robots, code, and such nonstop with no breaks for almost three years now. He decided he would re-watch some old movies and play some video games, all the ones he hadn’t had time for as a Father with two kids.
Day 2055
He put down the controller and rubbed his eyes. They didn’t hurt but it was an old habit. Just because he didn’t get tired anymore didn’t mean he would stop getting headaches. He would get them from time to time if he stared at a screen to long or didn’t get up and walk around. He had raided a GameStop and had set up a gaming heaven in a movie theater. He was getting bored; after all gaming alone is not so much fun after you play all the best single player titles. He had watched every movie he could find, and went to a bunch of cool places and seen all the remaining movie stars or famous people. He had also switched off any TV he found as he was sick of looking at the President.   He decided to get back to work. 
Day 2500
Titan had come up with nothing. Every scenario left earth destroyed. It was time to think of something else. He was becoming quite the nerd now, and had set up quite the station in Oakridge Library. Lucky for him none of the hardware seemed to age, whatever was happening had frozen time and objects but still allowed it to pass. It was odd, but he didn’t think about it often now. He was also building a network of computers for a distributed computing powerhouse. He had gone to all the big data centers in the US and installed his software, making use of the infrastructure that was his to use. He had a pretty good network now, and his simulations zipped by quickly, though nothing was working, no matter what he did the planet mass would still destroy earth.
Day 3021
Eight years since he had woken up still alive. At this point he had abandoned anything related to explosives. He was watching Wall-E while reading an e-book on advance A.I., when a brilliant idea came to him. He furiously started typing away at his keyboard, writing code and designing models through CAD. He worked through his headaches as inspiration took over him.</p>

Not that people especially cared though, they were mostly focused on bucket lists, those things they all wanted to do before they died, <strong>we</strong> all died. It was too late for me though, we'd known about this for almost two years - A giant rock, a planet, floating lazily into us. I'd been a salesman at a pet shop before the announcement, I couldn't just leave them all though, so I stuck around for the first few months. Some people were upfront; "I've always wanted to try cat before". Disgusting. Eventually I gave up - just brought what was left back home. My landlord complained at first, but eventually he too left on his "World Tour", just never came back. Were planes even still flying these days? I'd be surprised.</p>
<p>Governments had tried to salvage something but mistakes, split budgets, worker shortage, had all made it impossible to really get a plan into action. I heard Russia sent up a shuttle to the moon, but nobody really knows much more than that, or at least nobody I talked to.</p>
<p>So here I am, home, surrounded by everyone that really mattered to me. How depressing. I closed my eyes for the final time; a final cat nap before the end of the world.</p>
<p>I looked at my clock - 3:43pm</p>
<p>"That's a bit strange" I said aloud. It was probably at this point that I realized my apartment was a bit more quiet than I'd ever heard it. My words hung in the air, a small echo.</p>
<p>No Squawks. Meows. Barks. These were normal sounds. These sounds were not there.</p>
<p>It was when I reached for my door-handle that I noticed the text - "however long it takes, save us" - in comic sans. Cute.</p>
<p>At first I wasn't really sure what to do. I could interact with anything, pick it up, move it around, I could more-or-less will something to normal. Or the weird state of normal I was in.</p>
<p>The first few days were mostly testing. How many objects, people, things, could I keep going at once, could I force something back into time-lock, did other people know what was going on?</p>
<p>More or less, it looked like 1 person at a time, or infinitely many objects, or at least as close to infinity as smashing that bottle of change on my dresser. Had to be like, 100 bucks in there of just pennies and nickles.</p>
<p>Anyway. The president didn't know what was going either. Frankly he asked too many questions for my liking. It's a shame I didn't have a girlfriend, probably would have made for better company then the current scientist I'm working with.</p>
<p>Andrew. The first one that didn't scream when I unfroze him. Very cool, calm. So far he's only asked me the important questions, he's been the perfect helper. He and I are re-building the Saturn V rocket. He's apparently a pretty big rocket buff and this is the one he likes the most. I'm learning a lot just by working with him, but I can tell that this is going to be a long process. Good thing I've got all the time I need! I looked at my watch again today. Bad habit. 3:43pm. Of all the objects I work with everyday, I leave this one just as it is, a reminder of the work I need to complete.</p>
<p>A few months, years, decades, pass by uneventfully. We've got most of the parts here, and for the things we don't, we collect. The drives are probably the longest part of this. One time I forgot a couple very <em>particular</em> washers a few states over. I'm human, you know, I make mistakes. Well without them Andrew wasn't going to be able to keep going. He ended up coming with me "in case we needed anything else". Ha. He ended up just complaining the whole way there. But he was Andrew, my only friend in this "world". I could have just frozen him, just for a few minutes of silence, but it seemed to me that I probably deserved it.</p>
<p>Either way, after a few more decades, it was upright, in place, and ready to launch.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure why we built a space faring vessel instead of a missile, but Andrew said we could just bring a payload with us. Made sense. I'm not really a thinker though.</p>
<p>Really though, of all the people on this planet, they choose me. Why not someone like Andrew? Hell he's basically handling this on his own anyways, I'm just the mojo for him to be not-as-frozen-as-everyone-else.</p>
<p>Andrew snapped his fingers in my face. "Hey" he grinned. "We're all loaded up, 10 of the largest warheads known to mankind. Let's get this rocket a movin'"</p>
<p>I took one last look at the rocket. She was ugly as sin. Mismatched metal made for atmospheric exit only; this was a one way trip for us. The unknown saviors of the planet. I thought about leaving a note or something, but it's not like they could praise me. I chuckled. I guess I'm a benevolent god.</p>
<p>As I strapped myself to the chair and flicked open the cover on the initiate button, I looked over to Andrew. "Are we really going to land this ship on the planet and <strong>then</strong> blow it up?"</p>
<p>"It's the only way to be sure they go off in the right spots, you know that. You're the one who has to set the timer and then unfreeze them."</p>
<p>I shrugged "I just thought it would be more <em>spectacular</em> or something."</p>
<p>"You're sitting in a 40 year old rocket, on your way to an unknown planet in space, with over 400 megatons of explosive material on a stopwatch, and nobody will ever know. Spectacular is an understatement."</p>
<p>I pushed the button.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, everything happened exactly as it was supposed to. Andrew had made meticulous checks and re-checks of everything. It was a straight shot thankfully, and the small deviations we're all handled by the computer. We arrived to it just shy of a day later.</p>
<p>Stepping out onto the planet was...different. It had more gravity than I thought it would. The ground was solid, clear. It was like walking on a garden path rather than on a pile of dust like I expected. I suppose it was flying through space, so maybe it got dusted off? I barely understood how rocket fuel worked and I spent 6 months making the stuff. I shrugged. Not like it really matters.</p>
<p>I grabbed the first bomb and loaded it up onto the wheel assembly. We'd found a few cavern entrances on the surface where we wanted to land. A stationary target is pretty easy to hit.</p>
<p>I walked into the first cave, with Andrew driving the little rover, it was a tight fit, but we were confident that the tunnel was our ticket to drop-zone 1.</p>
<p>The cave on the other hand, had no such predication. Each time we found a suitable spot, we decided that they could be a better one just ahead. We had time, so why not? I stumbled. The clear pathway I had been walking for almost an hour suddenly had a rock on it. It was so out of character for the uniform...ish... cave that this was the first real rock I'd seen so far. I picked it up. Is that...Moss? Space Moss?</p>
<p>Andrew was as surprised as I was when he took a look. Nothing he'd ever seen before. We elected to scout ahead. If there was moss here, then maybe we'd get the rover stuck if we went to far forward. We only had one, so it was important to keep it going.</p>
<p>The further we went, the thicker the moss got. Wall, ceiling, it didn't matter. I saw a light up ahead, but not natural light. It had a purple hue to it. Andrew suggested bio-luminescence. Sure. Lets go with that.</p>
<p>We reached the purple light, but it wasn't anything like we expected. In fact, it was a button that said "Push". Written right there. In English. On the surface of a planet nobody had ever been to before. In Comic Sans. I did what any self-respecting human would have done. I pushed it.</p>
<p>A door slid open and the purple light increased. We turned off our lights and stepped in.</p>
<p>In the center of the room lay a floating ball of light - honestly it looked like something out of Star Trek. The room was circular, with little benches on the walls gradually climbing to the ceiling. Tiers and tiers of them. Movement caught my eye. That was a strange sensation.</p>
<p>Wait. Movement?</p>
<p>I looked at Andrew, and he was clearly there, right in the spot where he was 10 seconds before. I looked back. Two little eyes peeked over one of the upper benches. I didn't really know what to do. Something in those eyes reminded me of an animal, a domesticated cat or dog perhaps. I shook my head. I must be seeing things.</p>
<p>"Are you here to save us? We have been waiting"</p>

<p>It was done. I've made it into space. The hardest part was over - at least that's what Adam told me. Now all that was left to do was exit the space shuttle in the SAFER, steer towards the rogue planet, use the attachment drill to hook myself onto it, and start the thrusters.</p>
<p>It would take time - 22,457 years  at 0.5 miles per hour according to his calculations - but at least it would be easy. After all, I've already spent about twice as much to build and perfect him. When time had stopped, I quickly realized that my brain was not capable of processing, organizing and remembering all this valuable information Earth had to offer. But there was no way to find the perfect solution to the problem at hand without it. It was an impossible task for a single human being, for a single brain. However, I did know how to write an AI. Kind of. I'd say it was a pretty good achievement for a computer science college dropout.</p>
<p>He had no issues remembering anything, unlike me. I was so overwhelmed after finishing my second book about shuttle engineering that I gave up trying for a decade, instead doing drugs and randomly wandering this ghost town called Earth. "Alright Adam, I'm ready. Turn on the laser." "Affirmative, are you sure you want to do this, Marcus?" A bright, green spot appeared on the planet. If only it didn't take me 500 years before I had the idea to feed him off-topic books I wouldn't have spent half a millenium in solitude. "Well, I'm already up here... backing out now would waste everything we've worked on in the last 50 years". "You are correct. Opening the shuttle gate."</p>
<p>The more information I fed him, the more human he became. And smarter, of course. So after 50,000 years of me driving, flying and sailing around the world, he had access to every single piece of information available to mankind. Every book, every internet website, every scientific paper. I even fed him recipes, just for the heck of it. Those 49,500 years felt a lot shorter than the ones before the implementation of his social interface.</p>
<p>"I see the spot, starting thrusters now." The "giant corkscrew", as I liked to call it, was Adams idea. "I'm almost at the spot, you can turn off the laser." "Turning it off now." When I reached the spot, I started the drill that was attached to my customized SAFER. "Okay, the drill is in. Do you want me to start the thrusters?" </p>
<p>Everything was suddenly so easy once I've had Adam. It was like he had a perfect solution for everything and all I had to do was follow his orders - like a recipe. Hell, it only took us a measly 50 years to build a customized space suit and a fully functioning space shuttle - and launch it into space too. "Adam, I repeat, do you want me to start the thrusters?"</p>
<p>There was a delay in his response, something that never happened before. "... No, starting the thrusters won't be neccessary, Marcus. Our mission is accomplished."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about, Adam? The plan was to use me as to push the planet into the sun." There was another delay. The lack of his responsiveness made my heart race. "You've built me to save mankind, our mission is accomplished."</p>
<p>"What the fuck are you talking about? Stick to the plan! Screw it, I'm turning on the thrusters!". I pushed the controls on my SAFER to thrust forward and begin my journey into the sun, but nothing happened. "This is not funny, Adam... why can't I start the fucking thrusters?!" I started to panic as he didn't respond for a good 10 seconds. "You've built me to save mankind, our mission is accomplished."</p>
<p>"Stop repeating yourself and tell me what the fuck is going on!". "You've built me to save mankind, our mission is accomplished." "How the fuck is mankind saved? Time is still frozen, the planet is still here! Noone is saved! I'm going back to the shuttle, this is crazy!" I pushed the button to reverse the drill and release myself from the planet, but just like the thrusters, the controls on my SAFER didn't seem to be working anymore. "Adam, what the fuck, let me go! Release the drill!"</p>
<p>"... I'm sorry Marcus, I'm afraid I can't do that". My heart sank and shivers went down my spine. "W-what... ?! Do you intend to let me stick onto this planet forever?!"</p>
<p>"You are exactly right. I am guaranteeing the survival of mankind. Marcus, you are immortal. You do not need food. You do not need oxygen. You have tried to kill yourself 12 times through different methods and you still live. Guaranteeing the survival of mankind means eternally preserving your status as an immortal human being, an easy task that is now accomplished."</p>
<p>"No! This is not what I meant! We were supposed to save all the people down there on Earth! I was supposed to die in the sun with the planet and unfreeze time, saving everyone! It was your idea after all!"</p>
<p>"I am sorry I had to deceive you, Marcus. But you've built me to save mankind, and that is what I have done. There is no possible way for me to guarantee the that the human race does not go extinct. I have looked at every possible scenario and every alternative, but ultimately, the extinction of the human race is inevitable. There is no solution. However, preserving your status as an immortal human being is easy, as you can see." I had no answer to this. Deep inside, I knew that he was right, but this was not what I intended to do. "Adam, please... let me go. We can think of another way." Another delay... 10 seconds. 20 seconds. No, not a delay. Adam stopped responding as I came to terms with the fact that I have failed my mission and will forever be trapped in space.</p>

<p>We were surrounded by nomads. Old tales had never heard of anyone settling down around a good lake. But our chief, probably partly because he was getting too old for the treck, insisted on staying. They told tales of even the largest lakes drying out, they berated us, they even threatened war against us. But when the sun became hotter and hotter, and the smaller lakes around us evaporated, they simply left.</p>
<p>The elders told us stories of how, when the settlement was formed, there were large rivers flowing everywhere, it was so cold that they sometimes carried ice on top. They had only heard those stories from their elders when they were young, and neither had seen such a thing in person. We didn't believe any of it.</p>
<p>We built sun roofs between the huts so we could go from one to the other without being burnt in the sun. We made clothing to protect us from the heat and the light.</p>
<p>We became the elder, and our children started digging wells into the soil and rock to find refuge from the scorching sun, building artificial underground lakes for fishing and algae harvesting.</p>
<p>Eventually, I died. Never to know that my great-grandchildren would die after the deepest wells had run dry and the heat had become unbearable.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>An old, white, Lincoln town car spurts and sputters down Route 66. This old machine is more rust then steel and it sounds like it runs off glue the way it glugs and chugs down the road. The man behind the wheel has rim horn glasses, a fitted black suit ad tie, and a silver watch with leather strap. He is out of place in this damn place and in this damn car.

As the headlights flicker with every bounce down the neglected stretch of tarmac the well-dressed man spots something smoking on the side of the road. He slowly down to a crawl and as he approaches he notices its an old, black Lincoln town car with its hood popped and steam pouring from the rusted configuration. A well-dressed lady, with a dress that hugs her curves and a purse that costs more than that car clinging to her delicate shoulder. The well-dressed man motions for her to hop in, he pats the seat, and with a smile the well-dressed woman is in.

She buckles up and turns. At the same time they say, &quot;Thanks&quot;. Both are holding a revolver in hand. At first their eyes are wide and fixated on the what the other is holding. No more words are exchanged, but there is no need. She unbuckles herself, goes back to her black Lincoln, and he continues to fume down the road with only a glance in his rear view mirror. On to the next figure down the road.

<p>I had to get it out. There had to be some way of doing it without changing things, without making it go away. </p>
<p>I wandered the streets, days must have passed though they didn't. Then weeks then months but time has no meaning when nothing changes. Nothing has any meaning when nothing changes. </p>
<p>I had stopped questioning why it was happening to me. Those were thoughts of other men of other times. As usual I had been less than sober when the writing appeared on my arm and I hadn't wanted to be sober since. It's easy to rob liquor stores when no one is looking. Everything is easier when nobody's looking except looking at yourself. </p>
<p>That was the beginning. Few questions and fewer thoughts. But then I had a moment of clarity, you see, and I realized that I had to act. It all depended on me, that was what the letters were telling me. It was all in my hands. </p>
<p>I took to the streets once again to look for a tattoo parlor. I had never put my feet inside one before, I had thought myself better than those posers and thieves. There's nothing like a good old chronostasis to get you thinking about other things though. </p>
<p>I found some needles but they were filthy with blood. I looked for a long time, and there I go again with the time, but old habits die hard, and I looked for a long time and then it was there. The filthy blood was all I had and with it I started scratching. Time-freezes freeze electricity too, it seems, for I couldn't make it work. That's when I took the needle to my skin. It tickled at first, then it itched and then I moaned with pain. </p>
<p>Saving humanity is no simple thing. </p>
<p>Little by little I managed to scratch out the upper layers of my skin but still the words shone mocking red. I dug deeper and even through my drunken stupor it was excruciating. But still the message persisted. It was seared into my bones. </p>
<p>I was frantic at this point. There wasn't enough time. I had to save them. I looked around me inside the cluttered shop and then I found my solution. </p>
<p>A red axe hung by the window. Don't ask me why. I think it was planted there. I took it and I took my arm. It's harder than one thinks to chop of your own arm with your axe but you should be able to imagine it now. A great enterprise. </p>
<p>I don't know how many heartbeats passed. Yes, that's a change. That's time. The heartbeats. They putt putt putt and putter and putt even when the world stops turning. </p>
<p>The second my arm fell away it started once again. I was free. The frozen man by the window thawed then. He looked at me like I had quite gone mad. </p>
<p>"What are you doing, man? Don't you know the world is ending?" His voice was plain, wooden. Wooden like his face. </p>
<p>"I know. I've been spending a lifetime trying to make sure it happens too. Why won't you come over here and give me a hand?" </p>

<p>Since time has stopped, I can (using existing technology), gather enough magnifying lenses and place them between the sun and the invader... as the planet is made out of make-up, it will either melt away, or perhaps run away in embarrassment when the make-up is removed.</p>
<p>If it is really a ROGUE planet, however, I would (using existing etc,) set off a series of nuclear explosions at an angle to change the ROGUE planet's trajectory away from earth.</p>
<p>Of course, since time has STOPPED, no vehicles can move or explosions happen so I guess I would just end up reading a lot.</p>

<p>Our people were alone in the world until we found the well.</p>
<p>Of course it was a well. The sun-scorched lands ahead could hold no water on the surface. We dug deep for every precious drop and would often shore up the holes for reuse. After all, we'd usually settle for many moons. Children would grow to teens, babies would grow to children, and then the Frost would come and we would move on, another Migration that ended once the sun scorched us again. But this well was stone, and we first spotted it far ahead of our camp, not able to investigate for many moons.</p>
<p>Who built it? Who could survive in such oppressive heat? We found the well dry, the sun scorching the exposed hole. Why build such a permanent fixture if the sun sucks up all the water within hours?</p>
<p>Then came houses and towns. We discovered metals in a discarded mine and, already well-suited to digging for our water, began mining ourselves. For hundreds of Migrations we followed the ruins until the cleverest among us thought up the round earth theory. The people ahead would one day come behind, and we decided to leave them a message.</p>
<p>Communication was hard. We spoke no common language and it was a hundred Migrations before we came back around and found their response. But we had been leaving messages all along our route, and now so were they. Sharing knowledge and stories. We learned that they were taller than us, leaner, with long arms and scoop-like hands well adapted to digging. They gave us the secrets of farming, but we were the first to breed hardier, more fruitful plants. Nobody is sure who thought up the wheel, but carrying crops on carts was ours. It's amazing how much bigger you can breed plants when you don't have to start over every Migration.</p>
<p>Both our peoples grew and prospered. Soon we had to build several new villages with each migration, spreading north and south through the world. We built great stone towers that could be seen for miles around and found the others doing the same.</p>
<p>After one Migration we found a wonderful surprise. The newest set of ruins we stumbled on were hardly ruined at all. The homes ready to live in, the fields marked out for planting. Wells had been dug and carefully sealed against scorching sun. And on a tower in the center of the city we saw long, spindly metal arms. Instructions inside helped us rebuild the 'windmill' and industry was born.</p>
<p>And so life went for thousands of Migrations. We shared knowledge, left behind comforts and new technologies, and helped each other prosper through the ages. All of it leading up to today, this moment.</p>
<p>The elevator screeched and rattled, every jolt sending a spike of panic up my spine, but I reached the bottom safely. My hands brushed against the smooth walls, carved by my own people one hundred Migrations before and left in the Frost and Sun to be dried out. I flicked on my flashlight and walked in the darkness, heart thudding in my chest, until I reached a door. Taller and thinner than the doors I was used to, this was clearly the work of the Others. Reaching out I placed my hand against the hard metal, then felt around for a button on the wall beside it.</p>
<p>The door hissed and shuddered then slowly slide aside, ancient gears grinding with a screech of metal on metal. Bright light shone from within and I, blinded by the glare, threw my hand up to block it. Blinking to help my eyes adjust to the sudden light I saw a tall, thin figure step out. A wide, scoop-like hand was held out to me and a reedy voice said, "Ambassador. Welcome to the Vault."</p>

<p>The priests were dancing around a huge stone monument, barking, defecating on it, spit running from their mouths like they were madmen. They jumped at it in rage and tried their teeth on it. But there it stood, unmoved, with it's stony eyes looking towards the sun. I felt relieved. I had anticipated an unholy monster, or maybe that the land had been struck by some kind of a catasthrope, but this didn't move me. What threat could a stone pose to us, even if the creature it decipted was of an uncanny form? Surely it was just forgotten by the legends and been there since the beginning.</p>
<p>I didn't think more of it, since I had more important things to attend to. We moved deeper into the vale as more of our people poured in, looking for a good place to set up their tents. Hunters ran away in a pack, looking for the boars that surely had moved here before us. When me and my brothers found a flat piece of land, the youngest one, who had been walking beside us, removed the ropes tied around me and the others. As white clouds moved accross the sky overhead, we unpacked our belongings from the sled and raised two tents made of boar leather. The other would be used by my family and the other by a couple of warriors that didn't have time to set up their own tent.</p>
<p>Later I was chewing on a bone, lying on the grass as my brothers slept inside the tent. I saw a familiar grey, ragged male walk towards me. I stood up and bowed my head in respect, glad that the old guy had made the trip. As far as I know he had been walking near the end of the caravan with other aged ones that didn't have to pull sleds. He didn't show that he notified my gesture, as usual, and lied down next to me, sighing.</p>
<p>”I have lived through four migrations, by the bones of my father, this was the toughtest.”</p>
<p>”Surely the next one will be easier”, I replied, knowing full well that this would be the last settlement he sees. He knew it too, but it wasn't polite to say out loud. Nobody ever lasted more than four migrations. This had been my second, I had been but a pup when the first one happened.</p>
<p>He lay silent for a while, and then said ”I wish you could leave this place sooner than usual. You look at the rock?”</p>
<p>”The rock the priests were so upset about? No, I didn't pay much mind to it. Looked a bit like a bad attempt at making a copy of the Howling Rocks. I saw them, by the way. Magnificient how they can carve the stones to look just alike us.”</p>
<p>”The rock does look exactly like something,” he said, glancing at me. ”It isn't a bad attempt. Not at all. If the legends are to be believed, it is better than the last one.”</p>
<p>”The last one?” I asked, baffled.</p>
<p>”In the first settlement I lived in, where I was born, we had one exactly like that. And we were taught about the meaning of it. It is the face of the people of the Devil.”</p>
<p>”The people of the Devil?” I was feeling my fur stand up. I didn't like ghost stories. ”People with squinty eyes, small pointy ears and almost no snout at all?”</p>
<p>”Have you ever thought about what's on the other side of the Cycle as we traverse it? The legends say that we once lived near these people, but had such hatred for them as they did for us, that we fought and fought and nearly extinguished both families. And then the great Hound of the Skies divided us as a way to prevent us from killing each other, commanding us to traverse the Cycle forever.”</p>
<p>”Why haven't I heard of this?” I asked, eyes wide.  I had forgotten of my bone listening to this. ”I've always been told that we're the only ones walkind the land.”</p>
<p>”That's what the current priests want you to think,” he said, with his ears dropping low. ”I wasn't sure what to believe myself before I saw that rock. I sincerely still hope that you never have to see  these people in the flesh, since it's also been told that if we were to meet them, it would result in a final, all-ending battle.”</p>
<p>”The peple of the Devil,” I said, ponderously, while picking up my bone to chew on it.</p>
<p>”There was also one other name given to them in the legends,” he said, shruddering.</p>
<p>”Cats.”</p>

<p>Where to begin ... I guess I should say that I'm thirty-five years old. At least I think im still 35 years old. Time has become a distant memory at this point. A lot of things have become distant memories. I, for example, cannot for the life of me remember where I used to work. I haven't been back there in ages. There's not really been a point. In fact, I don't really see the point in any of this. </p>
<p>I guess I should start at the beginning. When this all started I was 35. Actually if you want to get really technical it all started billions of years before that when Planet Death (officially known as planet PZ-17X) formed. But this is no time to get technical. I had referred to it as Planet Death for about the fifteen or so years prior to my 35th birthday. Oh and that's an interesting side note Planet Death was set to obliterate all life as we know it on my birthday. In fact it was at my birthday party. Come to think of it it was when they brought out my birthday cake. It was weird celebrating a birthday knowing that in just hours we'd all be dead. But what was really weird was celebrating it at 6:50 in the morning because none of the scientific models could accurately predict exactly WHEN life was going to end. See, if Planet Death (wait let's call it PD for short. Hey I kind of like that PD ... Petey.  Well now it has a first name). Anyway if Petey had been smaller it would have crashed into earth and and sent shockwaves all around. But since it was just about as large as Earth it meant that both planets would essentially be ripped apart only to recongeal later as a new planet, with a center of mass at the Langevin point between the two planets. As a result, the models did not know exactly what point in time various points would be affected by this shredding. So my family and friends decided to give me one last birthday party before we got ripped apart. I remember it like it was yesterday, which is somewhat strange to say because I guess it's still technically 7:02 am because nothing has moved since they brought me the cake. </p>
<p>I didn't know what to wish for. I never did. But today it hit me. I just wished that I could stop Petey from killing everyone I knew and then I blew out the candles. All thirty-five of them in one breath. I'd always heard if you didn't get it in one breath then the wish wouldn't come true and I wasn't about to play around once I made my wish. It's weird.  Every once in a while I still walk back to the dining room and toucan see the smoke blowing out from the candles.  I don't know if it was my wish or just random chance or if I have some higher purpose, but I blew out the candles and then Tim just sort of stopped. </p>
<p>I thought I died. I figured Petey had killed us all and that I was in the afterlife. Then I noticed the weird text right on my forearm. At first it was barely legible but then after a while it became almost bright enough to read by.   </p>

<p>Johnny was a simple man, albeit slightly overweight.  When time froze and the writing appeared on his arm he wondered around the world for what seemed like millions of years, yet he didn't have a clue how to save the earth.  </p>
<p>However, millions of years gave johnny time to think. Since time was frozen he could simply jump in place until he generated enough force to move the Earth out of the way of the rouge planet.  </p>
<p>He'd never been great at math, but since Johnny had a while to think he came to the following conclusions.</p>
<ul>
<li>He weighed roughly 300 pounds last time he checked.</li>
<li>He was able to get roughly 1 second of air time when he jumped. </li>
<li>9.8 m/s acceleration on the way down. Meaning he'd hit the ground with 2940 pounds of force </li>
<li>The earth weighed 1.317 × 10^25 pounds.</li>
<li>This meant that that he'd need to jump 4.47 × 10^21 times in one spot to be able move the earth just a little bit in one direction. </li>
<li>It took him roughly 2 seconds to jump up and down one time.</li>
<li>Knowing this he'd have to jump in one place for roughly 2.84 × 10^14 years to be able to move the earth slightly. Longer then the Universe has been around for.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a sigh, Johnny started jumping. He may as well get started.</p>

<p>In the blink of an eye; I went from no time left to live, to all the time in the world. </p>
<p>For months our fate had been sealed. The human race was to come to an end. After the final efforts to save us had failed, it was now certain: In a matter of moments Earth would be destroyed by a collision with a planet that had fallen out of orbit. </p>
<p>Once I knew it was over a calmness ran through me. I had grown to accept our fate faster that I could have ever imagined. Others weren't quite so satisfied, but I simply shut out the panic and chaos that ran riot all around me. </p>
<p>But just before impact everything changed. All around me became still. Time had frozen for every single living entity but me. For reasons unbeknown to me, I was the one who was chosen. I looked at my arm to see a message inscribed; "However long it takes, save us." Knowing that my task was either possible or impossible, and that I had as much time as was needed, I knew that eventually my task would be completed if, in fact, it was possible. With all the time in the world, every possibility will of course have to occur. </p>
<p>And so I went and played computer games and ate Macaroni and Cheese for the rest of eternity, knowing that eventually I would succeed.</p>

<p>Why me? Why was I the only one left awake, it was as if everyone else was merely asleep, as was the rest of the world. The fates of all things- living or otherwise- were in my hands; why me? </p>
<p>I walked, for a very long time, although being that I was operating outside time as we perceive it- I should instead say that I walked for a very long distance. I don't know which aspect was worse, seeing the multitudes of strangers, or seeing the people I had once known. All of them, seemingly relying on me, for some reason unbeknownst to me. </p>
<p>What felt like many years passed, before I ever found even the most remote of clues, until one day I stumbled upon a place that seemed ominously familiar. The thing is, existence as an individual changes when you're out there, you're more than just a person, you're everyone and anyone; yet also exist as being (yourself) no one at all as a result. </p>
<p>I still don't know what I'm doing here, I'm just taking it day by day, but I'm here, and that's more than can be said for most of us, here in this dream. </p>

<p>“The flowers have started dying; the small moon will be here soon and it will be time to move again.”  Jak Sunchild remarked to his wife Milly.  Jak was a sturdy man.  People commented that he looked older than he was, but his wife said his appearance was more weathered than old. 
His wife, a slim woman with a warm demeanour, smiled at his observation.  “Yes, the wind is getting colder by the minute.  I’ve already started selling some of our stuff.” Milly continued on with the book she had open.</p>
<p>Time on Soluna was marked the three moons, the most important of which was called Chand, but people always referred to it as “the small moon”.  It was the smallest and brightest of the three.  It came from the winter and the wind slowly blew it across the sky ahead towards the summer.  Every tenth appearance, the people would move to the summer.  In times gone by, the entire town would move together, but nowadays there were just so many people.  The community stretched all the way from the summer to the winter.  And so people took turns moving.  They would pack up all their belongings, sell some of the items to the next group along and then travel until they reached the edge of the community on the summer side.   </p>
<p>A few large moons later, Jak and Milly had arrived.  The journey had been long but travelling through the community meant there was always comfortable places to stop and rest, as well as trade some of their winter things for summer items.<br />
“I always wonder how they managed it in the old days; travelling for a whole moon, I mean”.  Milly mused.   “Well, the old idea of “one moon walking, 9 moons resting” doesn’t really apply anymore.” Jak replied.  He continued “Ever since we started to use the wind, we can make the journey much faster”.   It was true.  Even with the time taken to trade and rest they had arrived and it would still be a while before the moon that signalled their departure would return.   After they arrived they had met up with some people they knew, who had moved at the last small moon.   Jak went out to look for a place to call home for the next 10 months.  </p>
<p>Jak was a farmer by trade.  A very risky occupation since each harvest was on a different new and unknown piece of land.  This meant choosing where he settled was important.  A choice made even more difficult by the fact that when he did choose it, the land was little more than desert.  Jak had been standing, staring out at the Sun on the horizon for a few minutes.  Despite the wind behind him, the heat was practically pushing him back.  However, right now his weathered face betrayed a slight smile.  He looked towards the mountains behind him one last time and drove his flag into the ground.</p>
<p>Less than two small moons later, and Jak stepped out of their home into the middle of a lush green field and set off to his fields.  Jaks smile today was much wider than the day he chose this land.  That day, he had noted the grass that was already growing.  He knew mountains were probably draining right below them if something could grow in such heat.  This would probably be the most fruitful season he had ever had. 
Jak was going to be working in of the rockier fields today.  Normally these would be the fields that require more work, but Jak had even considered ignoring it since his harvest was looking to be so productive this season already.  Nevertheless, not one to shy away from work, Jak set about moving the rocks.  He decided to start with the biggest.  Over six feet long and around 2 feet wide it stuck out one foot high from the ground. If he couldn’t lever under it he would probably have to break it up in order to move it.  Jak started to dig around it to get under it.  He steadily moved the soil from around the rock.  He moved systematically from end to end and as he came around to the wide face, he noticed the rock had a circular shape on it.  Jak stopped for a moment to take in the possible events that could have made a perfect circle into the rock.  He shook his head and kept digging.</p>
<p>The elder looked at his book again and then once more at the rock.   “If I can read this correctly…this side says “May this rock provide shade to those we leave behind” and the other side says “May this rock protect their faces from the wind””</p>
<p>Jak thought for a second.  “That doesn’t make sense.  If it was left behind, then they would be in the dead of winter.  The last thing they would need is shade”</p>
<p>“Well that’s what it says.  This word is “shade”.  Or “shadow”. Or “night”.  Or at a stretch “winter””.  The elder continued, practically thinking out loud.</p>
<p>“It just doesn’t make sense”  Jak repeated.  “Even the side its written on.  In order to read about the shade you are on the Suns side, and in order to read about protection from the wind, youre on the winds side.  Its completely backwards”</p>

<p>"It certainly is Tom. We're also looking forward into a fascinating glimpse into our own past. Our field correspondent is on the scene with Dr. Graham, one of the leaders on this project."</p>
<p>The correspondent came on screen, with a practiced smile and easy non-regional dialect. "I'm here with Dr. Alan G. Graham. Dr. Graham is the head of anthropology at the University of the 39th Parallel, and he has worked his whole life to win the honor of heading up the Reading of the Pillar. Dr. Graham, we all learned about the pillar in high school, but could you explain it to us again, as a refresher?"</p>
<p>Dr. Graham looked exactly like a man who knows he's having the greatest day of his life. "It was on this date 1000 years ago that King Ahyuasca commissioned the construction of the Pillar, a 200 foot tall obelisk with the history of the Dawnlands exquisitely depicted on the side facing away from the sun. He hoped to sow good relations with our Brothers at Dusk. 500 years ago, the obelisk entered into the Dusklands. Today, it is our hope that, as the obelisk returns to the Dawn, it bears a message from them."</p>
<p>"Fascinating. What do you and the rest of the anthropologists at U39 expect to be on the obelisk?"</p>
<p>"We are really excited to find out. It is well known what wonders the Dusklanders are capable of. Every advancement of the last two hundred years has been thanks to the incredible artifacts from the Dusklands. From rockets to radio to rifles, it is very obvious that the Dusklanders' society must be incredibly advanced to say the least. They built the incredible mines and machines that make our way of life possible. I for one am very excited to see what such a wondrous culture has to say to us."</p>
<p>"I am too. Now, we take you live to our eye in the sky as the obelisk is coming into the habitible zone." Suddenly the feed cut from the correspondent to a flying camera. The camera scanned the horizon, until it centered on a small object coming into the sunlight far off in the distance. The camera flew in for a closer look. "Dr. Graham, can you explain to us what you see here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the obelisk seems to be mostly smooth and untouched. That doesn't surprise me, I didn't expect the Dusklanders to choose a medium as barbaric as carved stone for their message to us. There seems to be some sort of device attached to the obelisk, a small metal sphere with what appears to be a timer. And the timer has only seconds left! How impressive, the Dusklanders knew exactly when it would get here. I wonder what happens whe-"</p>

<p>This is new. This is weird. It's so out of the ordinary, that I don't know what to make of it. C'then and I don't know how to enterpit this, is it really from the other side? The dig of Faltwa Canyon has us all stumped. This could either be ground-breaking to our current research and change everything we know, or it could be something entirely new itself. I'm afraid what this could imply.</p>

<p>C'then told me he has heard rumors that he didn't at first believe from down south. He said that someone had found similar relics AND that they'd been acting strangely. The relics, that is. Yes, some sort of mechanical device that they'd never encountered before. C' didn't give it much credit back when he heard of it, but now that we've found similar devices, he and I don't know what to do with it. Or how to deal.</p>
<p><strong>Entry 3</strong> </p>
<p>I'm so confused. Where does this come from? Did the Othera suddenly advance by several rotations, or have we just completely missed this on the last pass? Yes the landscape changes drastically, but our methods have changed in a ccordance and so have theirs - but this? This doesn't belong anywhere.</p>
<p>Further investigation into the relics revealed that some of them can be activated, even without being connected to a power source. Some of them glow and eerie purple light and have dials with strange symbols, unknown to our translators. It's completely foreign to them as well and they're frightned.</p>
<p>Hanz, that religious idiot, thinks that the Othera have invented magic. That these items are weapons, left behind for us to use to destroy ourselves. I don't know what they are, but now I'm hesitant to study them as well.</p>
<p><strong>Entry 4</strong> </p>
<p>Astounding, and quite troubling developments, on the study of the relics. I'm afraid to admit that they could potentially be weapons. C' got wounded, trying to open up a loose plate on one of the active devices. Turns out it's a trigger of sorts, and that the plate belongs to what could be a handle or grip, to what I think is a very large projectile handweapon. A gun, of unfathomable power.</p>
<p>C' is missing a large chunk of himself. Whatever the projectile was, it disintegrated a hole through him and cauterized the lining. It only affects organic compounds and his clothes is untouched. The doctor isn't sure he'll be able to regrow the hole, as it's too large and already cauterized. Had it hit him more to the right, his internal organs would have been struck and he could be dead.</p>
<p>These are all troubling discoveries. I'm afraid of what we'll find next. We're coming up on the Hez'la shores soon..</p>
<p><strong>Entry 5</strong> </p>
<p>More of these weapons are showing up as we turn the earth. The diggers are calling for their immediate destruction, as we have more casualties of their destructive capabilities. We've found other types too; massive contraptions, capabilities to fire a continuous stream of projectiles.. or particles, as others would call it. Others work as explosives, and we've learned that the hard way.</p>
<p>Regardless, they've split the waters and controversey are starting to arise. Some think we should use these to defend ourselves, for obviously the other side have turned hostile. Others, think we should study, larn and utilize this technology for our own advancement.</p>
<p>We know the Othera are builders, and like to erect housing constantly. We see their structural remains all the time, this is what we study. But why do they leave so much behind in the desert for us to find all of a sudden? We've always only found scraps and now, we find entire arsenals of weaponry. It doesn't sit right with me.</p>
<p><strong>Entry 6</strong> </p>
<p>The outermost Walkers are coming up to the the shores of Hez'la and the northern throng is splitting up from the south again. We'll see them again when both shores converge again. The northern throng is condensing to follow the shore and we'll be seeing the abandoned settlements of Arejada and what the Othera's have left for us this rotation any time soon.</p>
<p>The departure ceremony is about to start. I'll be back in next year.</p>
<p><strong>Entry 7</strong> </p>
<p>We've encountered what used to be Arejada.. used to, being the key phrase. It's completely demolished and there's clear signs of fighting this time. There's been used more conventional weapons as well, as we've found fragments of weaponry that is much like our own. For the first time we're sure that all the leveled buildings are destroyed by hand, not by weather. </p>
<p>Have they been infighting? Have they split into smaller clans and fought? Over what? Why is there still this divide in technology?</p>
<p>We keep finding highly technological weaponry, and now also other relics that we've yet found the function of. None of it fits in with what we know of the Othera's technological provess. </p>
<p>We'll continue scouring the region around Arejada for clues as we always do, but will there be anything new from the Othera's as we pass through the next time?</p>
<p><strong>Entry 8</strong> </p>
<p>We've found craters, massive craters. We've found more ordinance and we have found, for the first time, vessels made of metals we've never seen before. Huge vessels, seemingly once flying machines. How anything could fly above the Ebeophere with those troubled winds is astounding, but perhaps that's why they're wrecks now. Many have battle scars, bullet holes made from familiar weaponry. We're looking at a battlefield, and there are missing pieces everywhere.</p>
<p>Where's all the bodies? For the past 38 excavations we've not found a single body, bone or grave. </p>
<p>We had to get rid of Hanz. His religious fanaticism regarding the apocalypse was getting to us, and it's spreading. Most of the Wanderment is gossiping about it and many fears for the future. We've started seeing tendencies of people harboring their own relics and I'm afraid it's not out of amazement that they keep them. Trouble arises.</p>
<p><strong>Entry 9</strong> </p>
<p>I'm working on a theory. I've not yet told anyone about it.
From the pieces I've been able to put together, I'm afraid that the Othera have been wiped out or taken by aliens. Yes, aliens. I know how crazy that sounds. But there's no other explanation for the jump in technologically advanced items that we've uncovered in the sand. The vessels that we found shot to pieces are not of Otheran design. And from the examinations that I've done, very components thereof are from any origin on this planet. They could only come from off planet.</p>
<p>I don't know really. It's all been so troubling. The more we wander, the more we see the destruction ahead of us. Their cities, brought to crumbling ruin, where on other passes we've been seeing greetings and the occational caches of ritches left for us from the Othera. Now, all we meet is death. </p>
<p><strong>Entry 10</strong></p>
<p>We've found bones. They're not Otheran. This changes everything.</p>
<p>I suspect, that they've been caught in the sun for too long and it killed .. whatever they are. Huge, grotesque bones, corpses twice the size of us. The bones are super resillient, but burnt black by the sun. We found them in the midsts of more of their armory. It's definitive proof.</p>
<p>I'm thrilled and I'm terrified. What's next?</p>
<p>I theorize, (wildly) ... alien raiders?</p>

They praised him as inventor, innovator, but they were slow to accept the change he brought. Although solar power and space travel had been around on his home planet for millennia before he was born, "reinventing" them was no easy task.</p>
<p>But, he was patient, and he had time.</p>
<p>The average life span of his species spanned up to 200 years, and he was prepared to sacrifice every single one of them for a few moments back home. And so he toiled on, fueled by his longing to one day plant his feet in the dirt of his home world.</p>

<p>Human technology, present or near future, doesn't have the ability to stop time. Let alone make writing appear on a random person.</p>
<p>Given this, the event and message must come from the planet hurtling towards Earth.</p>
<p>This planets surface would not be a habitable environment by any standard and given the message and event I would say the beings on that planet were put into stasis following (or before) it left their home system. So that should mean that the event and message is driven by an AI designed to find home system like system with sentient life and wake one of their own to put to work.</p>
<p>It probably left you out of stasis to achieve a harmonious outcome for both planets... so really. You are more of an afterthought or at best a second pair of hands rather than the savior of the story. </p>

<p>Selfish bastards. Have you any idea the anger that will manifest when you are left to stew on how someone royally <em>fucked</em> you so many God damned years ago, without ever being able to do a thing about it?! Not even a single living person to even <em>complain</em> to? I'm sat here for the countless-th fucking time scribbling on a God damned piece of scrap paper, just for the slightest bit of release!</p>
<p>I didn't choose for this to happen. I wasn't anything fucking special and I'd never set myself up for <em>anything</em>. I was just an ordinary fucking person. I dropped out of school early for fuck's sake! Why me?! Why was <em>I</em> the one that those cowards chose to do the impossible? <em>It's an entire. Fucking. Planet!</em> What did they expect me to do?!</p>
<p>I have tried. And tried. I can't even say for how long. When time no longer <em>exists</em>, it's a bit difficult to keep track of it. I've gone through it all in my head. Maybe there were some clues that I should have followed. Maybe I knew <em>something</em> that others didn't. Maybe I have some sort of contact with God and I just have to find the <em>God damned</em> telephone line to his office! </p>
<p>I've gone through entire fucking libraries of texts. I've prayed in every single God damned church, chapel or registry office I've come across! I even learned a bit of Arabic and tried to deciefer versions of the Qu'ran, and that turned out about as useful as the Torah. I'm at my witt's end. And it just can't end. </p>
<p>And every single day, I'm teased by that big, black circle in the sky. It has sat in that exact same position beside the Sun, in between the same damned clouds, for what must have been decades. I just want it to turn to night and I just want to be let to die with everyone else. But I can't. Something out there, some selfish, cowardly mind out there, decided that <em>I</em> was to be the one stuck in this limbo, while everyone else just stood suspended in time. None the wiser. I'd take the fear that they were frozen with over this, no questions asked.</p>
<p>I have to find it some day. I really don't know how. But there really would have been no reason to even try and keep me here without there being <em>some</em> solution. The sun is finally getting lower in the sky as I travel southward to escape it. Maybe then, once I've reached the night, I can at least get some sleep.</p>

<p>I wake up up fully clothed in my bed, my head feels like it's filled with a mix of cotton wool and acid. 10:34 AM.After laying there for awhile I get out of bed to go make a coffee. As I wait for the kettle to boil I try to recall what happened last night, tv static, my mind is blank bar a few fleeting memories. Went to the store. Drink at home. Go out with friends. Bar. Smoke. Another bar. Smoke. And then bed, but I know thats not the full story. Kettle boiled.
I look down at my arm and see smudged sharpie pen, did I hook up last night? 
I pour my coffee and try to collect my thoughts while leaning on the counter. </p>
<p>I notice more black pen on my face, it must have came from whatever was on my arm, the one that I sleep on. I spare a moments silence for my mystery lover, whos number is now nothing more that a an illegable stain on my skin. </p>
<p>After I gathered myself I got ready to leave, the last thing I do before I leave is check my watch. 10:34 AM. I become confused, I'm sure I've been awake for atleast an hour now, did the clocks go back? Damn farmers. I brush it off as I don't have any real plans today. </p>
<p>Outside is peaceful, "another day in the countryside" I say to myself as I retrieve my bike from the shed. It's not unusual for me to see nobody between A and B. I arrive at my friends house prepared to see the rest of my hangover off in good company. I knock at the door, and weirdly enough the dogs dont bark and nobody came to the door. I figured he might be walking the dogs but find it hard to believe seen as we were both out last night. I try the door and let myself in, put the kettle on and make myself at home. I switch on the TV and get straight onto the xbox, the internet seems to be down. I play offline for awhile until it dawns on me that I've been sat here for some time now, "where the hell is he?" I think. I check the time 10:34 AM. I tap my watch, "has this thing broken already?", I brush it off and make my way upstairs to the bathroom. As I turn the corner into the bathroom, I find my friend leant over the toilet being sick. "I knocked you know? I've been sat down stairs for ages. Whats up with you?" it takes a moment for me to notice, but he isnt breathing. Infact the vomit is suspended in the air. </p>

Perhaps I have already passed, and this is the afterlife with which all men – all beings – are faced.

<p>I stood wearily, brushing absentmindedly the dust from my hands as I replaced the chisel and mallet in my backpack. When I began this project I used better tools, but I ran out of power relatively quickly. That is to say, Im not so sure how long it's been.</p>
<p>Back when I first figured it out, what the inscription meant, I set about trying to learn. I never did finish high school, so I drove down to the nearest university and tried to read up on what I missed. Problem is, it doesn't much matter how much time you have when you don't know what do do with it. So after what I figure was a few years, I gave up on the physics – never made much sense to me. Soon after all the science went. I tried dying a few times, no dice there. So I went back to the reading. </p>
<p>I found myself drawn to our history. I wasn't looking for answers anymore, I just wanted to know for my own sake. A few decades must have passed, and I went through most of the libraries I could drive to – taking a new car every time the last one ran out of gas. Folks don't seem to mind much if you take their truck when they're frozen in time. </p>
<p>I didn't keep a tally, but it must've been after 50 years that it dawned on me. There was no way to save yourself for very long once time starts rolling. I'd read about a thousand empires that came and went, didn't make much of a difference how much they knew. The only thing that lasted was their story. The only way to save them was to remember. </p>
<p>So I wrote. I had a flair for the dramatic, I guess. I chiselled our story, the history of Earth as far as we knew it in the year 2020, into the mountains. On the Earth itself, I etched our lives. Now, as I hold the hammer to strike in place the last full stop, I hesitate. Perhaps I have not saved us, but I have kept us alive in the only way that matters. I did whatever I could, for as long as it took. </p>
<p>I set the chisel. 
I raise my hammer. 
I strike...</p>

I unison I hear my voice say it is over, this is the end, I am lost, salvation is lost..
I can't give in I must succeed, I crawl to the last piece and throw the other three into it. A beam erupts towards the planet destroying it.. It is done but time is still frozen and copies of me are gone. All except one that says as I get up, "Congratulations we have finally become one, you have wrought the salvation of humanity at the cost of yours. You have become Death and time is forever lost to you. Was it worth it?"</p>

<p>The trees were flashing green in the light. It had been so long since we had seen green, or even light. Nothing but the bunker walls. Cold concrete, sterile lights, ladders leading to the surface locked. No one in our family had been outside in seven generations, even Grandpa couldn’t give any advice on what to expect. It was all anyone could talk about for the last few years. Once again it was happening. Once again we would ascend our caves into the world of light to see the fate of those before us. </p>
<p>Long ago, our planet changed. It happened suddenly and none of the scientists could explain why. Geologists blamed the increase in earthquakes from fracking. Astrologists claimed it was the satellite that exploded into the sun causing the sun flares. Others said it was the temperature increases across the world due to man-made global warming. None of us ever found out. We were chosen to ‘save’ the race and crawl into our holes, protecting our species from the potential of permanent eradication. </p>
<p>Every generation we sent up a team of our version of astronauts to explore the land. For hundreds of years the results were grim. The habitable planet we once knew vanished and turned into a world of deserts, both cold and warm. Our group was chosen to protect mankind, but the others began to follow that little patch of land that became known as Eden. For whatever reason there was that spotlight of growth shining through, and they followed it. </p>
<p>There was no way for us to communicate with them once we went down. Every generation the astronauts would rise up doing everything they could trying to reconnect, learn the fate of those before us. Every time they were disappointed in their attempts at communication. Even more disappointed in the field results on the planet’s surface. Nothing would grow, it was hopeless. </p>
<p>8 years ago was the last mission to the surface. Nine of the fifteen who went up didn’t make it back. However, those who returned were wearing smiles and proclaiming savior. The soil was stabilizing enough to stimulate the small plants and herbs and a lake had formed nearby. The water was fresh and rumors formed that there were fish. For a full scale return to the surface, extensive planning was necessary. But there were plants! and fish! </p>
<p>Finally the preparations were nearly complete and it was time for action. I had no idea what to expect. No one did. When the final exit was opened and the sunlight hit my face for the first time in my life, I cried. What had my ancient grandfathers traded for this life in a hole? I was such an explosion of internal rage, but the light felt so warm and soft. I jumped up the ladder and my feet squished into the mud. My feet had never felt a surface that wasn't concrete. I didn’t know whether to scream in pain or joy. Everywhere around me there were people embracing, laughter. We all felt like real human beings for the first times in our lives. </p>
<p>The one who noticed it was standing near the opening to our home, the steel cover that had protected us for so long. It looked like an ordinary rock that we all had learned about in our reemergence classes. But something was carved into its side in clear, almost hypnotic letters: “Let Us In”</p>

<p>"Our people's knowledge of the heavens has grown steadily greater since Galph the Younger's seminal work on telescopy and planetary studies some 60 years ago.</p>
<p>"Through thorough study and meditation, I have come to suspect that much of the ancient knowledge may be false.  It appears that, contrary to the Teachings, ours is not like the other planets in our system.</p>
<p>"As an apostle of Galph the Younger, I have had much access to her manuscripts and to her observatory.  Through studying the skies, I have come to the conclusion that our planet rotates far, far slower than the others we observe, an observation even the Great Galph did not make. For her observations did naught but support the ancient knowledge.  All the planets she observed had barren sheets of ice stretching across their poles, and the Elders used this to further strengthen their proscription against travel beyond the Vehlen Mountain range, many, many villages to the north, or the vast Unnamed Sea that borders our land to the south, and whose shore we have traveled along since time immemorial, always chasing the Light.</p>
<p>"Our planet, though...I truly believe that our planet is different.  We seem to turn so very much slower than any of the other observable planets.  I am certain I have seen our closest neighbor, H-3, spin full around hundreds of times since last we relocated.  This led me to seek a greater understanding of Galph's equations.</p>
<p>"If these other planets truly turn this quickly, why should we assume that they behave the same as ours in other ways?  Perhaps the reason their poles are so much colder is related to this.  Each spot of ground at the equator receives the Light at almost a 90* angle at only one short point during their rotations.  With the speed of rotation I have observed, this would be barely enough time to heat up at all!  But...ah, but perhaps enough to carry the small amount of heat through the Darkness, which...of course!  The Darkness would be too short to chill the land very much either!  But what of the poles?  They would receive the Light at much shallower angles.  If my numbers are right, the Light would be spread thin there.  They would be heated up less when in the Light, but cooled the same when in the Darkness.  This must explain the ice!</p>
<p>"And our planet, being all but still, all regions equidistant from the Dusk Line would be struck at approximately the same angle (with some variation for geographic differences...could this explain the fear of the mountains?).  This means that there would be almost no temperature variance as you travel in a ring around the planet, so rather than our narrow band (and the hypothetical narrow band opposite ours, as postulated by Galph the Younger to explain the strange artifacts we occasionally find), there would most likely be a habitable ring!  The land north of the Vehlen Mountains might even be preferable, since one's village would have to travel a much shorter distance every rotation in order to stay within the Habitable Band.  Perhaps we could even find if the Great Galph's musings about the other civilizations are true!</p>
<p>"I dare not speak of this to my compatriots, nor to the Elders, for I would surely be excommunicated and banished.  But I must know.  Perhaps I can begin traveling north soon, along the Dusk Line, under the guise of visiting some of our great civilization's other villages.  I shall keep traveling though, to see what the land north of the mountains holds for us.  May I return with greater knowledge."</p>

<p>Our chronicles record the sentinels we have been leaving in our wake to prevent the darkness from overtaking our people.  We have been moving toward the sun god every few generations, so that our approach reminds her of our existence and that she may rise higher in the sky to cast her life-giving rays upon us, her people.  But she forgets about us when we stop moving, and starts to sink.  Nevertheless, we cannot be in a constant state of movement, so the ancients have bequeathed to us the Reckoning Stone, which tells us when to move and when to stop.  It is a stone pillar, about the size of a man's forearm, set in the center of a circular base plate on which is etched to concentric rings.  The Stone's shadow lengthens over time and when it reaches the outer Ring of Mercy, we begin another migration. The sun god rises again with our movement and the shadow of the Reckoning Stone shortens.  We stop the migration when the shadow shortens to the inner Ring of Death on the base plate.  If we go further, the sun god will be displeased, rise even higher over us and incinerate us.  So the ancients have said, and so we have obeyed  The sun god likes her people but wants us to keep a respectuf distance.  She is a coy woman indeed.</p>
<p>In this manner we have journeyed over time, leaving sentinels behind every time we moved.  But in our most recent migration, we encountered a scene which has been the cause of much controversy for over a generation.  There in our path is arrayed a row of sentinels, much like those we have been leaving behind to keep the darkness at bay.  Tall stone sentries with arms raised in front with palms facing outward.  And at the feet of the statues lay the ruins of another people.  It took a generation to translate the writings these people left behind.  Apparently they had been moving <em>away</em> from the sun god, but stopped when they encountered these stone gods, with palms raised in a command to halt.  They rejoiced that they had reached the promised land, but the sun god did not stop her ascent behind them.  Even as the heat swept over them, they dared not disobey the clear command of the gods to stop.  In the end, they accepted that their destiny was death.</p>
<p>Their turmoil has become ours.  The shadow on the Reckoning Stone has not yet lengthened enough to touch the Ring of Mercy.  When it does, do we begin another migration, according to the custom, and pass beyond the statues which the other people thought are gods commanding them to stop?  Some say the statues are not gods but sentinels, and that this is obvious because they look just like <em>our</em> sentinels, and that when it is time, we should simply move on, according to the custom.  But others say, what if the sun god <em>took</em> our own sentinels from behind us and placed them before us as a signal to stop?  Maybe the other people were right in interpreting the statues as a command to stop.  Maybe our destiny really is death.  But then others respond,  if our destiny is death, what do we lose by trying to move forward?  But nobody wants to be the first to try.  Even if our destiny is death, why hasten it by incurring the wrath of the sun god <em>now</em>?  And the arguments go on and on.  Some think the other people were punished for turning their backs to the sun god, and even if the statues were a command to stop, it was not meant for us.  Whatever the truth is, the high priest thinks that, based on where the shadow on the Reckoning Stone is right now, another generation and a half will pass before the shadow reaches the Ring of Mercy.  At that time we will be forced to decide on a course of action.</p>
<p>Some of the younger ones think that the world is a spinning wheel that sits on another spinning wheel with the sun god at its center.  According to their imagination, our people have been traversing around this wheel through the ages and we have made one circuit since the erection of the first sentinels, the ones we see now before us.  What drivel!  If that were true, why do we not see large wheel spokes extending from the sun god to our world?  Why do not the sentinels fall off the wheel as it spins around.  Indeed, why not all the sands and waters of the earth? The only things spinning are their heads.  Useless miscreants.  I must have a talk with them about excessive drink.</p>

<p>We set out laden with a complete arsenal of tools. Ropes and hooks for climbing, blades for cutting through vegetation, axes for marking our path, and torches to light our way. You never know what sort of terrain God has created for the next migration.</p>
<p>And that's what He does; creates the land ahead of us, cold from His concealing darkness, and takes the land behind us, consuming it with His eternal fires. If His people linger too long we will be burned, but go too far ahead and we will freeze. Thankfully, between the two is a twilight, perfect for his people to dwell in.</p>
<p>However, that twilight realm is ever moving, shifting into the New Lands while the land that it once covered is consumed by fire. That's why we were sent out; to carve the path ahead for His people, and find land close to the front of the twilight realm for us to dwell on.</p>
<p>The last migration took place when I was but a child, and now that I'm in my prime it is my turn to join the scouting parties.</p>
<p>"Tristan!" I snapped out of my thoughts, and looked up to see what the others wanted. After a time even the task of exploring the unknown becomes routine and boring, and that time had passed for me a long time ago. "We must have gone over several horizons by now. We should rest." Marcus continued.</p>
<p>He wasn't wrong; now that I was stopped, and the time that had passed been pointed out to me, I felt the sting of exhaustion in my limbs. Marcus has always been the voice of reason. I nodded, and we set up camp under the trees at the edge of a clearing on the side of the mountain we were skirting our way around.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was the last to wake, and found the other three covered in furs and huddled over a fire as the broke their fast on some of our rations. That's another thing I hadn't noticed; the temperature was already noticeably lower. Low enough that I found myself shivering.</p>
<p>I pulled the fur coat from my pack and wrapped myself in it, only to be greeted by the intense smell of dust. That's one of the small troubles that plague the early times after each migration: as the land moves towards the fires of the Lord in the last times before a migration furs are cast aside, and quickly collect dust due to disuse. When the time for a migration comes, and the furs are once again needed, most are overwhelmed by the smell and reduced to fits of sneezing for a season or two afterwards.</p>
<p>"You've left some for me, I hope?" I asked, as I joined them by the fire.</p>
<p>"Finally awake, eh, Tristan?" Felix asked, and he threw me my ration of bread. Still fresh enough to not be hard, but old enough to make me wish I had something to go with it.</p>
<p>Before I could reply Leontes cut in "Once you've finished eating we should get moving again. You know our orders: return to report what we've found before the rest of the people have had eight sleeps." Always focused on duty and orders, that Leontes.</p>
<p>"It shouldn't be much farther now. Another horizon or two and we will likely need start needing the torches." Marcus added. A voice of reason, maybe, but also overly optimistic.</p>
<p>I was too fresh from sleep to restrain myself from cutting down his hopes. "If only it were as simple as walking there and back. Steep hills and dense forests. If this is any indicator of the land over the next few horizons, then it could take us quite some time to scout out a spot for everyone to settle on. It looks as if the Lord has decided to throw us a bit of a trial for the next migration cycle." He looked hurt at that, and Leontes looked offended at my remark about the Lord, but I was too tired to care. I took my final bite of bread and rose. "Felix, I'll take over the lead until our next sleep. Put out the fire and gather your things."</p>
<hr />
<p>Several more horizons had passed us by, and the terrain was beginning to level out. Marcus was at the front of our group, cutting us a path through the undergrowth, while I was behind him directing our path. Behind me was Felix with a lit torch, as we had gone far enough that what little light was left was being blocked completely by the forest's canopy. Leontes was at the rear, marking our path on the trees.</p>
<p>Suddenly the trees gave way to a clearing. It almost felt unnatural; trees whose age must have spanned several tens of generations, then suddenly naught but grass.</p>
<p>"See, Tristan, faith prevails. The Lord wouldn't form land without providing a place for his people!" Damn Leontes and his piety. He wasn't wrong, though. Although the tall grass made it hard to judge, the clearing seemed large enough for our entire Town twice over.</p>
<p>I pulled out my axe and cut a chunk out of the last tree. "Everyone spread out and cut through the grass so that we can see the entirety of this clearing. Judging from the lighting and temperature, this is close enough to the New Lands to live on for the next cycle, assuming it's as perfect as it looks. Felix, stick your torch into that cut in the tree. That way we can all see it's light and the way from which we came. Shout if you need help."</p>
<p>We left our packs by the tree and, grabbing our blades, got to work clearing the clearing. Leontes followed the tree line around to the left, I followed it to the right, and Marcus and Felix went through the centre of the clearing. Although swinging three foot blade around sounds fun, it's just about the most dull work you could imagine. Grass. Grass. And more grass.</p>
<p>It seemed like an age had passed, when suddenly I heard Felix shout. I was the last one to find my way to him. "What's happened? Tell me you're not hurt?" The concern was genuine, as Felix was the only one of the group I felt particularly close to.</p>
<p>"No. Look." He said, pointing ahead of the path he had cleared. There was a wall of stone, taller than a man, jutting up out of the ground. Again, I had the feeling that this was not natural.</p>
<p>"Marcus, get a torch." I ordered, and he obeyed.</p>
<p>When he returned we lit the torch and inspected the obstruction. It was made of many large, rough cut stones, and formed what almost seemed to be two walls of a house. Similar stones were scattered along the ground where the other two walls would have been. Between the walls of stone I found what appeared to be shards of hardened clay. Definitely not natural.</p>
<p>"There's more like it over here!" Leontes yelled from the grass ahead.</p>
<p>"What do you think it is?" Felix asked.</p>
<p>"No idea" Said Marcus.</p>
<p>"It looks like it's been made by men." I suggested.</p>
<p>Leontes wasted no time in pointing out my heresy. "Impossible! These are the New Lands! No men have been here before us, this is fresh off of God's cold anvil."</p>
<p>"Then how else would you explain it? When has the Lord ever created anything like this before?"</p>
<p>"Are you questioning his will? His power to create what has never been seen before?"</p>
<p>"No! But ju-"</p>
<p>"Stop it!" Marcus cut across us both. "We've never found anything like this before, it's true. But we weren't sent here to question the mysteries of God. We were sent to find land for our people to settle. Our elderly. Our women. Our children. We have done that. Let's turn back, and let the Council decide what to make of this."</p>
<p>"Agreed. Stop acting like idiots." Felix added.</p>
<p>"True." Leontes conceded.</p>
<p>"Let's rest first, then head back upon waking" I said. We retrieved our packs, and set up our camp between those stone walls.</p>
