	  <h4>[WP] At the age of 18 you are permitted to redistribute your twenty skill points around into whatever skills you want permanently. You decided to put everything into LUCK and leave the rest at 0 points.</h4>
<p>Score: 6120</p>
<p>"That's not a good idea, Ben. For one, we don't have great data on the actual effects of enhanced Luck..."</p>
<p>"Look, can you do it or not? I need this."</p>
<p>The gene tech sighed in the quiet office and swiveled his chair back to the computer. He was looking at a fairly standard representation of a human genome, red highlights in the mass of blue to indicate genes with likely altered function from human baseline and green to indicate potential areas for change.</p>
<p>"Let's see, we have some modifiable options at rs2981205, rs730882133, rs423454-"</p>
<p>"Yeah, man, I get it, lots of fancy words. Bottom line it for me?" Ben shifted impatiently in his chair; flipping his phone from hand to hand.</p>
<p>"Based on population-level studies and retrospective analysis of lottery winners, survivors of freak accidents, etc, there's about 20 genes we could modify in you to try to make you luckier. I'm obligated to point out that we don't know for sure that these genes actually <em>cause</em> better luck, and frankly the latest research is casting some doubts on the validity-"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, I signed the waiver already, do what you got to do; I have a lot riding on this."</p>
<p>"Um, you already made the bet? And you want to get lucky now?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly, I don't really want to explain."</p>
<p>"Whatever, they're your genes. Sign this form here, some more standard stuff. Given the specific genes we need to modify, you are looking at 85% chance for significant loss in strength, 90% chance for loss in fine and gross motor skills, 100% for loss in intelligence, 60% chance for loss in overall body aesthetic and symmetry, and 50% chance for loss in short and long term memory."</p>
<p>Ben, took the tablet, skimming over most of the form. When he had scrolled to the bottom, he pressed his finger on the fingerprint scanner, acknowledging his agreement. He let his shoulders relax afterwards, like a weight had been lifted off.</p>
<p>"Ok then" he said to himself in a quieter voice; "that's settled."</p>
<p>"Not quite, Ben. Given the severity of potential deficits you are required to provide a sperm sample on the chance that you would prefer to have unaltered children in the future. Furthermore, while we strongly suggest implantable birth control for all men and women that undergo elective alteration, per the 2024 SAFEGene act, prior to sexual intercourse with any potentially fertile partners, you both must be screened for possible gene incompatibility."</p>
<p>"Yeah, everyone knows the rules."</p>
<p>"OK, here's your sample cup; I'll give you some time to provide the sample and I'll get the CRISPR transfer virus ready."</p>
<hr />
<p>Ben rolled up his sleeve, exposing a slightly faded tattoo; a simple heart motif with the name "Jess" on it.</p>
<p>"Just a slight poke, then you'll be all set. This is your last chance to change your mind..."</p>
<p>"Get it over with."</p>
<p>"OK"</p>
<p>The tech injected Ben's left deltoid with the modified viral delivery system. Over the next 48 hours, the virus, a modified version of the flu, would infect the vast majority of his cells and re-write all of his DNA.</p>
<p>"It's done. Now, you'll probably have some soreness, fatigue, and a fever for the next couple days, similar to flu symptoms. This virus isn't contagious, but to be safe, you need to avoid the very young and the elderly. Take tylenol if the fever or pain get bad. If you have difficulty breathing, pass out, or anything like that, get to a hospital immediately."</p>
<p>"Got it. Thanks, doc."</p>
<p>"Good luck."</p>
<hr />
<p>Two months later, Ben's life, as far as any outsider was concerned, was pretty much unchanged. He'd had to quit his job as a barista; it was a bit too fast paced for him with his new weakness and difficultly remembering simple tasks. He'd found a perfect job, working at one of the few private libraries remaining in Baltimore. He'd only get one or two customers a day and they were usually older; if anything, Ben found himself getting along better with them than people his own age; the elderly clients seemed to talk and move at the pace he was accustomed to these days.</p>
<p>He settled in well to his new life; he was more lonely than he had been, but that suited him well. He had a new companion, in the form of a stray he named Tipsy, that had wandered up to his feet when he was getting back to his apartment one night. She only had three paws and occasionally fell over, but they were fast friends.</p>
<p>All in all, his life was stable, boring; an easy sort of anguish. And every day, as he left the library, sometimes with Tipsy peeking out of his backpack along with a few children's books; the short ones with the easier words, he would take the 57 bus and transfer to the 23 to get to the long term care facility. There he would take the elevator to the fourth floor, his legs a bit too weak for the stairs, and sit next to Jess, who was perpetually silent except for the occasional hiss and beep of the ventilator, and read to her. Often, he would fall asleep in the chair next to her, dreaming that perhaps tomorrow would be his lucky day, and he would get to talk to her again.   </p>
<hr />
<p>So all of you are ridiculous, amazing people. Thank you for reading and for sharing your thoughts and feedback about the story! Definitely a deeply motivating experience to write more in the future.</p>

<h4>[WP] "Adulthood is like looking both ways before you cross the street, then getting hit by an airplane."</h4>
<p>Score: 5553</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to bring you here like this."</p>
<p>"Not at all, my dear boy. Not at all."</p>
<p>"But, you see, I have to know… I have to know, and you're the only one –"</p>
<p>"I get it," the old man interrupted me. He puffed his cheeks weakly, like it took him great effort just to breathe, 
and then he leaned back against the armchair and his eyes turned to the crackling of the fireplace. "Ask away."</p>
<p>"Well… it's pretty simple, actually." I leaned forward. "What's it like?"</p>
<p>His eyes turned to me, and he almost smiled. <em>"What's it like?"</em></p>
<p>"Yeah. Life. Growing up. Being old." I paused. "Well, not that I'm calling you old, I just –"</p>
<p>"It's okay, dear boy," he laughed. "I am old. That's why you brought me here."</p>
<p>I said nothing. He arranged himself on the armchair like he had all the time in the world. Then his eyes went up to 
me again. "It's… hard."</p>
<p>I waited. I knew he wasn't done.</p>
<p>"It's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do, actually" he continued. "Harder than building all this fancy equipment you've built. Harder than studying all you've studied. Harder than winning all these scientific awards you've won so far." He chuckled. "Nothing prepares you for it."</p>
<p>"What makes it hard?" I asked. "Is it the responsibilities? The body decaying? What makes growing up so hard?"</p>
<p>"No. It's not the responsibilities. Growing up is like looking both ways before you cross the street, then getting hit by an airplane." He lowered his head as if to put his thoughts together, then continued. "It's the things you don't expect that catch you by surprise. Sure, it's scary to have a kid, and to get married, and to ask your boss for a promotion, and all these grown-up stuff we have to <em>pretend</em> we know how to do."</p>
<p>"Pretend?"</p>
<p>He seemed surprised. "Yes, pretend. No one really grows up, of course. We put on a face to the world, but at home, three in the morning, all alone watching TV, you're still sixteen. All of us are." He shook his head. "There's nothing more heartbreaking than being a real person and sitting down in front of another real person, and then both of you have to act like fake people. You sit across from someone two years older than you in a job interview and you both say 'Hello, sir' and 'Yes, I also think the Dow Jones has been fluctuating dangerously this last few days' and 'Oh, absolutely, the 405 is a nightmare this time of day'. And all along you <em>know</em> you both laugh at poop jokes and fart sounds and you have all these hobbies and interests and you curse and say fuck and shit and asshole. You're real people. But you act like robots. You have to put on the face, and they have to put on a face, and you have to pretend that nothing in life is ever fun, everything is productivity and seriousness."</p>
<p>"Is that what makes it hard?" I asked. "That everyone's just… faking their way through adulthood?"</p>
<p>"No. No, that's expected. It sucks, but we all know what we're getting into." He sighed. "No, what catches you by 
surprise are the little things about growing up. It's being stuck in traffic and remembering a day. Any day. A locker 
room conversation in high school. A teacher. A friend of a friend. Something that happened long enough ago that 
it could order its own drink. It sneaks up on you, and you look at yourself in the rear view and you think, my 
God… where did it go? When did I become so old?</p>
<p>"I remember college like it was yesterday. I remember my girlfriends and my friends and they used to drink and 
talk about sex and hanging out and now they all eat oatmeal and go to funerals. And I do that to, and I <em>like</em> all of that. Well, not going to funerals, but oatmeal. Soap operas. Going to bed at nine. I like it."</p>
<p>"So what's the problem?"</p>
<p>"The problem is I'm still the sixteen year old. I'm still the college kid. My needs and wants have changed, and my 
body has changed, and my mind has changed, in a way, but <em>I</em> didn't change. I'm still putting on a face. So when 
these thoughts sneak up on me – when a flash of a college party or a roadtrip or the feeling of falling asleep in the 
back of my Dad's car wells up on me… it breaks me. It breaks me because I don't think of it fondly. I don't look at 
that young kid with affection and nostalgia, I look at him with envy. Envy, because he's got all of that ahead of him 
still, and he doesn't even know how lucky he is. He's me, we're the same – but he's got the good looks and the 
health and all the years ahead of him, and I'm wasting away in an old apartment. And I hate that kid so much. Every time he sneaks up on me I hate him more."</p>
<p>I looked down, then up. "What about family? Kids?"</p>
<p>"They are great. They are amazing. But they go away. They're not <em>you</em>. In the end, you raise your sons and 
daughters for the world, not for yourself. They have to fall asleep in the back of <em>my</em> car, and go to <em>their</em> college parties and all that… they don't exist for my benefit. No one exists for my benefit but myself. And I'm much too old to do anything about it."</p>
<p>I swallowed dry and averted my eyes to the fireplace. The old man leaned forward. "We always get the feeling that 
the good old days are either behind us or ahead of us. They're never our own days. We were always born just a 
bit too late to go to Woodstock or to see Nirvana live or to see the Berlin Wall fall or to party Great Gatsby style in the 20's. And then we get old and we realize we were born too soon to see the wonders of technology and the world reshaping and blooming into something new and exciting. But the truth is, our Woodstocks were happening all around us as we grew. Our new and exciting world was some old guy's boring present, and our past will be some spoiled, arrogant kid's 'Good old days'. We were just too stupid to realize it when it mattered. So we let it slide away. And then we ended up like me – sad and resentful of our younger selves for all they can still do and we can't."</p>
<p>Finally, I got up. I went to the old man and I knelt in front of him. "I'm sorry I brought you over."</p>
<p>"It's okay," he said. "I knew you would. After all, I did it, sixty years ago."</p>
<p>I looked at my own eyes. Despite the wrinkles around them, they still looked pretty much the same. The old man 
shook his head and sniffed a tear away. "Now let's go back to your lab so you can send me back to my own time, 
so I can hate you in peace."</p>
<p>I hugged my own eighty year old version and leaned away and nodded. "I'll enjoy it," I said. "And I'll know I'm living in the good old days, I promise."</p>
<p>He got up with difficulty. "No, you won't," he said. "The good old days are only ever good when they're gone. That's what makes them good. When you're living through them, they're just... days."</p>
<p>He slow-stepped ahead of me towards the lab. Then he spoke without turning his head: "And days go by really fast, man. They go by really fast."</p>

<h4>[WP] You obtain a device that tells you exactly what choices to make in order to lead the "happiest" life possible. Some of these choices get hard to make.</h4>
<p>Score: 4928</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now say that you won't just kill <strong>them</strong>. You'll also kill <strong>their families</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stared at the words on the terminal in disbelief. My hands hovered over the keyboard. I wanted to reply, but... holy shit. How do you respond to an order like that??</p>
<p>"I can't do that!" I typed back. The keys clacked as I wrote it; the keyboard was very old. The computer and all the hardware was an old Tandy Color Computer back from 1981. You'd think I would have upgraded by now, but my Oracle preferred to stay in here. And who am I to question its orders? In nearly forty years, it really hadn't ever steered me wrong. So we stayed with this one. Everyone thought I was weird for keeping it in my office, but I just explained it away as nostalgia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You won't <strong>actually</strong> have to kill their families. You just have to threaten them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Oh, well that's so much better</em>, I thought. <em>Just threaten to murder innocent women and children. No big deal</em>.</p>
<p>"You know what," I wrote back, practically pounding on the ancient beige keyboard, "That's it. That's it, Oracle. I'm done with this whole thing. I quit." My hands shook as I wrote it, and my heart was hammering against my ribs. I'd wanted to do it for so long, but I just never could work up the courage to let go. </p>
<p>Oracle had guided me through life since I first got the computer in the 80s. Some kid at Radio Shack told me it would give me good life advice and sold it to me on a floppy disk for two dollars, and I've never been one to pass up a good deal. I figured that at worst, it was just some piece of junk that wouldn't really do anything. This was before viruses and malware were really a thing. So I popped in the disk, and it told me that I should start brushing my teeth twice a day instead of just once. </p>
<p>Every day, it was a new piece of advice. Just little things to begin with, like changing up my hairstyle or whatever, but it eventually gained my trust and started meddling more and more with my life. It gave me business advice, stock tips, real estate intelligence, and relationship advice that was always sound. Years later, I've got more money than I ever thought I could make, and I've got a beautiful family. A gorgeous wife, five wonderful children, a great job that I really enjoy... I've got everything. Fame and fortune, with none of the drug problems and mental breakdowns that usually seem to go along with those two. And yet the Oracle kept pushing. It told me that my life could always get better. That it knew exactly what to do. And so I listened. I followed along blindly, and it's led down a dark path to this. </p>
<p>Oracle has made me do terrible things. I've destroyed people's careers, I've humiliated people, said horrible, nasty things that I really didn't mean... but this? Threatening to <em>kill</em> someone's family? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you leave now, it will all be wasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words flashed on Oracle's screen in dull green. There should be a name for that greenish color from before computer monitors could actually display real colors. I'd call it "80's green."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything that you've built will crumble. You know that I am right. And you can make the <strong>world</strong> a better place if you just follow my orders. I've never let you down before. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should have just left right then and there. I could have stood up from the chair and walked out of the room and never looked at Oracle again. Just spent the rest of my life lounging on a sunny beach in Florida or something. But I didn't. I hesitated.</p>
<p>That night, I got up on stage and took the mic in front of thousands of cheering fans. "And we're not just going to hunt down those terrorist bastards in ISIS," I shouted. "We're gonna go after their families, too!" My stomach churned just uttering the words: I was suggesting a <em>war crime</em> like it was a good thing! But of course, the crowds ate it up. Hell, they'd applaud for anything I did nowadays. I could probably shoot someone on 5th avenue and they'd cheer. Once the thunderous wave of clapping died down, I spoke into the mic again. "Thank you, Iowa! Let's make America great again!"</p>

<h4>[wp] after dying god informs you that hell is a myth, and "everyone sins, its ok". instead the dead are sorted into six "houses of heaven" based on the sins they chose.</h4>
<p>Score: 4918</p>
<p>We arrived first at the House of Lust. "House" is a misleading term. It was more of a camp, spread over acres and acres of lush forest. There was a white sandy beach (nude, of course) full of copulating couples. There were little cabins sprinkled all along the path, from which orgasmic moans regularly came belting out. Men with six pack abs and women with perky breasts strolled by without even noticing me and God. They only had eyes for each other, tickling and pinching each other with flirtatious giggles. </p>
<p>"What do you think?" God asked as we passed a nineteen-way taking place in a pool of champagne. Little cherubs flitted overhead armed with mops and cleaning supplies, thankfully. "Lust is our most popular sin." I eyed the supermodel-like figures of a couple passing nearby, and could easily see why. "You can look however you want. Hell, you can be whatever gender you want. No fetish is too taboo, and no desire can be denied here."</p>
<p>It was <em>quite</em> tempting, but I wasn't ready to make a permanent decision here. "Let's see the others," I told God.</p>
<p>We carried on to Greed. We passed rows and rows of mansions, each more opulent than the next. Some of them were so large that they would have had enough bed rooms to fit my entire hometown. And so many different styles: one second, we were in a beautiful French vineyard in front of a gorgeous chateau with the Alps in the background. The next second, a warm tropical beach with a modern mansion atop breathtaking cliffs. After that, a ski chalet in Colorado with a roaring fire in a hearth large enough to fit an ox. Each one had various Italian sports cars and Rolls Royces parked in front, with the occasional smattering of boats, helicopters, etc. </p>
<p>"Any material desire you ever wanted," God explained. "Your own world, where you can have everything. You want the Hope Diamond? You can fly to Washington DC in your own solid gold helicopter and buy it from the Smithsonian. Hell, you can just <em>buy</em> the Smithsonian."</p>
<p>Also tempting, but I decided to keep looking. </p>
<p>Gluttony was next up. Tables and tables of the very finest foods: beautiful steaks cooked medium rare; butter-poached lobster tail; fresh oysters on a half shell; exotic wines in dusty bottles that had been hiding in the cellars of the world's finest restaurants. Everyone had a glass of champagne in hand and simply lounged on couches and chairs near the tables, eating endlessly. As soon as the inhabitants took a bite, the food just instantly came back. My mouth watered even <em>watching</em> them.</p>
<p>"In every other House, the food is practically <em>sawdust</em> compared to Gluttony," God explained. "You haven't truly experienced heaven until you've been to Gluttony."</p>
<p>I shook my head, and we kept moving. </p>
<p>Sloth was as you'd expect. An endless sea of the softest mattresses, stacked with cushions and pillows that made the story of the princess and the pea seem minimalist. Little angels visited each resident, giving them massages that made them all melt into their blankets. </p>
<p>Wrath was... well, a lot like what I'd expect Hell to be like. Fire, brimstone, whips, torture.. you know, the works. Except here, you weren't the one being tortured. Every enemy you'd ever made in your real life was now under your thumb. "Lots of people choose their fathers," God explained. "Lots of grudges against parents in general, you know. But you're not limited to that. Someone beat you out for a big promotion back on Earth? Take your pound of flesh here."</p>
<p>Then we arrived at Envy. It looked... well, a lot like home. </p>
<p>"Go on in," God said, gesturing toward the door. I turned the knob and walked in... and found Emily waiting inside. She ran forward, wrapped her arms around my neck, and planted a kiss right on my lips. "Welcome home, honey."</p>
<p>I looked back toward God. "Oh, don't be coy," he said. "You have no secrets from me. We all know that you were in love with your best friend's wife." She didn't seem to hear him at all; she went back into the hall. "We all know that you just <em>settled</em> for your own wife while secretly pining after her. Well, this is your chance to live happily ever after."</p>
<p>I peered into the kitchen. Emily was baking something, wearing nothing but an apron. Her curly black hair fell softly over her shoulder as she whisked ingredients. She turned back, noticed I was observing her, and an enthusiastic smile spread across her face. </p>
<p>"It's what you've always wanted, isn't it?" God whispered in my ear. </p>
<p>I wanted to take it. God <em>damn</em> did I want to take it. But I shook my head.</p>
<p>God seemed puzzled. "You need to make a decision," he told me. </p>
<p>"I haven't seen Pride yet."</p>
<p>He scoffed. "No one ever wants Pride, trust me."</p>
<p>"Well, I want to see it."</p>
<hr />
<p>Pride was boring. Just a row of workbenches in a bare white room.</p>
<p>"I don't get it," I told God.</p>
<p>"Yeah, no one does," he answered. "That's why no one ever chooses it. Doesn't cavorting in Lust sound better than sitting here building little trinkets for the rest of eternity? Wouldn't you rather gorge yourself in Gluttony? Or spend time with Emily in Envy?"</p>
<p>I considered the options again. "I pick Pride," I finally told him. </p>
<p>He narrowed his eyes. "<em>What?</em> Look at it!" He gestured around the room again. There wasn't much to look at. "Why would you choose <em>this</em> for the rest of time?"</p>
<p>"Because you <em>don't</em> want me to pick it," I told him. If he was really God, he'd know what a contrarian I can be. And I knew he was hiding something, trying to pretend like Pride didn't exist. There was something special about it.</p>
<p>God scowled back. "Fine." He led me over to one of the workbenches. In the center, there was a black space. A blank, empty void that went on forever. "Here's your universe," he said. "You've got seven days to get started." He took his seat at the bench next to me and went back to tinkering in his own world. After a long pause, he finally spoke again: "You know, it might be nice for me to actually have some company for once."</p>

<h4>[WP]: A 92-year-old woman's phone number is one digit away from that of a local suicide hotline. She could have it changed, but she doesn't mind.</h4>
<p>Score: 4799</p>
<p>She reached out for the ringing phone.  For a moment, her stiff fingers fumbled over the buttons, and she cursed the arthritis that stiffened her joints.  She managed to hit the green button, and lifted the handset up to her ear.</p>
<p>"Hello?"</p>
<p>"Hello - I, uh, I just needed to talk to someone.  I don't think I can keep going any longer."</p>
<p>Another one of them.  No matter how many calls she took, there always seemed to be more of them, each with their little problems, so convinced that no one else in the world had ever experienced what they were now going through.  Her eyes drifted over to the two piles of stationary on her windowsill.</p>
<p>"Well, you can talk to me, although you best make it quick - I'm 92, so who knows how much time I've got left."  She settled back into her chair, trying to find a more comfortable position for the phone against her ear.</p>
<p>"92?  Um, is... is this the suicide hotline?"  </p>
<p>Ah, one of the faster ones.  He'd caught on more quickly than some of the callers.  "Afraid not, dear," she replied.  "You're off by a number."</p>
<p>"Oh.  Er, shit."</p>
<p>"Happens more often than you'd think."  She looked around her little bedroom, at the cards on her windowsill, the little bed, the faded pictures.  "But you've got me up, now, so you might as well talk to me.  Otherwise, you'll have roused an old woman from her nap for nothing, and you won't want to die with that hanging over you, would you?"</p>
<p>"Um, no, of course not!  I'm so sorry, miss-"</p>
<p>"Cleo."  She tried propping one arm up on the side of the chair.</p>
<p>"Your name is Miss Cleo?" </p>
<p>"Are you sassing me, young man?" she snapped, her frail voice suddenly surprisingly sharp.</p>
<p>"No, no, of course not.  Um, sorry, Mi- sorry, Cleo.  But I haven't been able to find work for three months, and I'm about to be homeless, and I guess that I was just thinking about ending-"</p>
<p>"You know, you sound a little like my husband," she said dreamily.  "He always had such a soft voice, sounded so vulnerable.  When he met me in person for the first time, I couldn't believe that it was the same man.  But he was going through troubles, too."</p>
<p>"Oh.  What troubles?"  </p>
<p>"The usual - he'd fallen hard for me, but he didn't have a job or a dollar to his name, and he was certain that I wouldn't look twice at him."  She smiled a little to herself.  "He was an idiot, of course.  Didn't ever give himself credit."</p>
<p>"How did he turn things around?  Um, if you don't mind me asking, of course."</p>
<p>"Oh, young man, I'm just happy to be talking to someone.  He nearly didn't turn things around, but I snapped at him, told him that he was a little shit if he expected things to fall into his lap without effort.  Oh, you should have seen his face - I don't think anyone had ever raised their voice to him, much less a dainty little gal like me!"  She laughed, and the voice on the phone laughed with her.</p>
<p>"And he turned things around, then?  Made something of himself?"</p>
<p>"It took some time," she reflected.  With a grunt, she pulled herself up out of her chair, walking over to the windowsill of her little room.  "He went through plenty of failures.  But he loved me, and he hated coming home to a tongue lashing from me, so he kept on trying!"</p>
<p>"Wow."  A pause.  "I don't have anyone in my life like that, I guess."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't have my husband any longer, so that makes us even," she snapped at him.  The windowsill was littered with cards.  On one side, the cards stood propped up, a display of bright colors, all clashing against each other.  On the other side, the cards were plain white, sorted into a neat stack.  "But it wasn't just me - it was the way he looked at things after I set him straight."</p>
<p>"What was that, then?"</p>
<p>She picked up one of the bright cards, smiling as she read the kind words hand-written inside.  "He thought that he should quit before things got worse.  But I pointed out to him that it's not whether we fall or rise, but where we're at when we check out.  I pointed at him, and said, 'do you want to walk up to them pearly gates and admit that you didn't make every attempt you could to better yourself?'"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I don't know what else I can-"</p>
<p>"Oh, you sound so like him," she interrupted, setting the bright card down.  She liked re-reading those bright cards.  "Always hoping for the lazy way out."</p>
<p>"I'm not lazy, Cleo-"</p>
<p>"Of course not, but only a lazy man refuses to see a job through to its very end," she countered him.  "And years later, my husband returned home every night, happy with his hard work, showing me a lesson by telling me of how he'd fought for every success."  She ran her finger over another bright card.  "He never caught on that this was my plan all along, that lovable man."</p>
<p>"If..."</p>
<p>She waited.  Her eyes drifted to the plain white cards, but she didn't want to jinx anything.</p>
<p>"If I managed to succeed at something, could I come tell you about it?"</p>
<p>There it was.  She smiled, happily taking her eyes off of the plain white cards.  "Well, of course you could, dear.  You sound like a very nice young man.  I'll give you my nursing home address, but you'd best work hard - I don't know how much longer I have."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you'll be around for plenty longer, Cleo, with that sharp mind."</p>
<p>"Flattery will get you nowhere, young man," she replied, but smiled as she said it.  "Now, what's your name?"</p>
<p>"Uh, it's John."</p>
<p>"Well, I expect a card from you, John," she told him.  "Something nice, with a real comment from you written inside.  Nothing silly or inappropriate, mind you."</p>
<p>"You got it, Cleo.  I'll send you one.  I promise."</p>
<p>"Then I'll let you go, John.  Have a good rest of your day now, you hear?"  She smiled, glaring triumphantly at the pile of white cards.  Not today, she thought.</p>
<p>"You too, Cleo.  And thank you."</p>
<p>She lowered the phone, carefully putting it back in the cradle to charge.  Hopefully, another bright card would come soon.  John sounded like a nice man, she thought to herself.  He could get better.</p>
<p>And with his card, she'd have forty-eight bright cards, to the twenty-four white cards.  Double.</p>
<p>She didn't know if it would be enough, if it would ever be enough.  She picked up one of those white cards, her fingers trembling slightly as she traced the ornate script.  </p>
<p>"We are saddened to invite you to the funeral of..." she read, before she had to put the card down.</p>
<p>Twenty-four failures.  Each one weighed at her, dragging her down.  Twenty-four callers for whom she'd been too late.</p>
<p>But John sounded promising.  She looked forward to his card.</p>

<h4>[WP] Michael, a 15 year old Call of Duty player, realizes the greatest trash-talking opportunity of all time. Over his headset, he recognizes his opponent's voice as that of President Obama.</h4>
<p>Score: 4324</p>
<p>You'd think that the Secret Service would have some clue about combat tactics, but apparently not. They were all bunched up around the President as bullet shields, and weren't even moving while Obama did his best to line up a sniper shot. One grenade was all it took, giving me an amazing killstreak and finally earning me a gunship. </p>
<p>"Very good move, XxXBlahzeItFahGetXxX," a voice came over the mic. He pronounced "Blahze" as "blasé" and "Fahget" like a Bostonian trying to say "Forget." But I hardly even noticed that at the time because I realized <em>it was Barack FUCKING Obama!</em> "You really got me there."</p>
<p>I was too excited to even contain myself. Holy crap, what an opportunity! I could <em>make history</em> here; this was my modern-day Boston Tea Party! I was wracked with indecision: what slur do I start with? Racial would be the obvious choice, but he's probably desensitized to it by now. Maybe some good "pillowbiters" and the classic standby "faggot." But those are all just so... played out. I needed something brand new. Something that would <em>wow</em> everyone when the audio was eventually released. Speaking of which, I ordered the in-game recording to start. </p>
<p>Finally, I had it. The perfect insult. "Hey, Obama!" I said into the mic. "Get ready to get rekt, you fucking queer..."</p>
<p>"Shut your pre-pubescent little fuckwad mouth!" he shouted back. "I'm going to fuck your mom so hard tonight that you'll <em>retroactively</em> become black! She won't be able to sit down for <em>weeks</em>. You think I'm kidding, you little bitch? I'm the most powerful man on the planet!" What followed was the most horrendous tirade of slurs and insults that I'd ever heard in my entire life. I couldn't have interrupted even if I wanted to. It was like the man didn't even stop to take a breath for Christ's sake. He was still shouting at me even after the game ended, and I could just barely hear the secret service agents laughing in the background.</p>
<p>I quit the game, and my phone rang almost immediately showing my best friend's number on the caller ID. He was never going to believe what had happened.</p>
<p>"Hey Ja..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, you thought it was your gay lover Jason, didn't you, faggot? Well it's not, bitch! I've got the NSA on my side, what have you... <em>click</em>" I hung up on the President. He tried calling back as Jason again. Then as my grandmother. Then as the girl I had a crush on. I silenced the phone and threw it behind my bed and ran downstairs.</p>
<p>Mom was in the living room on her iPad. As soon as I entered, she jumped up and gave me a hug. "You're never going to believe it," she said. "We just received <em>an invitation to visit the White House</em> next week!" She showed me the email with the official .gov address and everything. "We're going to get to meet with President Obama!" she told me. "And it even says that he wants to 'have a one-on-one session' with me <em>personally</em>!"</p>
<p>I backed away slowly in horror, then ran up the stairs and bolted into my room. I fished my phone out from behind my bed and checked: 17 missed calls, and one text message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, you thought I was just shit-talking, didn't you? See you soon, bitch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>[WP] One night as you play Call of Duty a particularly squeaky voiced 12 year old gives out personal information leading you to discover he is your child from a long lost lover. You must now convince him you are his father and thus banged his mom, through Xbox live.</h4>
<p>Score: 4194</p>
<p>"Listen, Andrew," She'd sent me a letter with his name and a bunch of information about him, but I never thought it would lead to anything. Never thought I'd even remember the name of his school, and his best friend. And of all places, Xbox live? Who would have thought that I'd coincidentally find my own son, and that my first impression of him would be his username: 6969BongHitterX. And to add insult to injury, he was camping near a respawn point. I'd failed as a father.</p>
<p>"Faggot, I pwned you so hard! Listen to you cry!"</p>
<p>"I'm serious! Your mom... is her name Sarah? Is she blond, a nurse at the hospital? And her father owns Mike's Bistro in town?"</p>
<p>"Boom, headshot!" He wasn't listening to me; he'd gone back to running around the map looking for a new weapon. Had he muted me? Had I already lost my chance? </p>
<p>"Andrew, you need to listen." My character was following him around the map trying to get his attention. "Your mother..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I fucked your mother! I did it in your own basement, you neckbeard faggot!"</p>
<p>"I'm serious!" I shouted back to him as he shot my character yet again. I grumbled angrily, waiting to respawn and searching the map for him once more. "You need to listen to me! You live on Elm Avenue, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Who is this?" he squeaked into the microphone. I could hear the puberty in his voice. "Sam, is this you, you faggot? I'm going to kick your ass at school tomorrow, you little bitch!"</p>
<p>"Andrew, your mom has a tattoo of a rose on the back of her neck, doesn't she?"</p>
<p>His avatar stopped moving, and his microphone fell silent. Our characters stood looking at each other awkwardly until we were both splattered by another group driving a Warthog. Without another word, Andrew left the game. I sighed and signed out too. I guess it wasn't meant to be.</p>
<hr />
<p>"who is this?" the message said. </p>
<p>It had been days, but he hadn't even answered my friend request. Every night I debated whether I should just contact his mother again. Just talking to him, even through the game, made the whole thing so... <em>real</em>. Before that, he was just some kid that was out there somewhere. An abstract idea that I was sure was doing just fine without me. Sarah had made it clear that they didn't need me in their lives, and I was fine with that back then. I was more into drugs anyway. A lot had changed in twelve years.</p>
<p>"I know this is going to be weird... but I'm your father. I used to live in Perryville too, years and years ago. Your mom and I were both counselors at the same summer camp, and we just had one of those romances. But at the end of the summer, we just went our separate ways. I went off to college and she stuck around. And she didn't tell me I had a kid until a few years later. She sent me occasional letters and pictures of you, but I just.... I never thought about it too much until now. Would you maybe like to meet and talk about it sometime?"</p>
<p>My hands shook as I typed the question. Was I really ready for this? But it wasn't up to me at this point. The ball was in my son's court. </p>
<p>A week later, he answered: "ok."</p>
<hr />
<p>I waited nervously at the coffee shop. I'd driven eleven hours to meet Andrew, and I was a jittery mess, I'm sure. But that didn't matter. I could barely contain my excitement at being reunited. I briefly wondered whether Sarah would be with him. He hadn't mentioned telling her, but hopefully he was smart enough to not meet strangers off of the internet without even telling his mom. </p>
<p>The bell chimed, and I looked up immediately, as I had done the last dozen times someone entered the store. And this time, it was him. He wore faded jeans and an old t-shirt that might have actually been one of mine. Had his mother really saved it for all these years? </p>
<p>I stood up tentatively from behind the table. My legs didn't seem to be working very well, and I had to lean on the back of my chair for support. Our eyes met, and I instantly knew it was my son. The exact same shape and hazel shade that stared back at me through the mirror every morning. My lips quivered into a nervous smile. It was really happening. I was finally going to meet him. </p>
<p>"Andrew?" I asked. He nodded; there was just a hint of tears welling up in the corner of his eyes. </p>
<p>I didn't know what to do. Do we... shake hands? Hug? We approached each other awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Dad?" It was definitely the same voice I'd heard through the Xbox microphone.</p>
<p>I punched him straight in the face, so hard that it sent him reeling back against the door. A collective gasp rose from the horrified barista and the shocked patrons of the coffeeshop.</p>
<p>"Headshot, you little bastard! No scope!"</p>
<p>He slumped to the floor, clutching at his bleeding nose. And as I crowed with victory, I teabagged the little faggot.</p>

<h4>[WP] A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rouge planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".</h4>
<p>Score: 3891</p>
<p>The house was filled with tears of sadness, joy and laughter. Long hugs, intense and heartfelt kisses, jokes to cheer up the inevitability of a saddened mood. Chris sat on the couch, surrounded by his friends and his family, and he couldn't but smile. The melancholy of the situation weighed on him, and yet there was this feeling that he couldn't shake off. ''If we have to go, then this is a pretty decent way of going.''</p>
<p>The crash of the two planets had been predicted to happen at 5:55AM EST, 25th October 2015. The planet had come in NASA's sights roughly a month ago, and from that moment on everything changed.</p>
<p>There was of course an uproar. People panicked, immediately thinking the world was about to end. It was 2012 all over again, with mass conspirators claiming they had seen it coming and that the USA, the UN or the lizard people were the cause of it. The closer we got to 31th since that moment, the more the average people started to dread. The governments kept people updated, but after a while the impending doom was wide-spread. ''If they would've been able to do something about, they would've, by now'' was the train of thought most people had. And when the rocket launches NASA did failed and didn't alter the planet's course for five times, people lost hope.</p>
<p>Since that moment some people died, thinking it was better to take fate into own hands. Others got careless with drugs and died by overdose. The others just kept going. Irrelevant jobs were abandoned, but luckily a large amount of people volunteered to keep doing the important jobs like rail roads and food supply for that last month.</p>
<p>All the people who were still with us on this 24th day of October had accepted whatever was coming from them. Chris had too. What other choice did he have? It was not like he could do anything about it. He didn't have the knowledge, nor the time.</p>
<p>Chris drifted off, knowing he would be woken if anything important was to happen. He woke up, hours later, in a dead silent room. His heart jumped, his sight still foggy from his deep slumber. Did he miss it? Was it over already? Of course not. Why would I be alive then? Wait? What if we survived? He rubbed in his eyes to regain vision. He looked around.</p>
<p>Nothing moved. Absolutely nothing happened.</p>
<p>''Hello? People?''</p>
<p>No reaction. Not a sound, not a movement, not a blink of an eye. </p>
<p>And then a sharp pain in his forearm. He looked down and saw a smear of blood. ''What the hell?'' Chris shouted while he shot up from the couch. Holding his breath he walked to the sink confused and cleared up the blood with a splash of water. As he dried it with a paper towel, he could read an etching engraved into his arm. It already had the faded pink color of a scar gotten long ago, and it read:</p>
<p>''No matter how long it takes, save us.''</p>
<p>Chris exhaled.</p>

<h4>[WP] An elderly couple takes to petty crime to see their superhero kids who no longer call.</h4>
<p>Score: 3699</p>
<p>James was the average man of his age; he grew up in a poor family with five siblings, got conscripted into Vietnam where he made friends and lost some too, then came home to a family of his own. Unlike his parents, though, he decided to have just one child- he saw both how much his parents struggled and how little affection they showed with such massive time constraints. Supporting that many children is no simple task, and comes with sacrifice. The six of them returned the favor later in life, visiting and helping take care of their parents until old age took them from this world.</p>
<p>Now, James is seventy-two; wisps of grey hairs poke out of his head like fading memories. His life is dull, his back and hips are worn out to the point he can't garden for long or fire a rifle properly anymore. Old age takes a lot of what you once loved from you, including the people around you. Three siblings lost, and a wife that passed too soon...</p>
<p>But his son is enough to make it all worth it. The light of his life; the sum of his existence. The culmination of years spent nurturing, like a sapling sprouting into a thick, strong Oak tree.</p>
<hr />
<p>James lazily flipped through channels on the TV, earning grumpy shouts of refute from the other elderly people sitting in the rec room with him. </p>
<p>"Keep the damn channel still, you're going to give me vertigo."</p>
<p>He shushed her. "Quiet, Doris. My son might be on TV again and I need to find him."</p>
<p>Channel 5 was the jackpot.</p>
<p>"<em>Breaking news, brought to you live: during an armed heist of the local Bank of America, one man took down five burglars single-handed. It's unlike anything we've ever seen before- no hostages were harmed, and the money has been returned safely. We'll keep you updated as time goes by.</em>"</p>
<p>The helicopter camera panned out over a crowd of bystanders cheering and police taking the robbers into custody. Just barely, as James scooted forward and squinted, he could see his son waving to the crowd.</p>
<p>"See, Doris! That's my Kevin! I told you he'd be on TV again!" The old man lit up like a Christmas tree on a dark, December night.</p>
<p>"That's not even impressive. Frank, I want to watch the cooking shows. Change it back already."</p>
<p>His smile faded, twisting into a frown. "What the fuck am I doing in this place? I'm not Frank. Here, Doris, watch your cooking shows."</p>
<p>He changed the channel, went back to his room and put proper clothes on. <em>How long has it been? A year, maybe more? Two years? I can't wait any longer. I need to see my baby boy again.</em></p>
<p>Rifling through his closet, there was a carton of old love letters from his late wife. He looked at them and smiled, but underneath them was a .22 pistol that no one had caught during his entry inspection. He slipped it under his belt and walked up to the front desk. "Melissa, I'm gonna go for a walk today."</p>
<p>She looked up from her cell phone and lazily waved a hand at him, buzzing the door open. He pretended to follow his usual path, hobbling on his cane, then deviated and slipped through an opening in the brush out back. He made his way to a gas station. </p>
<p>"Give me your money. Just a few dollars is fine," James shouted weakly, gun trembling in the air.</p>
<p>The cashier was calm for the situation. "Sir, put the gun down. Let me help you, okay? What do you need?"</p>
<p>James' voice began to crack. "Please, give me some money and call the police."</p>
<p>"Sir, j-"</p>
<p>"DO IT," he screamed, firing a shot to the right of him. Glass rained down with bits of cardboard and broken cigarettes. The man lifted his arms up and obliged, then handed him a hundred dollar bill.</p>
<p>James sat down outside the building and waited for about five minutes, staring at the clouds go by. Soon enough, his son arrived, like he always did.</p>
<p>"My son! I knew the city's superhero would make it here to save the day."</p>
<p>Kevin groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Dad, I'm not a superhero. I always tell you, I'm just a cop who does his job well. Come on, why'd you go and do something this drastic? Where'd you get the gun? Someone could've really been hurt, Dad."</p>
<p>James looked down, answering meekly. "I wanted to see you again. It's been several years now, you're always so busy."</p>
<p>Kevin took a deep breath as his father began to cry. "Come on, let's take you back to Glowing Meadows."</p>
<p>James lit up again, the hope of a younger man glinting in his eyes. "Can we play checkers?"</p>
<p>Kevin put an arm around his father, helping him into the car. "Yeah, we can play checkers. Just get in the car while I explain this to my supervisor, okay?"</p>
<p>"Sure thing, Kev, my man. I can't wait for you to tell me all about your job, and your love life. You need to get married and give me grandchildren!"</p>

<p>I was back in my seat, around six hours before the accident, watching the in-flight entertainment, and wondering how something like a plane crash could become so boring so quickly.</p>
<p>The plane loses an engine, all the warning lights start to go off, the plane tilts down, a smell of smoke, and I'm back here. Every time.</p>
<p>This is at least the ninth time I've looped, and after going through most of the good in-flight movies, I was down to the slim pickings when I had an idea.</p>
<p>I go back whenever I'm about to die...right?</p>

<p>I can predict the future. A real life psychic. I can mold my life to be the best one possible. Killing people just to see what happens, then going back and doing it again. Stock markets, speculation, investments, unexplored possibilities revisited, old loves rekindled-</p>

<h4>[WP] Imaginary friends usually move on to a new child when their child stops believing in them. This imaginary friend, however, decides to stay behind because he has a feeling things are about to go very, very wrong for his child.</h4>
<p>Score: 3550</p>
<p>"Will we always be friends?" Sarah asked the darkness of her bedroom.</p>
<p>"Of course," Danny the Dino Man replied, "we will always be the best of friends."</p>
<p>"No matter what?"</p>
<p>"No matter what."</p>
<p>Sarah's mother, a world-renowned microbiologist had spent hours, only that very morning, discussing with Sarah why imaginary friends were not real. You see, imaginary friends were not rooted in science. At least, not the kind of science adults could see. </p>
<p>And on any other day, Danny the Dino Man would have moved on. That was the tradition, after all. When a child was old enough to understand the reasoning behind a parent's insistence that imaginary friends were not real, it was the duty of that imaginary friend to report back to the agency of Imaginary Matches for reassignment. </p>
<p>But Sarah was no ordinary child. And Danny the Dino Man was one of the best imaginary friends in the business. He was a seasoned veteran, and never once had he met a soul so loving as Sarah. She lit up when she played, and all the play revolved around being a doctor and helping anyone who needed some fixing. </p>
<p>Danny patted her head, and stroked her hair behind her ear as she fell asleep. He had always hoped in the best for her. She was going to be a brilliant doctor someday. And he knew it as time for him to go. He had done his duty, been there when her mother had not, and provided the inspiration her file had required. He had been the companion her young and growing soul needed. </p>
<p>But somehow, he could not manage to leave her. She was soundly asleep, and he sat down on the floor, ready to crawl his way under the bed back to his home land, but something held him there. </p>
<p>The door of her bedroom creaked open behind him. That would be Mom, coming home from the late shift, he knew. Only... the shadow was all wrong as the light fell across the floor from the hall. Danny turned, and there was a man. An adult man.</p>
<p>Imaginary friends were entirely invisible to adults. This man made him shiver. He looked normal, respectable even, in a button-up shirt and loosened tie. Perhaps he was a doctor friend of Sarah's mom. Danny's stomach clenched in knots. </p>
<p>The man walked to the bed, sat down on the edge, and stroked Sarah's hair. No, stroking was not the right word. It was not loving and protective, it was...molesting. Sarah woke up, and before she could even scream, the man's hand covered her mouth. He pulled the covers back and climbed on top of her. </p>
<p>Danny was powerless. Imaginary friends could not touch adults. If he could have... he would have shown him how ferocious a T-Rex could really be. But he could not. He could only hold Sarah's hand.</p>
<p>"I am right here with you," he told her, "and that's how it will always be."</p>
<p>Sarah cried, and sobbed, and never said a word. For hours after the man left, she cried onto Danny's scaly chest. For hours, Danny told her it would be alright, only to realize it was not. No part of what had happened was alright. </p>
<p>The next day, Sarah's mom asked her why she was upset. Danny held her hand at the breakfast table. She would not speak.</p>
<p>"Are you upset about Danny leaving?" she would ask, "did you have nightmares?"</p>
<p>But Sarah did not speak. And for years, Sarah was angry at Danny.</p>
<p>Children were funny that way, he knew. Memories were often fuzzy, and blame got shifted. And somehow, Danny became the boogeyman of nightmares. And Sarah's mother introduced her new boyfriend several weeks later. They married when Sarah was six.</p>
<p>But, Danny was a Dino Man of his word. He never returned for reassignment. He became invisible to Sarah as she grew, and he watched as she tore her own flesh open, deeper and deeper every night. He watched as she stared into the mirror with hate, pinching and poking her disgusting flesh with an anger unrivaled by anything Danny had ever seen. </p>
<p>He watched it all. He watched her grow, and he watched her lose interest in school, in achievement, and he watched her numbness outgrow her beauty. Danny watched Sarah fight with her mother. He watched them scream, and throw things, and he watched her mother give up. He watched the step-father every night. </p>
<p>And, in time, he watched Sarah give up on herself. Her step-father had taken so much from her. But worst of all, he had taken her self-esteem. He had trapped her in the belief that she deserved what had happened to her. And she had actively sought to ruin herself to make that belief a truth. </p>
<p>It broke Danny's heart to see the girl he loved, the brilliant doctor-to-be, become a surgeon of her own flesh. There are no kind of words for that aching agony. Where once, Danny would have slept next to her bed, and told her great stories of Dino battles, he watched her sob herself into the dark abyss of night, only to have the light awaken her and continue the death trap of life she was stuck in.</p>
<p>But eventually Sarah ran away, and Danny followed. Sarah was seventeen when she tried heroin for the first time. It was then that Danny realized the power of mind-altering drugs. Sarah, the adult, could now see Danny. </p>
<p>Surely, he thought, that this would be his moment. But, in reality, he had never felt so terrible in his whole life. </p>
<p>"YOU KNEW!" she screamed, terrible in her wrath, "YOU KNEW AND DID NOTHING!"</p>
<p>"I could not do anything." It was all he could manage.</p>
<p>"I HATE YOU!"</p>
<p>She screamed, and swore, and turned away, and ran, and vomited.</p>
<p>And he knew her anger was misplaced. He accepted it. In fact, if it could help her accept that what had happened was a terrible trial, he would be the face of her anger. He would do anything to help his favorite child, even if she was an adult now.</p>
<p>Everyday, as Sarah shot up, Danny would appear to her. Day by day, her anger grew less, and their conversations grew longer. A year after she left home, Danny had become a constant in her life once more. Not because she was always using, no, in fact, she had quit entirely. But she could see him because she believed. That belief was something adults lacked on their own. His Sarah, the amazing and imaginative, had not fallen short in adulthood.</p>
<p>They talked and talked, as only old friends could. Eventually, she got a respectable job as a waitress, and even went to school. After some urging from Danny, she even went to the police and sought out counseling.</p>
<p>Danny was a Dino Man of his word. When she sat in the court room, facing her step-father, she recounted the awful things that had happened. She recounted the way she had felt, and the things she had done. The things he had done. The things she had done, the lies she had told to keep his secret, and the way her mind had been manipulated. And Danny the Dino Man held her hand the whole time. </p>
<p>He traced the scars on her arms, and it was the proudest moment of his life. She cried, and she let it out. She had accepted the past. Danny the Dino Man had finally achieved what he had set out to do. Sarah had needed a friend long after childhood, and though the rules were against that, and life seemed to work against him, he achieved it through love. She thanked him, for having kept his promise thirteen years ago. </p>
<p>He returned on occasion to visit Sarah, though eventually she lost her ability to see him again. After nearly another decade and several successful assignments, Danny received one for a little girl named Ivy. </p>
<p>When Danny saw Ivy tell her mother about her imaginary friend, Danny the Dino Man... well, that was the proudest moment of his life, too. Sarah's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>"Danny might be the best friend you ever have. Keep him close, and tell him I love him."</p>

<h4>[WP] You tell Death that you will never tire of living no matter how long you live. It makes you a bet that you will and thus grants you true immortality. You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled.</h4>
<p>Score: 3304</p>
<p>These old eyes of mine have probably seen everything. I've seen species grow from single cells to monstrous, frighteningly smart creatures. I've seen civilizations rise, fall, rise again. Been a part of more than a few myself. I've been witness to every conflict I can imagine, from petty personal passive-aggression to skirmishes between tribes to planetary-scale turf wars all the way up to intergalactic grudges. Conflict never really changes, as far as I can tell. I've seen love, too. Not nearly enough of it, mind.</p>
<p>I've seen black holes form, nebulae birthing stars, solar systems spin from nonexistence into form. Cosmic dreamscapes and heavenly formations playing out in slow motion over billions, trillions of old Earth years. Can't say for sure how long I've watched the lights. I lose track of time as I float on.</p>
<p>"It'll never get old," I said once. "The universe. Massive, unpredictable, shining beauty that she is." Turns out someone, somewhere was listening - and they found it funny. When my time was up, when normally I'd finally be uncoiled from this mortality, I found myself sticking around. No light at the end of the tunnel, just a voice.</p>
<p>"THE UNIVERSE REPEATS. IN ITS INFINITY OF INFINITIES THERE IS NOTHING TRULY NEW. EVERYTHING THAT WAS, IS, WILL BE IS ALREADY OLDER THAN CAN BE EXPRESSED. YOU BELIEVE YOU WILL NEVER TIRE? PROVE THIS TO ME."</p>
<p>It's been a few cycles since then. The universe repeats, they said. That's true. I've seen all that anything can be, every possible configuration of atoms, strings, or whatever things really are deep down. I have literally seen <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>It's a good thing I can't remember any of it.</p>
<p>See, the human mind is an interesting piece of hardware. Thrives on novelty. If you do one single thing enough times, you'll bore eventually. Whoever keeps me around here wagered that that'd hold true. The human mind only has so much storage, though. Only so many memories fit in the lump of meat and electricity. If you fill it up, every time you see something, every time you <em>perceive</em>, you'll lose something. It's like overfilling a bathtub. You add some water, some more splashes out.</p>
<p>Imagine that to infinity. My mind, cycling through the universe's water supply. Forgetting and making new memories. Every time I see completely alien art, every time I float through a cluster of stars, every time I love and lose and love again, I thrill.</p>
<p>It might not be <em>new</em>. But it's new to me.</p>
<hr />
<p>(I'm open to constructive criticism - I'm working to improve)</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: 1 day later. The response has been completely unexpected and overwhelming. I'm not at all sure how to respond, so I hope this will do.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who read this and enjoyed it. I only very recently began writing fiction, and I didn't expect so many people to respond so well to my early efforts. I'm still convinced that this whole thing was a combination of beginner's luck, a compelling prompt (thank you u/Gravitiaxis), and being in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>I'm going to keep writing. Very little of it is going to be this well-received, I think, but I hope someone enjoys what I create in the future.</p>

<hr />
<p>You'd be surprised how easy it was to live in the world where superpowers were the norm. Even though I didn't have super powers, it was easy to get around, they didn't expect everyone to have super strength, or everyone to fly, so I was able to just always be the person who needed help. Nothing too bad. It was pretty annoying, not having a power that was useful, but I'd been dealing with it as long as I'd been alive, so I was surviving.</p>
<p>My power was increased perception, and minor at that. I could notice the pulled thread on anyone's sweater, I could see that someone had been crying the day before based on a slight difference in the colour of their eye. For all intents and purposes, I was just someone who paid attention, meanwhile my friend Todd could throw a car several city blocks, as long as he was with Laura.</p>
<p>Power was tied to your soul mate, which meant that as long as your soul mate was around, you were unbelievably more powerful, which meant that I would probably REALLY notice her. Not that it mattered, people usually didn't meet their soul mates, there were seven billion of us, and you only had one soul mate, chances were that she or he was somewhere in China, flying around or some shit.</p>
<p>So I kept watching the bubbles in my beer float up, I could tell you what speed they were going at, or what the other people were drinking based on the colour of their glass, but it was a party trick, "Toby," Todd cut in, "Earth to Toby."</p>
<p>"Present," I said, glancing up at him, his arm around Laura, showing off the relationship to everyone at the table.</p>
<p>"You excited to meet your soul mate?"</p>
<p>"Ha," I sat myself up so I was at least paying attention to him. He was taking the time and effort to set me up with one of his friends from work, I might as well try to seem interested. It wasn't easy to convince girls to date a guy who couldn't take them on a flight somewhere, "What's she like?"</p>
<p>"Dude, I've been telling you for the past hour,"</p>
<p>"Well I wasn't paying,"</p>
<p>"Yeah you were, you can't, not pay attention," he pointed out the flaw in my argument, "you just wanted to check if I could keep the story straight."</p>
<p>"Guilty."</p>
<p>"Well I'm telling you, she's hot and she sucks like you."</p>
<p>"Cool." I caught the glare from Laura on the hot comment, she was the kind of girl who checked your phone at night, "What time is she getting here?"</p>
<p>"Why don't you tell me, cowboy?" He said and then the door opened across the bar, I flicked my eyes over to look at who was walking in and caught her. To call her a smoke show would be a disservice to how hot she was. She was the kind of girl who got rejected from model shoots for making the rest of the girls look bad. If that was the girl that Todd had gotten for me, I needed to buy him tickets to the fucking Bahamas.</p>
<p>"Is that her at the door Todd?" There wasn't a response, "Earth to Todd?" Still no response, I looked over to him, blank-faced with a dumb smile, but not moving at all. I flicked my eyes over to the girl at the door, she was still walking in. I stood up to get to her.</p>
<p>"Hi," I said, holding out my hand to her, "I think you're stopping time or something by accident."</p>
<p>"I can't do that," she said with a smile, "pretty sure that's you."</p>
<p>"You know Todd?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Well I'm Toby, and trust me, I can't do that either."</p>

<p>June went first - that was just her way. </p>
<p>We both knew it was coming - well into our 90th year of life, having been together for 60, we may as well have been a single organism. Not a single person, alive or dead, knew either one of us better than we knew each other. </p>
<p>"I'll be the first to go," she'd said suddenly. I had laughed and told her not to be silly, that I had to go first so she could be sure I actually did it. </p>
<p>She'd simply smiled sadly, and patted my hand in a comforting way. </p>
<p>"I'm serious, Jeb. I can feel it."</p>
<p>And she'd been right, as she always had. </p>
<p>I had watched her slip away, watched her breathing grow shallower until her chest barely rose, then simply didn't rise again. </p>
<p>My heart broke, and in that moment, I knew I wouldn't be far behind her. I stayed just long enough to make sure she passed comfortably.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, June," I'd thought to myself as I increased the morphine drip in my arm well past the overdose mark, "I'm right behind you." </p>
<p>It's always been a cliché, but as I slipped from this life and departed for the next, I found myself in a bright tunnel. Light rushed towards me, and I could hear her calling to me, beckoning me forward. </p>

<p>I'd murdered June. I'd be obsessed with her, and heartbroken when I discovered her affections lay elsewhere. </p>

<h4>[WP] John Cena has died. He finds himself in Valhalla eagerly awaited by the great warriors of history. None of them are aware of pro wrestling's staged nature</h4>
<p>Score: 3234</p>
<p>Another gigantic hand hammered into John's shoulder, but this time he was ready and did not stumble. The crowd had roared with laughter when Vismar the Red had made Cena almost fall to the floor, as he had "merely" welcomed him with a clap on the back and John had not dared stumble since. </p>
<p>These men, these gigantic men, they loomed over John and slopped their foul smelling alcohol on him as they cheered him and pulled him through the crowd. This was a dream, it must be a dream, but as tightly as he screwed his eyes up, or pinched himself, the world did not go away. </p>
<p>John had always been one of the largest men in the room, but the average height here was approaching seven feet tall and the muscles were hard knots that had been earned by swinging heavy meta, not by pumping iron. it didn't make sense, none of it made sense, he was supposed to be flying to Orlando for a veterans match against Randy, not here, not... wherever he was. </p>
<p>He looked down at his hands again, they were smooth and felt strong, like they had when he was twenty nine and at his physical peak. He flexed his fingers and watched as each muscle in his arm responded in kind, it was... incredible. His body was sculpted, tight, ready to go, he hadn't felt this good in... in decades.</p>
<p><strong><em>"JOHN CENA"</em></strong> The voice boomed across the room and made John's head snap up, he'd barely paid attention to where he was going since his arrival, but now the men in front cleared to the side and made a path. Ahead was a gigantic gilded throne and on it was the most massive man John had ever seen. </p>
<p>The voice was like trucks accelerating in a tunnel, deep, booming and indicating incredible power. <strong><em>"GREETINGS JOHN OF CENA, YOU ARE MUCH WELCOMED HERE IN VALHALLA"</em></strong> </p>
<p>The crowd was suddenly silent and the huge men seemed to be awaiting his response. He smiled weakly. "Okay, hi." There was a moment's pause and the crowd roared in laughter. </p>
<p>On his throne the huge man wiped away a tear and nudged the man nearest him <strong><em>"FORSOOTH! CLASSIC CENA, JUST CLASSIC!"</em></strong> </p>
<p>The men still laughed and John  looked around, confused. "I don't... I don't really get it. What's going on here?" </p>
<p>Finally the laughter subsided and the huge man controlled himself. <strong><em>"VERILY, I AM SORRY JOHN, WE SHOULD NOT LAUGH, BUT WE HAVE FOLLOWED YOU FOR MANY YEARS IN YOUR BATTLES AND... WELL, WE'RE PRETTY HUGE FANS."</em></strong> </p>
<p>This place was getting to him; John slowly turned and took it in. there were faces all around, bright and eager to hear what he had to say, but... they were warrior men, huge leather-bound and covered in scars. He'd come here on a horse with a fat woman and he was in the body he'd owned many year ago. "I'm dead?" </p>
<p>There was a silence and the room was suddenly filled with eyes that would not meet his. <strong><em>"INDEED, I KNOW THAT IT IS HARD FOR A WARRIOR TO ACCEPT, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO VALHALLA MY SON, WHERE THE REWARD FOR A LIFE TIME OF BATTLES IS TO  FEAST AT THE SIDE OF ODIN!"</em></strong> </p>
<p>Slowly things began to make sense to John - this was a gig. He'd seen these expressions day in and day out on the road, wide eyed and excited. These were <em>fans</em> and he was here to perform. Dead, dreaming, it didn't matter, all that mattered was that he was here to entertain. For forty three years John had stepped into the ring and left it all out there and now it was time to do it again. </p>
<p>The crowd had begun to murmur, but silence sharply fell as his hand shot into the air, fingers splayed. With great care, John reached down and deliberately paused, before pumping up his sneakers twice and then jumping to his feet. </p>
<p>"You brought me here to Feast Odin? You think I want to spend me days getting fat and slow? What? You wanna go? I'm here to battle, I'm here to fight, you betta take fright, because I'm Mister Friday Night!" The old words came back easily, the promo flowing as it always had. </p>
<p>Odin leaned over to the man nearest him and whispered excitedly. <strong><em>"THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD, LOOK, HE'S GETTING ALL WORKED UP AND HE'S..."</em></strong> John ripped off his shirt. <strong><em>"OOH, I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DO THAT, I TOTALLY WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY IT."</em></strong> </p>
<p>"Stuff that old man, I came here to <em>get busy</em> and all I see here are a bunch of old men and..." he paused and confusion crept into his voice. "What looks to be my accountant Ted in the corner." Ted waved miserably to John. "So am I gonna get a match or what?" </p>
<p>Odin smiled widely. <strong><em>"INDEED JOHN, WE HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR MANY YEARS. AS ONE OF THE BRAVEST WARRIORS IN EARTH'S HISTORY, WE HAVE PREPARED A MATCH SUITABLE TO YOUR LEVEL."</em></strong> </p>
<p>The crowd parted again and a gigantic man walked forward, over eight feet tall and with muscles bigger than John's head. His sword was nearly five feet long and seemed to split the air with a slight tearing noise. He was bound from head to foot in spiked metal armor, with only his face showing, allowing John to see his scarred face, teeth sharpened to spikes and a demonic smile. </p>
<p>Odin waved his hand casually. <strong><em>"OF COURSE, IT WILL NEED TO BE A BATTLE WITH SOMETHING ON THE LINE, SO WE WILL PIT YOUR IMMORTAL SOUL AGAINST KRATHNAR THE INVINCIBLE'S. OH AND HONESTLY JOHN, WE'RE SUPER EXCITED FOR THIS, WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AGES, SO TRY NOT TO FINISH HIM OFF TOO QUICKLY."</em></strong> </p>
<p>John deflated, "Wait, what? What do you mean immortal soul?" </p>
<p><strong><em>"OH DON'T WORRY, HE'S NO UNDERTAKER, JUST PUT ON A QUICK MATCH, BREAK HIM IN TWO AND WE CAN GET TO FEASTING. WATCH OUT FOR THAT SWORD THOUGH, IT'S DAMN SHARP." Odin chuckled. "NOT THAT YOU'LL BE WORRIED I'M SURE."</em></strong></p>
<p>John backed away. "And I don't get a weapon at all?" </p>
<p>The crowd roared with laughter and even Krathnar smiled. Odin leaned forward with a grin <strong><em>"OH JOHN, ALWAYS WITH THE QUIPS. CLASSIC CENA"</em></strong> </p>

<h4>[WP] A man orders a "cheese pizza with no crust" from a local pizza delivery joint as a joke. Unbeknownst to him, that pizza joint is a drug front and he just placed an order for a kilo of cocaine.</h4>
<p>Score: 3205</p>
<p>At the sound of the doorbell, I heaved myself from my seat. </p>
<p>I moved over to the door, ready to go on an angry rant about the time. Who the hell thought two in the morning was a good time to turn up at your house? They could’ve woken me up! They didn’t, but they could’ve, and it’s the thought that counts.</p>
<p>I opened the door and my words died on my lips. A man in a pizza deliveryman’s costume stood there, smoking a cigarette and flanked by two burly men in tracksuits. Behind them, a bright red SUV was parked, its lights off but engine still gently running.</p>
<p>“Uh…hi?”</p>
<p>The pizza man dropped his cigarette. “Show us the money first.”</p>
<p>I glanced around. “Am…am I being robbed?”</p>
<p>The man snorted. “Robbed? Hell no. We’ve got the best prices around.”</p>
<p>I looked at the symbol on the man’s hat and came to a sudden realisation. “You’re from Notmafiosos’ Pizza Parlour!”</p>
<p>“Hell yeah, I am. Now where’s the money?”</p>
<p>“I called you guys six hours ago.” Prank-called them, to be specific, asking for a ridiculous order. Come to think of it, I hadn’t even given them my address.</p>
<p>The pizza man snorted. “What, you thought we were gonna come in broad daylight? And people don’t normally ask for such massive amounts.”</p>
<p>“I only asked for a cheese pizza with no crust.”</p>
<p>“Man, what do you mean ‘only’? It would take years to get through a cheese pizza without the crust. What do you normally buy?”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. “A Hawaiian pizza with no cheese or pineapple.”</p>
<p>The pizza man’s eyes widened. “Holy shit, dude. Are you some kind of millionaire?” He turned back to one of the men. “This guy’s a real buyer; go get the product.”</p>
<p>The man nodded and headed back to the SUV. He rooted around in it for a minute before turning the lights on, revealing a myriad of logos for Notmafiosos’ Pizza Parlour that I somehow hadn’t seen before.</p>
<p>He returned soon, clutching a briefcase, which he handed to the pizza man, who laid it on the floor and clicked it open, revealing a pristine pizza box. Slowly and carefully, he stood, and then handed it to me.</p>
<p>“It’s all in there, dude.”</p>
<p>What the hell were these guys on about? I opened the box.</p>
<p>“Guys, I didn’t order a box of flour.”</p>

<h4>[WP]Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?</h4>
<p>Score: 3203</p>
<p>So get a load of this. I had this idea.  I was thinking, how am I going to kill one of the most antagonistic political figures of the 20th century? <br />
I thought, hey, a sperm whale--- <br />
It started with a sperm whale anyway. I was just going to drop a <em>sperm whale</em> on him. Then I realized, I wasn't going to get points just for subtelty or difficulty. <em>Anyone</em> can drop something on someone. Hell, the third winner used an ambulance. Points for creativity <em>and</em> irony that year. <br />
Then, I figured it out. An <em>homage</em> to the old days of this noble sport. <br />
So I went back to a further time, earlier in the era. Found this old man, and asked him what he thought of some paintings I brought with me. <br />
Here's where we pick up the pace.   <br />
I asked him about <em>Adolf Hitler's</em> paintings. He thought out loud as old men always do (even in the 20th century!) and said, he never heard of him, but the painting technique was "disappointing."<br />
Then I asked him to repeat himself, and say, "Adolf Hitler's art, was disappointing."  <br />
So he did.<br />
I asked him to <em>yell</em> it, tell all who would hear a master's opinion of this work. <br />
<em>JUST</em> as he was about to respond, I teleport him over Hitler making a public speech in Berlin three decades later. You can see this old man <em>zooming</em> down into the sky. In the tape, you can barely see Hitler raise his eyebrows. <em>That's</em> when he realizes someone was yelling his name from above.<br />
You have no idea how difficult it was calculating the <em>exact</em> velocity to get the old man's adrenaline going, give him time to speak, and have Hitler hear him.<br />
And there! That's how I pulled it off.<br />
I killed Adolf Hitler by dropping his painting idol, Rudolf von Alt, far above his head, <em>while</em> he was yelling out his opinion of Hitler's paintings for all of Berlin to hear. It was the last thing he ever heard.  <br />
And Rudolf called his paintings <em>crap!</em><br />
The bonus points for intricacy <em>and</em> emotional devastation got me the victory.    </p>

<h4>[WP] Your roommate is literally the Devil. Surprisingly, he is the best roommate you ever had.</h4>
<p>Score: 3082</p>
<p>I pulled the cellophane-wrapped pieces of meat from out of the fridge and checked the label. Useless, of course. Though I was grateful that Satan always kept the fridge fully stocked, I just wish that he would go to a grocery store that sold things in English. Everything that he brought home was marked with like, ancient Sumerian cuneiform or something. </p>
<p>"Satan, what is this?" I asked, holding up the package over the counter in the kitchen so that he could see it from the living room. He looked just like any other guy. Tall, kind of lanky, with black hair and black eyes. Not breathtakingly handsome, but not too bad either. And when he spoke, he had just the slightest hint of an accent that I just couldn't quite place. Probably because it wasn't from anywhere on Earth. </p>
<p>He was deep into a game of Battlefront, enjoying frying some rebel scum as the Emperor. You'd think he'd get tired of that sort of thing (given what he does for a living) but apparently not. "Uhh, what does it look like?" he asked, not taking his eyes off of the screen. </p>
<p>I looked back down at the pieces of meat. It was pinkish. "It looks like pork chops," I told him. </p>
<p>"Gah!" he shook the controller violently; someone had killed his character. Finally he looked up at the package in my hands with a swift glance. "Yeah, totally pork," he answered.</p>
<p>"You sure?" There were some parcels in the fridge marked "DO NOT EAT" (in English, for me) that he got for his demon friends that occasionally came over. And they looked <em>very</em> similar to pork. </p>
<p>He squinted at the cuneiform writing. "Yeah, it's pork."</p>
<p>"Cool." I ripped open the packaging and put a pat of butter into a pan. "You want some dinner too? Cider-glazed pork chops?"</p>
<p>"Sounds awesome!" he said, going back to his game. </p>
<p>I hummed as I cooked. It had been a long time since I'd done that. There was just something so comforting about listening to the sizzling pan, mixed with the sound of explosions and blaster fire coming from the TV (as well as some intermittent shouting from Satan as his Tie fighter was shot down). And the smell of the onions sauteing. And the warmth coming from the pan. It just felt... like home. </p>
<p>There was a loud thumping on the door, like someone was trying to get in with a battering ram. Satan glanced at me with a quizzical look, then towards the door. "I got it," He got up from the couch just as I started to move away from the pan. "You keep an eye on my dinner," he said with a grin. </p>
<p>I heard the creak of hinges, followed shortly by Tom's voice. My blood ran cold immediately. "Where's Sarah?" he shouted at Satan. </p>
<p>"And who might you be?" Satan answered calmly. I had told him about the situation when I moved in, of course. That I'd just gotten out of a relationship, and that it hadn't exactly ended well. But I really hadn't gone into all the details about <em>why</em> we'd broken up, and <em>how</em> Tom had acted when I finally broke the news to him. Satan didn't need to know that. That was between me, Tom, and the cops who had responded that night. </p>
<p>"Her <em>boyfriend</em>," Tom answered. Even without seeing him, I could tell that he was itching to pick a fight. "Now <em>where is she?</em> We need to talk."</p>
<p>"You know," Satan told him, "I don't think she really wa..."</p>
<p>"It's ok," I interrupted him, coming into the hallway behind Satan. "It's fine. We can talk."</p>
<p>Tom had a smug grin on his face, and he glared at Satan. "Yeah. We just need to talk. So butt out."</p>
<p>Satan was still standing between the two of us. He glanced at me with his thick black eyebrows arched, silently asking 'you sure you're ok with this?' I gave him a very slight nod, and he backed away and let me pass into the doorway. </p>
<p>Once Satan went back into the living room, Tom grabbed me by the wrist and pulled me out onto the porch. He reached around me and slammed the door shut. "What the <em>fuck</em>, Sarah? You're <em>already</em> shacking up with some other guy?"</p>
<p>"We're not <em>shacking up!</em>" I shouted back at him, though my voice was breaking with fear. "He's just my <em>roommate</em>."</p>
<p>Tom scoffed. "Yeah, <em>bullshit</em>. Was this already going on when we were dating?" He clenched his teeth and breathed heavily through his nostrils. "I swear, Sarah, if you were cheating on me..."</p>
<p>"I <em>just</em> told you," I shouted back at him, "There's nothing going on between us! And besides, it's none of your business. I <em>dumped you</em>, remember?"</p>
<p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw his hand clench into a fist, and rage flashed through his eyes. My body tensed up involuntarily, expecting the blow.</p>
<p>The front door swung open again. "All right, buddy. Time for you to go," Satan told Tom. "<em>NOW</em>."</p>
<p>"Or what?" Tom asked, puffing out his chest and turning away from me. "You going to call the cops? Why don't we settle this like men?" He cracked his knuckles and grimaced, as if he wasn't being clear enough already.</p>
<p>Satan stepped out onto the porch with an affable smile. "Gladly," he answered. "Except..." </p>
<p>He began to grow. It was hardly noticeable at first, but he was Tom's height in just a matter of seconds, whereas he'd been at least three inches shorter when he stepped through that doorway. And not just up, but <em>out</em>. Muscles bulged from his arms and chest and legs until he looked like a bodybuilder. His pale skin turned fire-engine red, and a bristly black goatee sprouted from his chin in a matter of seconds. His affable smile became horrifying and menacing when his teeth became sharpened fangs. And, as a nice little cherry on top, thick ram's horns sprouted from his forehead and spiraled out until the spiky tips were jutting into Tom's face.</p>
<p>"Except I'm <em>not</em> a man," he boomed in a terrifyingly deep voice.</p>
<p>Tom bolted back to his car with a wet stain on his crotch. He didn't even <em>look</em> at me. </p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Satan crowed after him. "I thought you wanted to settle this!" His taunt was answered by the squeal of tires, and a crash as Tom reversed out of his parking spot and straight into the back of another car in the lot. Satan let out a deep, booming laugh and put one massive arm over my shoulder. "Come on, Sarah. We wouldn't want dinner to burn." He led me back inside, and slowly transformed back into his human self.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry you had to see that," he finally told me.</p>
<p>"No, I..." I really didn't have words. Tears began to roll down my cheeks. "No, <em>I'm</em> sorry. For Tom. And for not telling you what an asshole he was. And.. and... thank you, so much. You just... <em>God</em>, I'd give anything for a drink right now."</p>
<p>Satan smirked. "I told you not to use that name in this house." He crossed the room and found a bottle of white wine in the fridge, then poured me a glass.</p>
<p>I reached out to take it, but he jerked it away quickly. "Ah ah ah! Not so fast." He twirled the stem of the glass deftly between his fingers. "You said you'd give <em>anything</em> for a drink?" His smile became wicked and devious. "How about <em>your soul</em>?"</p>
<p>I stared at him in shock, unsure how to respond. As soon as he revealed who he really was, I <em>knew</em> this day would come eventually. I just hadn't thought it would be <em>now</em>. All I could think of was that the onions were starting to burn.</p>
<p>"Nah, I'm just fucking with you," he laughed, handing me the drink. </p>

<p>"Why ya be so defensive, Captain?" Fatman-John asked, in a suspicious tone. "What ya be hidin?"</p>
<p>"Are ya implying something, ya scurvy dog?"</p>
<p>"I'm sayin it be pretty weird that ya never heard of witches in pirate stories," Fatman continued. "And that ya don't let us talk 'bout witches on the boat!"</p>
<p>"Aye!" One-Legged Jimmy agreed.</p>
<p>Bald Nick joined them. "What's this talk about witches?"</p>
<p>From his corner, Golden-Tooth Jackson continued to watch in silence.</p>
<p>"We think the captain be a shape-shifting witch!" One-Legged Jimmy bellowed. "Trying to bring down the ship!"</p>
<p>"That be a pretty big word for a pirate; shape-shifting!"</p>
<p>"One-Legged Jimmy is actually college educated," Fatman-John intervened, with a smile. "We all have a fairly good understanding of grammar and spelling, and the structure of the English language in general. It's just more fun to talk like pirates."</p>
<p>"Aye," One-Legged Jimmy agreed. "Loads more fun."</p>
<p>"Look!" Bellowed Bald Nick, a horrified look on his face as he pointed. Fatman and One-Legged turned to find the 
Captain… or what used to be the Captain.</p>
<p>In his place, a gray-haired, crooked-nose witch in black robes and a pointy hat hovered a few feet from the ground, green smoke rising from the wood under her feet.</p>
<p>"Told ya! The captain be a witch!"</p>
<p>"Well, that be odd," Fatman said, scratching his head.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Cause I be a witch too." Fatman said, turning to a witch not unlike the Captain in front of the other's eyes.</p>
<p>"You be a witch? Then why you be arguing that there is witches in pirate stories?" The Captain asked. "Why you 
not pretending you don't know 'bout witches like me?"</p>
<p>"I be trying to throw you off," Fatman-now-witch replied.</p>
<p>"I'll be darned, me too," One-Legged Jimmy joined, turning into a witch himself.</p>
<p>"Well that makes four of us," Bald Nick intervened, as he too turned to a pointy-hatted old lady.</p>

One by one, the neighbors turned. We watched out of the second story window, because the downstairs was all boarded up. We saw old Mr. Howard biting little Linda Root right there in the street. My family and I watched her corpse bleed out onto the sidewalk, then get back up again an hour later and start roaming the street. </p>
<p>I still don't know how they got to my wife. All I know is that I came back from a supply run, opened up the garage door, and found her sinking her teeth into my shoulder. And that was the end, I thought.</p>
<p>The end. In just a few short hours, I'd be one of them. I could take my own life, of course: it wasn't an unpopular decision. Better than trying to feast on your remaining friends as a ghoul, right? But I couldn't do it. I was a coward. So I did what any man would do: popped open a beer and fired up the riding lawnmower. </p>
<p>For some people, it's basking on a sandy beach with a margarita in hand. For other people, it's jumping out of a plane and plummeting toward the ground until they finally pull that ripcord. For my wife, it was exploring every damn store in the mall for the hundredth time. Everyone has their "zen" activity, and mine was mowing the lawn. She was my pride and joy, and it showed in the lush green color. </p>
<p>It was dark by the time I'd finished up. The rest of the zombies around me could smell the bite. They knew I wasn't long for the world, so they left me alone. Just me and John Deere against the world. I may die soon, but my lawn would live on as a testament to my abilities. Years from now, when the world is reclaimed, someone will come by and say, "Wow, the grass here is shorter and neater than any of the other lots." That would be my legacy.</p>
<p>But somehow... nothing was happening. No fever, no dizziness... none of the symptoms anyone else experienced after a bite. I felt better than ever (though that might have been from the beer, and maybe a touch of sun stroke).</p>
<p>I crawled into bed, at least happy that I'd managed to enjoy my one last day on Earth. I'd probably turn in the night, so I handcuffed myself to the bed frame. One less walker for the survivors to worry about, I guess.</p>
<p>I woke up the next morning with the sun in my eyes and the smell of freshly-caught grass wafting through the window. Well, freshly cut grass and rotting flesh. But we can't have <em>everything</em>, can we? The important part was that I hadn't turned yet. Susan had <em>definitely</em> bitten me; I had the marks to prove it. And she was <em>definitely</em> infected. So what was it?</p>
<p>I fired up the lawnmower again. My lawn was already perfect, but Dr. Metnis's lawn hadn't seen care in weeks. He was one of the first on the block to go. Probably one of the first in the state; he'd been at the hospital when the initial outbreak occurred. One of the very first patients had taken a chunk out of his hand, and we hadn't seen him since. So, I rode over and cut his grass too (and had a few more beers; why fix what ain't broken?).</p>
<p>The bite seemed to be healing. It was something about the lawns. About how it calmed me down. As best I can guess, with my <em>very</em> rudimentary knowledge of chemistry and biology, it's the adrenaline. <em>Fear</em> is what sets off the virus. No one has noticed so far because <em>of course</em> everyone who has been bitten was freaking out. <em>Everyone</em> is terrified nowadays. Murderous, bloodthirsty ghouls, constantly being on the run, fearing for your life from other survivors... there is no more safety for anyone, and thus no more immunity. And the closer someone gets to death, the more they panic, which just speeds up the virus. My final zen ritual of mowing the lawn seems to have saved my life.</p>
<p>So I did what any reasonable man would do: I kept mowing. If I needed to stay calm to avoid setting off the virus, then I needed more lawns, and more beer. So I cleared highway medians on my way between supply runs. I groomed the lawns of homes before looting their supply cupboards. I cleaned up city parks before taking what I needed from stores and pharmacies. </p>
<p>Someday, there will be a cure. I have to have hope that someone out there is working on it; it's all about keeping that positive, zen state of mind. In the meantime, I need to keep going. Luckily for me, there's plenty of grass in America. </p>

<p>Life is but a fleeting breath</p>
<p>For one as old as I</p>
<p>Each passing year, a passing day</p>
<p>Alone, for to love...is to watch love die</p>
<p>Then I met her, my perfect match</p>
<p>The yin unto my yang</p>
<p>She sang to me a perfect song</p>
<p>And to her, my heart sang its true reply </p>
<p>Alas, our days must be so short</p>
<p>They say that time must fly</p>
<p>All good things come to an end</p>
<p>Soon, we will say our last goodbye</p>
<p>I cannot bear to see her go</p>
<p>I cannot watch her die</p>
<p>And so I fled, a shadow in the night</p>
<p>My deepest love a fading sigh</p>
<p>I pray, to whatever gods might hear</p>
<p>That at the end of days</p>
<p>When all the world is said and done</p>
<p>Somehow, she might return my gaze</p>
<p>Time will be time, and as time does</p>
<p>It turned forever more</p>
<p>Empires grew, and nations fell</p>
<p>And yet my heart would never soar</p>
<p>Soon, all was gone, the world was bare</p>
<p>In the blinking of an eye</p>
<p>And there, among the wreckage, stood</p>
<p>The one I sought, a shadow on the sky</p>
<p>The gods had heard my prayer, it seemed</p>
<p>With their power beyond supreme</p>
<p>Her eyes still clear, her face still young</p>
<p>A living, breathing dream</p>
<p>"Why did you leave?" she asked at last</p>
<p>"I've waited all this time"</p>
<p>In answer, I just shook my head</p>
<p>There were no words to fix my crime</p>
<p>"Nothing I can say or do could undo what I've done</p>
<p>To leave you far behind</p>
<p>I know now I should not have run</p>
<p>Forgive me, for I have been blind."</p>
<p>She stopped a moment, hand outstretched</p>
<p>Fate balanced on a dime</p>
<p>And though I have lived for eons since</p>
<p>Those few moments stretched far beyond Time</p>
<p>"I forgive you" were her next words</p>
<p>The sweetest ever heard</p>
<p>She took my hand into her own</p>
<p>And between us, eons blurred</p>
<p>So now we walk, never apart</p>
<p>Through sand and wind and rain</p>

<p>Our Love does live again</p>

<p>Score: 2918</p>
<p>See, what most people don't realise about super speed is that it doesn't just affect your legs. Your entire body moves fast. People never tend to get that because you see guys like Ravel Alton sprinting at three hundred kilometres an hour down the speedway. I mean, it's more impressive <em>visually</em> than what I can do... but I like to think that my abilities are still pretty good.</p>
<p>"Checkmate," I smile, knocking over the white king with my own rook. Valentin, my opponent, stares at me in shock. By the look on his face, my guess is that his ability was mind-reading. It's a good way to become a chess champion, I'll give him that. </p>
<p>But he can't keep up with me.</p>
<p>See, from the femtosecond his finger touched the first piece, I started running through the possible moves in my head. All of them. </p>
<p>Do you know how many possible positions there are after each player moves three times? More than 9 million. That goes up to 288 billion after four moves each. But when you can't move without a wheelchair, and when you have a brain that can scan and memorise information faster than anything else on the planet... and when you also have a lot of time on your hands... you can memorise everything. Every perfect game. </p>
<p>Not to mention, of course... Valentin might be able to read minds. But he can't process information as fast as I can. Which leaves him unable to comprehend the million, million, million thoughts I have every nanosecond.</p>
<p>I can't run. But that doesn't mean I'm not <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>Elizabeth stepped out from the wall and snapped the neck of the guard as he walked past. The guy never had a chance.<br />
Catching his assault rifle before it hit the floor, she lowered his body to the ground and dragged it to an alcove, out of the main corridor.<br />
Five soldiers down now; only ten remained between her and the ambassador. 
As she slipped through the militarised embassy, she reflected on how she had got here - how much simpler life had been just a few months ago.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Liz had started out as a hairdresser, but quickly became disenchanted by the business. Getting to the second level was simple enough - she just had to do enough bowl-cuts - but once she saw the styles progression tree laid out before her, she realised that this wasn't what she wanted to do with her life. Sure, she might one day style for the stars, but that would be small consolation for the time and energy invested.<br />
It was by chance she saw the man on her way back from the salon. Under normal circumstances she shouldn't have even been able to detect his presence - even with his guard down, it was virtually a miracle.<br />
"You have the <em>gift</em>" he told her, "otherwise we would never have met. You shall become my apprentice."  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Two guards fell to quickly timed blows to the neck. Again, they hadn't noticed her until it was far, far to late. Incapacitated, she cuffed them with their own equipment, then pushed them into a small office and locked the door.<br />
Her mentor would have been proud. She was doing well.<br />
Voices came down the corridor and she ghosted up to a pot plant, then became <em>one</em> with the indoor palm. The squad of mercenaries ran right past her and she slipped from cover, continuing on towards her target.<br />
She became lost in her recollections again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
"You might have the gift, but you do not practice enough!" snarled her mentor.<br />
Shamed, she stared hopelessly at the man, his beret waggling as he shook his head.<br />
"I'll... I'll try harder," she offered.<br />
"No, you must go out into the world and hone your skills in the field, only then will you become a master of our craft."<br />
With that, he had vanished, never to be seen again. Elizabeth had cried, raged and pleaded, but Master Rene had never returned.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Bullets flashed around her.<br />
<em>Shit!</em><br />
She hadn't expected there to be auto-turrets. She could fool the minds of men, but not machines.<br />
Panting, she composed herself and <em>focussed.</em><br />
Five deep breaths and she stood, then placed her hands in the air in front of her, moving slowly forward.<br />
Bullets rattled and careened off the force-field in front of her, the metal slugs impacting on the invisible wall as she carefully crab-stepped through the room.<br />
After a fraught sixty seconds, she was <em>through</em> - unscathed by the automatic fire from the twin machine gun turrets.<br />
The door to the ambassador's chamber stood before her.
No doubt it would be trapped.<br />
Standing clear, she carefully shaped her hands and started to <em>pull</em>.<br />
As though guided by invisible hands, the heavy door began to open.<br />
Straining, Liz hauled hand over hand until the door stood open - and a fan of poison darts shot from the lintel, where she would have been standing.<br />
Inside the ambassador cowered behind his desk, a gun in his meaty hand.<br />
"Where are you!" cried the plump man, "who are you?"<br />
Liz allowed herself to be seen.<br />
Terror washed over the man's face as he gazed upon her beret, her suspenders, her white face-paint and black slacks.<br />
"Oh my god," he whined.<br />
Liz smiled viciously.<br />
No one escaped a <em>grandmaster mime</em>.</p>

<p>Score: 2732</p>
<p>Shreds of wrapping paper flew through the air as Gary tore into yet another box. His parents watched from the couch, wide-eyed and amazed at the ever-growing mountain of wrapping paper and ribbons and bows in the center of their living room. And not to mention the thousands and thousands of dollars worth of toys that had miraculously appeared under the Christmas tree last night. </p>
<p>"Did you win the lottery or something and not tell me?" Martin whispered to his wife. "Where did all of this come from?" They'd been scrimping and saving for <em>months</em> to buy Gary that new video game system that he wanted... and they'd still been about a hundred bucks short by the time Christmas came around. So they got him a new bike instead. But not the insanely expensive one that he'd unwrapped first; <em>that</em> had been a shock. </p>
<p>Nancy couldn't even answer. Her eyes were glistening and her smile wavered as Gary brought a present over to her: a slender box, wrapped in green-and-blue striped paper. "I asked Santa for something for you too, Mommy." Tears rolled down her cheeks as she accepted it and managed to thank her son. She opened the box to reveal a diamond necklace that would have looked at home around the Queen of England's neck. Her jaw dropped and she turned to Martin, who was also speechless.</p>
<p>"What's this, Mommy?" They managed to turn away from the sparkling diamonds for long enough to see what had come out of the very large box in the center of the room: some sort of... table.</p>
<p>It was made of glistening black stone that seemed to suck in light. There were deep scarlet candles lining the perimeter, and in the center there was a bone-white sheep's skull grinning back at them. Except the eyes were glowing red, like they were full of fire.</p>
<p>"Honey," Nancy said, dropping the diamond necklace and getting up from the couch as quickly as she could, "Don't touch that. You don't know wha..."</p>
<p>"Dear Gary," he read from a card, completely ignoring his mother's instructions. "I hope you ejn... enjoy all the presents. Just make sure to stad... stand at the table and read this incatnation... incantation when you're done, and we'll call it even." Gary squinted at the paper as his mother tried to tear it out of his hands. "Ut veinma pesreque..."</p>
<hr />
<p>"God damn it," Satan cursed, watching through the eyes of the sheep skull, "He's butchering it! I <em>knew</em> it wouldn't work!" He turned to the assembled demons behind him with flames shooting from his nostrils. "Whose fucking bright idea was it to have a <em>dyslexic</em> kid read the <em>Latin</em> summoning incantation?!"</p>

<p>EDIT: THERE IS NOW AN OFFICIAL SUBREDDIT TO DISCUSS THIS POST AND ITS EXPANSION INTO A FULLY FLEDGED NOVEL. /r/MattsWrittenWord IF YOU WISH TO BE KEPT UP TO DATE WITH THIS STORIES PRODUCTION PLEASE ENTER IT. </p>
<p>"Okay, that never happened in the first place, " I stated simply to the reaper invigilator. "Something is wrong in your base files because after a millenium of analysis and searching my memories I can tell you... that one never happened."</p>
<p>The reaper floated closer to me, it's black trench coat flapping slightly in the non existent breeze of my eternity-vault. I felt sorry for the reapers at times like this, I'd always been stubborn and it probably didn't deserve it. They were born at the same time as our souls were and tethered to us for the rest of eternity. They didn't want it, they didn't need it and the contract was ultimately binding. It was a good thing that my reaper and I got on, otherwise eternity would have been all kinds of messed up. </p>
<p>"It's probably part of an offshoot then, wouldn't be the first time time you've made that mistake," the reaper snarked, drifting over to my record banks. </p>
<p>"Not an offshoot, up top got really pissy last time I made that mistake, never again," I muttered shaking my head. "Look, right there, that kiss. I have full access to all my memories in here and I can tell you that one did not happen." </p>
<p>I would have liked it to though, that much both me and the reaper knew.  I'd studied the offshoot that one had spawned many times before. Love, fortune, joy and a distinctive lack of the money owed that lead to me... dying. It would have been a nice and long life, one of the happiest offshoots there had been. But it wasn't real, that much I knew.  </p>
<p>"You're right..." The reaper clarified, "that's new... that wasn't there the last time we scanned that segment... so how is it there now..."</p>
<p>We both floated in silence for a moment, staring at the erroneous piece of time line.  Nothing like this had happened to us before and the reaper had never heard of it happening to any of the other deads either. It was a perplexing quandary to say the least.</p>
<p>"I'm contacting head office now, keep an eye on your time line,  anything else changes you let me know straight away okay?" The reaper ordered before drawing the outline of a phone, the item materialising near instantly. Damn reapers and their matter manipulation talents, I wish I had matter manipulation abilities, all sorts of fun things could happen then.</p>
<p>I turned my eyes back to the time line,  tracing along from the new change. A heavy lump formed in my throat. The whole thing was twisting and cracking and splintering out of control. Offshoots replacing reality then melding the two together in a strange abomination of the two. </p>
<p>"Reap, my time line is going out of control, get someone in here right now," I ordered. He didnt reply but from the crack of energy behind me I knew the head honcho had showed up.</p>
<p>He wasn't God, he hadn't created humanity, rather the opposite. He was one of the first reapers and had been the one to sort out the department of reaping along with his Human. If it weren't for them our time lines would have been lost to the winds of time, and then what would we have spent eternity doing? </p>
<p>"This better not be another mistake Daniels," the head said, amusement tinting his tone. "By the gods..." he muttered as he drew closer and saw what was happening. </p>
<p>"Is it localised to him?" My Reaper asked and the head nodded in response. </p>
<p>"Someone from the living world is tampering with his time line,  they're trying to find an eventuality where he becomes immortal," the head explained,  his eyes flicking over the twisting lines. </p>
<p>"We never discovered anything like that during our analysis, and we've been here for over a millenia," I said, my voice incredulous. There was no way there was such a time line, and even if there was who would want me to live forever that badly?</p>
<p>"My Human and I have been in this realm for many more thousands of years Daniels, I can assure you that you haven't seen every possibility yet."</p>
<p>The world began to flicker in and out of my vision. I vaguely heard the head swear and my own reaper gasp in pain. They must have found it.  The one where I lived forever. For the first time since death I felt a little flutter of excitement. I was going back to the world of the living... I wonder if I will remember any of this.</p>

<p>"I can produce a recommendation letter from my last job too, if it's necessary."</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Presi – Mr. Obama, I don't think… So you really wanna work at Target?"</p>

<p>"All righty, then," the manager said, stamping Obama's resume with a green 'HIRED'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Second aisle to your left."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Obama!"</p>
<p>The mother and child walked away with smiles on their faces. Obama smiled too. He looked down at the tag on his 
uniform, reading BARACK. The manager wanted Mr. Obama, but Obama insisted on the first name. All he wanted 
was a quiet life now, as a quiet employee of a supermarket, with a quiet first name. No more Mr. Presidents, no 
meetings to discuss the future of the world…</p>
<p>"Hey, Obama!" Mike greeted him on his way to the cashiers.</p>
<p>"Mike! Come here." </p>
<p>Mike stopped and turned around. "What's up?"</p>
<p>"Listen, is there a way we can put the cereal and milk closer together?" Obama looked beyond Mike at the mother 
and child walking away. "That woman was like the third customer today trying to find both. They're five aisles apart, but most people buy them together."</p>
<p>Mike scratched his head. "You'd have to talk to Lester, in Logistics. But – uh – it won't be easy."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, you work Customers, Obama. Logistics people and Customers don't usually get along very well."</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"Meh, the whole issue has been going on for years. You're not the first one to try and bring up ideas to help the 
customers. Logistics and Business always seem to think they know best."</p>
<p>Obama smiled innocently. "That's silly. Where's this Lester's office? I'll talk to him."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you think?" Obama asked.</p>
<p>Lester shook his head in a sarcastic smile. "You people from Customers… you always think you have the answers. Do you have any idea what it's like behind the scenes? The trouble we go through to organize the shelves, bring the supplies? The trouble Business goes through to price everything right?"</p>
<p>"I'm just saying that maybe if we put the cereal and the milk closer together, the customer won't have to –"</p>
<p>"Oh, you guys are always thinking of the customer. Customer this, customer that. Cashiers are the same way. You 
know, sometimes you have to let the customer do the work for themselves. Target can't keep offering a hand to 
anyone who can't stand on their own two feet. If someone can't find the milk and the cereal, maybe they don't 
deserve it. Maybe they didn't look hard enough."</p>
<p>"But it's really no big deal, I'm just suggesting that –"</p>
<p>"Sorry, Obama. We have other priorities for our budget. That's a no."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Told you," Mike said, later, as they made way back from their lunch break. "You'll have a hard time trying to get 
Logistics and Business to back any of your ideas."</p>
<p>"Can't you help me?"</p>
<p>"I work Cashiers, they hate us more than they hate you… always complaining we're soft-hearted fools who don't 
think about the business side, who only want to help the customers…"</p>
<p>"Jesus…" Obama stopped by the store entrance. "So there's nothing we can do?"</p>
<p>"Well… Marketing has a lot of influence with Logistics and Business," Mike said, by the door. "Maybe if you establish 
an alliance with them…"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So you're proposing…"</p>
<p>"That you cut the budget from Marketing for a couple of months, so we can use it to back up the rearrangement of 
the milk and cereal displays," Obama said. "If we see an increase in sales after this time, we'll pass one hundred percent of Cheerios profit to you guys, for a period no longer than a year."</p>
<p>"And if you don't?"</p>
<p>"We go back to the way it was before and establish a fair time frame to pay you back, with interests."</p>
<p>Jonathan from Marketing bit his lips. "Logistics and Business won't like this."</p>
<p>"Yes, but you can turn them around," Obama said. "Can't you?"</p>
<p>Jonathan paused. Then offered his hand. "I'll draft a contract."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is a nightmare!" Mike grunted, eyes fixed on the paper. "It's been three months and nothing!"</p>
<p>"We have one more month in our deal with Marketing," Obama said.</p>
<p>"Do you realize Finance had to cut the price of Cheerios AND two percent milk THREE times already, because of the 
drop in demand?"</p>
<p>"It'll catch up. People are just not used to having them displayed closer together."</p>
<p>"Obama, people are confused. They were used to having milk on aisle five and cereals on aisle one. Now that cereals 
are on aisle two, they don't even bother to look! They're just buying eggs for breakfast and calling it a day!"</p>
<p>Obama sighed. "Well, that's because Logistics and Business set those restriction rules which were <em>not</em> in my 
original deal with Marketing! Milk and cereals were supposed to be side by side, not an aisle apart!"</p>
<p>"It was a compromise, Obama."</p>
<p>"A compromise my ass! Logistics knew that amendment would kill my whole project!"</p>
<p>Lester from Logistics passed by them, locking eyes on Obama. A smile sprouted between his lips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The market's crashed," Jonathan said, as soon as Obama walked in the room. "Obama, this is Will, from Finances."</p>
<p>Will, a fat man in a suit, offered Obama his hand. "We need to act fast. The Cheerio price is dropping like gravity. 
The price is half of what it was last month, and people still aren't buying."</p>
<p>"What about the milk?"</p>
<p>"It's going bad on the shelves. We can't go on like this, Obama."</p>
<p>Obama shook his head, defeated. "All right. Call Logistics, tell them starting tomorrow we'll have milk and cereals in the original aisles again."</p>
<p>"We did that already, Obama," Will said. "I'm afraid it's not enough."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Jonathan and Will exchanged looks. "We're going to have a meeting with Cashiers and Customers tonight."</p>
<p>"Cashiers and Customers? What about?"</p>
<p>"Well, Business and Logistics are blaming you for the Cheerios crash. Now, Mike in Cashiers tells me you had to 
settle for one aisle apart, when the original plan was having them in the same aisle."</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"Maybe your original plan would work, but it's too late now. We have Cheerios representatives knocking on our 
door every day, consumers complaining they can't find the milk and, when they do, it's all gone bad… I'm afraid 
drastic measures must be taken, Obama."</p>
<p>Obama looked from Will to Jonathan. They were serious like death.</p>
<p>"What do you mean drastic measures?"</p>
<p>"We can't afford to have Cheerios pull their product from our stores, Obama. We're establishing a bailout plan for the milk and cereals. The money will have to come from the consumer."</p>
<p>"Oh, for fuck's sake."</p>

<h4>[WP] Superman is mentally handicapped. That's why he thinks nobody can pick up the Clark Kent=Superman thing, and everyone plays along in an effort to keep him from throwing a tantrum. The comics are his idea of what is going on. What does a day in Metropolis actually look like?</h4>
<p>Score: 2657</p>
<p>A scream from half-way across the city woke me up. Without even thinking, I knew where it was coming from - <em>her apartment.</em></p>
<p>I threw on my suit, and threw my super suit over my suit, and wearing both of my suits, I zooped out the window. </p>
<p>With a shattering <em>smack</em>, I crashed through <em>her</em> window. It probably looked really cool when I did that.</p>
<p>There was a man in her bedroom, a <em>naked</em> man, and even though he didn't have a weapon, I could tell he was about to attack her. How could I tell? Because when I burst into her room, she screamed out loud, and said, "Oh no, not again!"</p>
<p>Lois is always getting attacked. That's why she needs me.</p>
<p>But I don't want her to know who I am, so before she could see me, I dashed into her closet, and took off my super suit. I walked out of her bedroom closet, carrying my briefcase, and wearing my glasses, and not even <em>she</em> realized that I was the same person who had just flown through her window.</p>
<p>I pretended to be surprised to see her, "Oh, Lois, <em>you're</em> here?" </p>
<p>She was completely fooled. I could tell by the shock in her eyes - her mouth was an open 'O'. It's easy to trick people when you're Superman.</p>
<p>"Who the hell are you?" the attacker said. He wasn't wearing any clothes, but even in that disguise, I could tell who he <em>really</em> was.</p>
<p>"You don't fool me, Joker!" </p>
<p>I pulled back my fist, and I almost punched him, when I remembered that I was still wearing my Clark uniform. Whew. Close.</p>
<p>I jumped back into the closet, and put on my super suit again, and jumped back out.</p>
<p>By now, Lois was standing in front of the man (she was also naked, but she had a sheet wrapped around her, but she doesn't know that I can see through clothes. I do it all the time. I was doing it then, too. Hehe.)</p>
<p>I guess she was confused because even though I was in my super suit, she said, "Clark - <em>don't.</em>"</p>
<p>"I'm not Clark," I said, "I mean - who is Clark? I am Superman!"</p>
<p>That cleared it up for her. Now she understood that I was Superman, and not Clark. She still doesn't know that I'm <em>both</em>.</p>
<p>"Fine. <em>Superman,</em> get out of here, <em>now.</em>"</p>
<p>She sounded angry, but that was probably because she was being attacked by the Joker. The Joker is a scary guy, because he's always laughing, even when nothing is funny, and that's pretty scary.</p>
<p>I said, "First, I must save you!" and before the Joker could escape like he always does, I threw my arms around him, and crushed him to my chest.</p>
<p>"SUPERMAN!" she shrieked. At first, I thought she was going to <em>finally</em> tell me what a hero I was, and thank me for saving her, and kiss me, and invite me to -</p>
<p>"DON'T YOU DARE HURT HIM."</p>
<p>Now <em>I</em> was confused. Did she <em>not</em> want me to kill the Joker, and finally rid the city of this horrible, blood-thirsty menace?</p>
<p>"PUT HIM DOWN, NOW."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see," I said. Lois was a gentle soul. She would never hurt a fly. I don't usually hurt flies either, but sometimes they buzz around my Sprite cans, so I have to zap them out of the air. Anyway, she didn't want me to hurt him, so I said, "Alright, if that's how you want it. I will take him to - <em>Arkham Asylum!</em>"</p>
<p>Nobody ever plays dramatic music when I say that, so I had to add it in myself. I sang, "<em>Dun dun DUNNNNN,</em>" and you could feel the excitement building.</p>
<p>With the Joker in my arms, I jumped out of the window, flew down to Arkham, and shoved him into the darkest, smelliest cell I could find.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lois ran out of the lobby, praying to herself that Tim was alright. Out on the street, she whipped her head around, looking for any sign of him - or of Clark.</p>
<p>A groan echoed out of the alley.</p>
<p>She rushed around the building - to the dumpster - and found Tim crumpled inside, peeling sticky pieces of trash off of his skin.</p>
<p>"Oh, God, Tim. I'm so, <em>so</em> sorry. I told you he was ..." she let the sentence trail off.</p>
<p>"Lois," he groaned, "Have you ever thought about moving?"</p>
<p>"Tried it. Last time I went to Paris, he tore apart the whole airplane to 'save me from 'Lex Luthor's Evil Machines.' Look, next time we're... next time, I'll keep some broccoli laying around."</p>
<p>Tim gave her an incredulous look. The page of a magazine slid down his cheek and fell with a moist <em>plop</em>. </p>
<p>"He thinks vegetables are poison," she explained, "Anything green and leafy he calls 'Kryptonite'."</p>

<h4>[WP] "I never said she stole my money" - This sentence has 7 different meanings depending on the stressed word. How much of them can be put in a story?</h4>
<p>Score: 2645</p>
<p>"<em>I</em> never said she stole my money. Tina's the one who said that."</p>
<p>We were seated at the police station, across from a very frazzled looking officer. My friend Tina replies:</p>
<p>"Bullshit, Jo, you told me last week it was her!"</p>
<p>"No, that's not true. I <em>never</em> said she stole my money."</p>
<p>"You called her a 'dirty rotten thief.'"</p>
<p>"Right. But still. I never <em>said</em> she stole my money. I only implied she stole something from me."</p>
<p>"But then later you said that $50 was missing from your purse!"</p>
<p>"That's also true, but I wasn't talking about her. I never said <em>she</em> stole my money."</p>
<p>"Jo, stop fucking around. You said she owed you hundreds of dollars."</p>
<p>"Right again, Tina, but wrong again in the implications you've drawn. I never said she <em>stole</em> my money. Just that she borrowed it and never paid it back."</p>
<p>"So how is she a thief?"</p>
<p>"Well, I never said she stole <em>my</em> money, but when we used to work together, she got fired for stealing from my boss. And, I never said she stole my <em>money</em>. But she did walk out of my house with my favorite vase after a New Years Eve party. Weirdest thing, too, <em>she</em> came up to me to give me a hug with it under her shirt. . ."</p>
<p>The frazzled looking detective dropped dead in his chair. An autopsy would show that he died of a spontaneous brain aneurysm.</p>
<p>The moral is that you can fit all permutations of the sentence "I never said she stole my money" into one story. But it will probably sound so confusing and contrived that one of your secondary characters may die of pure bemusement.</p>

Oddly enough, you just got an email titled "Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard."</h4>
<p>Score: 2544</p>
<p>I broke my fixation on the woefully empty bottle of beer to glance down at my phone as it <em>dinged</em>, notifying me about an email. I sighed. Debt collectors and spam. That's all I ever got anymore. At least the latter allowed me the pleasure of pressing the fun little trashcan icon. </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change...</strong>, the preview of the subject read. Hell, yeah. I would give anything to change everything right now. My girlfriend was gone on some escapade with her not-so-secret lover, my student loan debt was three times what I made in a year, pre-taxes, the eviction notice was still taped to the door... I hadn't been too broke to buy beer since college, but here I was. Same old.</p>
<p>I swiped right and typed in the double 69 password; a relic from more cheerful times. The email was short and to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very hard.</strong> Seemed about as legit as the Nigerian prince my grandpa was always helping out. My finger hovered over the trashcan icon but my phone <em>dinged</em> again, the echo bouncing off the walls of the nearly empty room. A text this time with the same message and a simple instruction: <strong>Reply YES for details</strong>. I shrugged and typed the message, arching my eyebrows skeptically as the message <em>whooshed</em> away and I turned back to the bottle hoping to leach out a couple more drops.</p>
<p><strong>Pick your level: First World Problems, Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard</strong>. I sighed. Whoever this was, they were persistent. A cruel joke, most likely. Getting my hopes up that my life could be anything more than a miserable shit hole. I chose the first option and hit send, shrugging in mild irritation before sighing and heading to my bed. Without the electric bills paid and nothing to entertain me, I was sleeping by dusk, my schedule more Amish than an Ohioan's. My phone rang a moment later, just as I was settling in and starting to tell myself a bedtime story.</p>
<p>"Mom?" I said hesitantly, surprised that she would call after six months of not talking to me. She let out a muffled sob and I sat up in my bed. "What happened?"</p>
<p>"It's dad..." she stuttered as she struggled to catch her breath. I frowned. My dad had been getting cigarettes since '95 and if he was suddenly showing up now, I wanted nothing to do with him. "Your grandfather passed away," she said quietly and I scowled. Disrupting my 8 o'clock bedtime for this? The man was a grade A dumbass and had provided more for random hookers than he had for me.</p>
<p>"I... I'm sorry," I managed to say half-heartedly.</p>
<p>"You barely knew him," she answered softly. "I can't see what he saw, but he must have thought very highly of you. He left you his fortune and the house by the lake. You're rich..." she said mournfully and I quietly gulped as I tried to fathom the idea.</p>
<p>"Goddammit," I sighed knocking my head against the headboard of the bed. "I'm gonna have a shit ton of taxes to do."</p>

<p>"It's such an honor to meet you, Mr. Langley," said the giant demonic figure before me. His smile seemed both genuine and terrifying.</p>
<p>I trembled before him. I tried to convince myself it was just a dream.</p>
<p>Satan extended his hand before me. His red skin looked like it was melting but not dripping. His fingernails had to be the length of my middle finger. He eyed me curiously as I left hanging what must've been a handshake offer.</p>
<p>"So," he said, clearing his throat. "I am a bit surprised." He looked me over a bit. I'm sure he noticed my shaking knees and the downpour of tears streaming down my cheeks.</p>
<p>He continued, "I wasn't expecting, uh... Er... Forgive me, Mr. Langley, but I'm just confused.. I, uh, thought you'd be a bit... Well, more intimidating than..."</p>
<p>He paused, collecting his thoughts.</p>
<p>"Well, it doesn't matter," the Devil said, waving a hand above his head as though to dismiss his thoughts. "It's great to have you here! I'd like to introduce you to so many people!"</p>
<p>Satan grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled me along. He pointed to a large, fiery river. "That's where the casuals go. You know, the people who probably would've gone to Heaven if they didn't suck one too many cocks or stole a Pok'emon card in elementary school," he said.</p>
<p>My knees buckled and I fell hard. Satan quickly helped me to my feet, apologizing for the rocky terrain we trudged on. </p>
<p>I heard moans and cries left, right, ahead, behind, above and below us. Fear isn't a strong enough word to describe the feeling that engulfed me.</p>
<p>We came along to an open pit with moaning souls reaching up, some begging for water while others simply begging. "Lucifer, pease..." I heard one woman moan. Satan spit in the pit. The wad splattered on the pit wall. The moaning souls fought each other towards the disgusting gloop. One girl, who I would've sworn was just a mere child, reached it by climbing the stony wall a bit. She licked and sucked the wad, a look of euphoria overcoming her face. The rest of the helpless sinners groaned and turned back to Satan, begging for more "water."</p>
<p>The Devil laughed and pushed me along. "Desperate fools," he said, grinning at me. I wouldn't doubt his teeth could carve through diamonds. "Some of those fuckers are Romans. Did you see the fattest one there? The one who the little girl climbed over to drink my nasty spit? He's Buddha!"</p>
<p>I wanted to ask why Buddha was in Hell, but the words wouldn't leave my voice box.</p>
<p>We made several more stops. Each one terrified me more than the last. And at each stop, Satan reiterated that these places were not for me. I don't know if it was possible, but I felt more frightened at the thought of my punishment.</p>
<p>We moved past serial killers, rapists, terrorists and lawyers. What could I have possibly done that warranted a worse punishment than these people?</p>
<p>Eventually, we entered an area that was not full of doom and gloom. There was pleasant greenery, shrubs growing with beautiful pink flowers blossoming, large trees that I would've loved climbing as a kid, a quiet waterfall ahead, and cute, small animals frolicking about.</p>
<p>"You're surprised, huh?" Lucifer asked. "I built this place to piss off God. Why should he have nice, beautiful areas to hang out in, and not me?"</p>
<p>We walked towards what appeared to be a mansion the size of ten football stadiums. The entire house was covered in gold. Two demons ahead pushed two giant, golden doors open for us. "Your darkness," they greeted, bowing before us.</p>
<p>Inside the large mansion were people standing around, drinking liquor and eating foods one would only find in 5-star restaurants. The people were excited to see me. They gathered before the Devil and me. Many held out their hands to touch me as Satan pushed me along through the rooms.</p>
<p>He introduced me to Adolf Hitler. I was appalled. This man was responsible for millions of deaths, yet here he was, lounging about with delicacies everywhere and two young, attractive, busty women at each arm.</p>
<p>Next, we met an Egyptian princess named Cleopatra II, who was introduced to me as the daughter of Cleopatra and Ptolemy V. Satan said the ancient Egyptian rulers were in Hell for inbreeding.</p>
<p>We met Stalin and Mussolini. Harvey Lee Oswald was close by, munching on shrimps by the boatload. A creepy-looking, dirty man was introduced to me as the Zodiac Killer.</p>
<p>We met Socrates ("He fucked little boys," Satan informed me.), Genghis Khan, Ivan the Terrible, Josef Mengele ("Auschwitz physician"), Elizabeth Bathory ("You don't wanna know."), Kim Jong Il and even Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein hurriedly greeted me before rushing off to bathe. Apparently, he enjoyed staying clean.</p>
<p>We met the worst human beings I had ever heard of, and we even met the worst human beings I never knew about.</p>
<p>Finally, Satan invited me into a private room. I gulped. <em>This must be it</em>, I thought. <em>He's going to ass fuck me. I hope I don't shit myself...</em></p>
<p>The room was dark but well-decorated. Paintings hung from the wall; a large chandelier towered above us; candles were lit, giving an incredible scent to the room.</p>
<p>Satan pointed me to a plush chair. It was velvety, soft to the touch and undoubtedly comfortable. But I couldn't relax.</p>
<p>He said across from me. Between us sat a table with two clean glasses and a large bottle of Crown Royal whiskey on it. The demon poured the drink into the glasses. The bottle magically refilled once Satan placed it back on the table.</p>
<p>He handed me a glass and said, "Drink up, my friend. We have much to discuss!"</p>
<p>I took a small sip and just eyed the devil. He downed his entire glass in one gulp, then leaned forward to pour more.</p>
<p>"You've killed a lot of people," he said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"Ex-excuse.. excuse me?" I stammered. Killed people? Me?! I could barely kill a fly!</p>
<p>"Oh, relax," Satan said, downing yet another glass full. "Ooh... I love this Canadian shit. They brew a mean whiskey."</p>
<p>"Sir, I-I-I've never.. nev--never.. I have nev---" I continued to stammer.</p>
<p>"God can't hear you here, Mr. Langley. Relax. You're safe. He thinks I'm punishing everyone, but there are some of you earthly sinners who intrigue me."</p>
<p>He drank and drank, the bottle never emptying, always refilling after every poured glass. I took another sip. I felt parched, but I knew alcohol wasn't going to help.</p>
<p>Satan then asked me about my kill ratio. I sat stunned. What did he mean?</p>
<p>I continued to deny ever murdering anyone. I could see my demonic captor's expression slowly change. He went from excited to annoyed.</p>
<p>"Listen, Mr. Langley," Satan sternly said. "I've seen your record. It shows you've killed several million people from the age of 6 until the day of your death. Hitler and these other assholes may have killed millions, but they didn't actually do the majority of the dirty work. You have! Now, stop fucking with me. I've invited you as a guest into my home. At least speak to me like a man and not some bitch with a stutter."</p>
<p>I mustered all my courage. "Look, Mr. Lucifer," I began. I immediately felt fear return as I stared Satan in his yellow, dreadful eyes. I chugged down my Crown Royal to build confidence and then stared at Satan's forehead to avoid his eyes.</p>
<p>"What?" Satan asked, rubbing his forehead. "Is there a pimple on me?"</p>
<p>I took a few deep breaths before saying, "Lucifer, there's been a mistake. I have not k-kill-killed a single human being in my life. I lived in my-my-mmmmy parent's basement and, uh, and surfed Reddit in between playing hours upon hours of Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto. I-I-I'm, I... I am pretty sure you're mistaking me for someone else."</p>
<p>Satan raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Furthermore," I continued, "I am a virgin. The last time I touched pussy, uh... Last time I-I-I-I touched vagina was on mmm-my way out of my mom's. I shouldn't be here. There are actual rapists outside this, umm, room. I'm-I'm..."</p>
<p>Satan facepalmed himself.</p>
<p>The smack of his palm across his forehead thundered in the room.</p>
<p>"Fuck..." he quietly said.</p>
<p>We sat in silence for what felt like an eternity. Satan leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. He sighed before turning back to me.</p>
<p>"Look, kid. We fucked up. I'm sorry," he said, sighing again. "But now there's nothing I can do to change this."</p>
<p>I felt myself cower into my chair.</p>
<p>"Relax," he said, noticing my fear emerge once again. "You didn't do anything wrong... Uh, I mean, you were a loser, but it wasn't your mistake. This has happened many times before. You losers spend all day playing your PlayBox One and your XStation 4. You actually get into the game and start imagining you really are Super Hilario and Monkey Dong or whatever. That fucks up our system and shows you guys as some bad ass killers when, in fact, you're a bunch of nerds with no aspirations."</p>
<p>He went on to explain that if I kept my mouth shut and just pretended that I was a murderer, he'd give me the royal treatment instead of dumping me in a pit somewhere or having his henchmen have their way with me. I agreed.</p>
<p>We got up to exit the room, but Satan stopped me.</p>
<p>"When you get out there, everyone will want to talk to you. I expect you to pretend you're one of your game characters and just make your stories believable. Can you do that?" he asked.</p>
<p>I replied, "Absolutely."</p>
<p>He grabbed the doorknob and began to turn it, but then turned to me and said, "Oh, and one more thing: you can't be Snake or whatever that Metal Gear Solid shit is. Someone else already told us stories about that."</p>
<p>"Aw, man..."</p>

<h4>[WP] Death always lets the doomed challenge him to any sport or game to save their lives. Death comes for a six-year-old boy. Death doesn't remember learning about Calvinball.</h4>
<p>Score: 2504</p>
<p>For pity, perhaps, he went along with it, even though the rules made a final win impossible. If a few millenia had taught him anything, it was that this process need not be painful. Not in the moment. Later, when the realization of loss reverberates in and around those left behind, the pain would be as real and unavoidable as the sky. But that was not for him. He would be long gone. All that mattered was the boy. Would he come quietly, in peace?</p>
<p>He lay the scythe behind a tree and chased the boy with the golden hair, dusty orange stuffed tiger clutched close to his chest. The boy was unperturbed by this stranger. The boy explained the game - utter nonsense, he thought but did not say - and he agreed to the parameters. He hummed and harmonized with a Tum Tum as the song proclaimed the beginning. He grabbed a flag.</p>
<p>"Tag!" the boy shouted, "for four points!"</p>
<p>"Tag back," he said as he extended a bony finger, "for four!"</p>
<p>"No no no," the boy said, "the flag is now the Spire of Protection, so I am safe and you must recite Happy Birthday while Hobbes dances."</p>
<p>He obliged as best he could, his voice warbly and raw. He could not remember the last time he sang.</p>
<p>"The mask!" the boy said as he approached with a rag with two holes. </p>
<p>The dark man took the mask and wrapped his skull. They ran with waving flags. The ball flew through the sky, a brilliant red rubber ball shining against the white clouds above. The warm fall sun brought sweat to the boy's brow. The dark man had long ago lost his last bit of sweating flesh, but he still knew the heat. </p>
<p>"What is the score?"</p>
<p>"Seven to Washington," the boy said breathlessly. The disease was thick in his lungs. It would not be long.</p>
<p>"Hobbes has something to say," the boy shouted. </p>
<p>"What is that, Mr. Tiger?" the dark man said, his skepticism and detachment both eroded by the boy's effervescence.</p>
<p>He was startled as the tiger transmogified into a larger, vibrant, living version of itself.</p>
<p>"He's tired," the tiger said in a whisper. </p>
<p>"His life... so real, so unyielding," the dark man said. "I don't think he will come."</p>
<p>"Allow me," the tiger said.</p>
<p>He took the boy's hand and held it close.</p>
<p>"Calvin," the tiger said.</p>
<p>"You're it!" Calvin shouted.</p>
<p>"No... Calvin, it's time to rest," the tiger said. </p>
<p>"But the sun!" he said.</p>
<p>"Come with me," the tiger said. He lead the boy hand-in-hand to edge of the glade. </p>
<p>"We have a magical world ahead. Let's go exploring."</p>
<p>The dark man lifted his scythe and followed the two, treading lightly lest he disturb them. The tiger brought the boy into the light, and then they were all gone. Behind them the leaves steadily fell on the soft glade and the grass and all the world left gave a silent elegy. </p>

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 2474</p>
<p>“So where are ya heading?” Jim asked, his turning down the secluded dirt road. It was his favorite spot for murdering thus far. Granted, it may have also been his only one thus far...</p>
<p>The woman had hardly said a word since he picked her up. She seemed bored, constantly staring out of her passenger window. It was all wrong. He liked to get them comfortable before doing the deed.</p>
<p>“Just the bus station,” she said.</p>
<p>“Really?” Jim raised an eyebrow. “What’s a pretty little miss like you needing to ride a gross bus for?”</p>
<p>“My mother’s in the hospital.”</p>
<p><em>Shit</em>, he thought. <em>It’s okay. Deep breaths, you can fix this.</em></p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Jim said with faux concern. He checked his gas light. The red light had flashed long enough. Just a little bit more…</p>
<p>Like an answer to his prayers, the truck began to sputter. It shook, the arrow on the speedometer slowly descending to zero. He frowned, hoping the woman wouldn’t see glee behind his mask. He didn't want to make her nervous. </p>
<p>“Dammit,” Jim barked as he banged on the steering wheel. “I’m out of gas. We’ll have to pull over.”</p>
<p>The woman shrugged, silent as ever. Something about her gesture made Jim nervous. He had never seen a hitchhiker look so indifferent. Yet, he liked it. She was his first true challenge.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jean stood to the side as Jim fiddled with the oil pan of his car.</p>
<p><em>He really is a moron, isn’t he? People are usually a little suspicious of hitchhikers but he’s treating me like a long lost friend. Shame, since I’ll be slitting his throat any moment now.</em></p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Jim called, breaking her thoughts.</p>
<p>Jean blinked, turning in his direction. The man had a goofy grin as he looked back at her, a streak of grease on his cheek. <em>A true idiot</em></p>
<p>“What?” she asked, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>“Well, I was wondering if you could give me a little help over here. It’s a tad complicated.”</p>
<p>“Putting gas in your car is complicated?”</p>
<p>“I never said I was a mechanic”</p>
<p>Jean sighed, walking over to help the dimwitted man. The closer she got, the more she noticed something… <em>off</em> about him. His demeanor, the way he hid a hand behind his back. She had practiced the same thing a thousand times before. It was a ploy - a bad one at that.</p>
<p>“What the fuck?” Jean furrowed her brow, backing away. “You have a knife, too?”</p>
<p>“What?” Jim began to sweat profusely. He wiped his forehead, revealing the gleam of a butcher’s cleaver in his closed fist. “Ah shit, wrong hand. But it's not what it looks like. I just keep this to check the fuselage and… wait, did you say ‘too’?”</p>
<p>Jean reddened, pulling her jacket closer to her body. The chilling sensation of the blade's flat side brushed against her side. So much for keeping her weapon a secret.</p>
<p>“Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t,” she started. “What’s it to you?”</p>
<p>Jim smiled, still cheery but different. Somehow more pleasant.</p>
<p>“You’re the Hitchhiking Murderer!” he said. “I’ve heard about you while watching TV. I must say, I’m a fan of your work.”</p>
<p>Jean stood flustered. “I… uh, thank you?”</p>
<p>“Jim Miller,” the man extended his hand. “I’m still new to the scene but I guess you could say I’m your opposite. I like to kill hitchhikers, rather than be one. I'll tell you, I never thought we’d cross paths this way. You’re even more beautiful than the rough sketches of you on the ten o'clock news.”</p>
<p>Jean blushed. <em>He can’t be serious.</em></p>
<p>“Thanks,” she paused. “So, are you not going to try and kill me?”</p>
<p>Jim shrugged. “I guess not. We don’t have to compete in the same pool for our victims so there’s no need to be territorial, right?”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>“So it’s settled.” Jim smiled. “We’re cool.”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Jean backed away, her eyes still glued to Jim's knife. He appeared friendly but if she learned anything, it was she couldn’t take chances. Yet, something told her he would stick to his word. He may have been a killer, but he was the earnest type.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she said, standing on the edge of the forest. Her voice echoed in the brisk night air as Jim perked his head up in anticipation of her words. “Next time, don’t make it so obvious that you’ll run out of gas. I could see you glancing at the meter every few seconds. And for the love of Christ, don’t show your knife until you’re about to kill someone. It's reeks of amateurishness. Don't give a bad name for the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Jim nodded, giving her a thumbs up. “You got it! Maybe one day, I’ll show you how much I’ve improved. I'll earn my name as an established serial killer and make you proud.”</p>
<p>Jean fought back smiling herself. <em>Stupid as ever</em></p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said, melting into the safety of the foliage. “Maybe one day.” </p>

<h4>[WP] Ok, bad news, good news. Bad news: you've died and have gone to Hell. Good news: since so many humans have died in recent years, humans have long since outnumbered demons 1000 to 1 and turned Hell into a pretty nice place.</h4>
<p>Score: 2474</p>
<p>"It was the Nazis that did it," the tour guide explained. "A bit ironic, really. Hell was already far overcrowded, but most damned souls were too beaten down and dejected to do anything about it. But there were so many soldiers pouring into Hell during the last days of World War II that the demons just couldn't process them fast enough. They had to set up these big temporary camps to house them all until Satan could personally determine their worst nightmare to torture them. Well wouldn't you know it, the Nazis didn't really like being herded together and put into camps! So they led the uprising against Satan's minions." </p>
<p>The guide's high heels clicked against the marble floor as she walked over to a massive painting, at least the size of a football field, depicting the first battle. According to the little placard, this had taken Caravaggio six years to paint. Post-uprising Hell was full of some incredible artwork, now that the great masters had been released from their prisons and were given limitless time and resources to make what they need. Even the Atrium that contained the waiting line to get into Hell made the Louvre look like an Alabama garage sale. </p>
<p>"Chancellor Hitler proclaimed amnesty for all past crimes committed up on the surface and dedicated himself to building this new utopia. Really, it was perfect for him and his many followers: the Jews, as God's Chosen People, are almost all up in Heaven. It seems that God cares more about the status of the tip of your penis and whether you eat pork than whether you were a virtuous person. So, no 'Final Solution' necessary in Hell.  Hitler restored order and even put the demons to work conjuring whatever society needs."</p>
<p>She led the way to another portrait, easily recognizable by the thin toothbrush mustache. The portrait was by Michaelangelo, who seemed to have taken the rejection from Heaven rather personally. He'd done a whole series of statues on the hypocrisy of the Bible and God himself. Another nearby picture showed Hitler summitting Lucifer's black stone throne and throwing Satan himself into the Abyss. "It's apocryphal, of course," the guide assured us. "In fact, no one knows what happened to Lucifer. He managed to flee in the midst of the fighting. Some say he returned to Heaven and asked for God's forgiveness. Others suggest that he's hiding out somewhere on Earth, trying to build his kingdom anew there."</p>
<p>She led the way to the next exhibit, where a video showed Dr. Sigmund Freud establishing a psychological institute to help the damned recover from centuries of torture. It turns out that God wasn't a big fan of psychologists; something about how they had usurped the traditional confessional role of priests or something. He didn't care too much that they were just trying to help people. There's a little saying in Hell that God's rules are about as fixed and permanent as a gust of wind. Shit, most people here thought that they were pretty pious back when they were still alive. You'd be shocked at just how many popes there are down here. "Everyone pitched in," the guide narrated as the video showed a montage of humans filling in the pits of fire and brimstone, and planting farms and gardens. No one needed to eat down here, it was just nice to have fields and pastures. "Everyone did their part to make Hell a better place." The video ended with an overview of the massive city skyline, full of flying cars and all sorts of other futuristic concepts. You'd be surprised what Einstein, Da Vinci, and uncountable other geniuses could accomplish with unlimited time and resources. </p>
<p>The final exhibit on the tour was titled <em>The Future.</em> "Chancellor Hitler's vision of Hell is not limited to just creating a paradise here," the guide continued as we walked through the door. "Though Hell has been retaken from the demons, there are still <em>billions</em> of souls on the surface, suffering and toiling through God's tests. Trying to scrape by on meager food because God thinks hardship will inspire faith. Trying to fight greed and lust because God has taught them that they shouldn't enjoy food and flesh. Torturing themselves when they should be living their lives as they want. Just like we do down here."</p>
<p>The exhibit was not grandly decorated by works by famous masters. The walls were bare and the room was hardly lit. Only a single bulb illuminated one exhibit, a small glittering object of metal gears and glass panes. "This is a prototype," she said, "Of the machine that will open up The Doorway."</p>

<h4>[WP] Soul mates are real and technology has finally allowed for detection of some peoples “other half" at the speed of light using quantum messaging. When you were tested there was no response, now 10 years later you are called in to let you know a response has just arrived.</h4>
<p>Score: 2447</p>
<p>I'm probably the only person in the world who was happier <em>before</em> the Match Database was invented. </p>
<p>I went on my eighteenth birthday with my twin brother Erik as soon as we were eligible for testing. The line stretched around the block, as it was still a fairly new technology back then. There were still people in their pre-Match relationships, which don't really exist now. Nowadays, the only people who need to use the service are those who are just coming of age. The thing about the Match Database is that you only ever need to use it once. "Soul mate" means a companion for life, and once you've found that one, there's never a need to use the database again. Unless you're like me, that is.</p>
<p>Erik found his match right away. He sent out the standard message with his name, contact information, etc. And the response came back immediately from his soul mate, Trinh. I still remember his beaming smile, and he was already on his smartphone booking a flight to Vietnam. And then I stepped up to the terminal and put my hand in for testing. The machine glowed blue, indicating that a match had been found and a connection set. So I sent the message.</p>
<p>I looked around the clinic, not sure what should have happened. It seemed like Erik's response was instantaneous. All soul mates were roughly the same age, so most were tested around the same time and could message back and forth almost immediately. "It's all right," the clinic tech answered. "Sometimes it takes a while, like if your match is asleep at the moment. It happens a lot with all of the different time zones. Just go home and wait for the answer."</p>
<hr />
<p>I've been waiting for ten years now. Ten long years of having every person I know rub their happiness in my face. Erik and Trinh, married now, are really the only ones who at least try not to make me feel bad about it. But even between them, I can <em>feel</em> their energy. Their strong connection. And their happiness. And it always just reminds me of what I'm missing out on. </p>
<p>I used to hate dating back in high school before I got matched. I really did. I was shy and clumsy and tongue-tied and I never knew what to talk about. You have <em>no idea</em> what I'd give to go on an awkward blind date now. There are no more single people left. That's not an exaggeration: <em>everyone</em> has used the match clinic and found their soul mate. As far as I know, I'm the only person who never got a response. I've heard of people waiting up to a year, but no further than that. </p>
<p>I try to maintain a normal life. I have a studio apartment, which are a rarity nowadays. Most of them have been combined into spacious one-bedrooms for all of the couples out there. At least the lack of demand leads to some pretty cheap rent for me, right? The only way to survive as the only single man in the world is to stay positive. </p>
<p>At work, I'm a fairly solitary person. I keep my head down and get my work done on time. I eat lunch at my desk while everyone else usually meets their soul mate for an hour or so mid-day. A lot of them go out for happy hour and such afterwards, but I usually head straight home. You'd think that being with friends would cheer me up, but it just reminds me that I'm an eternal third wheel. At least my cat and my TV don't have soul mates to rub in my face.</p>
<hr />
<p>I went into the Match Database clinic the other day. The bored attendant was certainly shocked to see me, a 28-year-old man. Everyone my age had been Matched successfully a decade ago. "Um... can I help you?" he asked. </p>
<p>"I want a new match," I told him. </p>
<p>He looked down at the machine, then back at me. "What?"</p>
<p>"A new match!" I yelled, louder than I'd intended. I pounded a fist on the counter and glared at him. "How hard is that to understand?"</p>
<p>He shrank back against the far wall and pushed the machine toward me. "I don't think that's how it works..." he stammered. </p>
<p>I picked the machine up and smashed it to the ground, where it exploded in a spray of plastic bits and wires. Just for good measure, I kicked a few of the pieces and then stormed out.</p>
<p>That was the night I tried to commit suicide.</p>
<hr />
<p>"David?" It was Erik, as usual. He's generally the only person who calls me now that Mom has passed on. "I think you need to come over here." </p>
<p>I sighed and rolled over to check the clock. 10 A.M., far earlier than I normally woke up now that I'd lost my job. "Why?" I asked. It was a question that I'd been asking a lot recently. Why go on?</p>
<p>"Just come," Erik said. "It's worth it, I promise."</p>
<p>I grumbled, but in the end managed to get out of bed and scrape together the effort to shower and dress. If it had been anyone other than Erik, I would have just hung up. </p>
<p>I pulled up in front of our old house, where Erik and Trinh now lived with their little daughter, and took a deep breath before exiting the car. It seemed like everything was a chore nowadays, and I was just too tired to continue. Half of me wanted to just drive back home and crawl back under the covers and wallow in my own pity for a while longer. But then I noticed the car parked in the driveway. Not Erik's, nor Trinh's. And curiosity got the better of me. </p>
<p>The doorbell chimed cheerfully, and Trinh answered the door with a wide grin. "David!" She wrapped her arms around me in a big hug. "I'm so happy you came!" She was normally a pretty upbeat person, but this was over the top even for her. Maybe she was overcompensating for the cloud of gloom that hovered over me at all times. "Come in!"</p>
<p>She led me into the living room, where Erik was sipping coffee with the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. Long black hair flowed over her pale shoulders, and she had sparkling, vivid blue eyes. </p>
<p>"David!" Erik said as I entered the room. "So great to see you. <em>This</em>," he gestured to the woman, "Is Candice."</p>
<p>Reality came rushing back, and I remembered who I was. Like everyone else, Candice would have a soul mate. How could she <em>not</em>? My constant stormclouds reappeared.</p>
<p>"It's a pleasure to finally meet you," she said softly. </p>
<p><em>Finally?</em></p>
<p>"Candice here has been in a coma," Erik said. He could barely contain the eager enthusiasm in his voice. "For the past <em>eleven</em> years. She said that she heard your name and address in a dream."</p>
<p><em>Eleven years...</em> My mind had stopped working.</p>
<p>She batted her eyelashes. "I got your message, David."</p>

<h4>[WP] A group of Viking encounters a Siren at sea, her voice is luring the men to their doom - except one. Now it's up to a closeted gay Viking to save the day.</h4>
<p>Score: 2437</p>
<p>Bjarke heard a melodious voice sail over the sides of the longship, weaving promises in the minds of those around him.</p>
<p>For the love of Odin, he thought, rolling his eyes. It's a damn Siren.</p>
<p>He looked at his men, who were entranced by the hypnotizing voice and moving close to the railing. If he didn't act soon, he'd lose his whole daft crew in seconds to the cunning beast. Bjarke spent the next several minutes strongarming his magicked crew into the belly of the longship before bolting the door shut from the outside. Lucky for him, his mother had been a witch and he was able to knock them out with a simple spell. That would prevent any of them from hacking a hole in the side of his ship. He worked hard to build it and Bjarke wasn't about to let some song-drunk idiot sink it.</p>
<p>The lilting voice grew stronger as the Siren tried to beckon the men. Bjarke stepped up to the railing.</p>
<p>"For Thor's sake, shut the hell up, you hussy!" he shouted over the gray water.</p>
<p>He saw head pop out of the water, rage written on her beautiful features. In an instant, the silver-haired Siren was at the side of the longship and scowling up at him.</p>
<p>"Hussy!" she shrieked. "Listen here you sansorðinn! I may be a lot of things but a hussy is not one of them. I will drag you down to a watery death."</p>
<p>Bjarke give her an amused smile. It would be a joy to tease this creature.</p>
<p>He brought his meticulously cared for nails to his face for inspection before saying, "What could you possibly need with all the men on my ship if not to be a hussy."</p>
<p>The woman sputtered in shock before summoning a wave to push herself onto the boat's deck. Bjarke yelped in surprise as he was soaked from head to toe. Great. This was one of his nicest shirts and now it was covered in seaweed and salt water. Blinking the stinging water from his eyes, the Viking saw the Siren stand up, her scaled tail disappearing now that she was no longer in the water. She stood before him naked, her long silvery strands of hair covering her breasts.</p>
<p>"You listen to me," she hissed, poking him in the chest with sharp fingernail. "I am Iona, a magnificent creature of the sea descended from Ægir himself. I will not be reduced to the image of a wanton woman by the likes of you."</p>
<p>Bjarke merely stared at Iona, unperturbed.</p>
<p>"Why are you not affected by my singing," the Siren asked, suddenly curious. "You are a male of a hale and hearty stock. You should have been one of the first to respond to my beckoning."</p>
<p>Bjarke's eye twitched. Yes, she would think that, wouldn't she. This was a secret he had kept close always. A secret that, if revealed, would come with a price. He was not ready to lose all he had worked hard for.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well. Not all of us are tricked by your charms."</p>
<p>Iona pursed her lips and circled him like a vulture.</p>
<p>"Hmmm," she said, tapping a finger to her lips. She glanced down towards his groin. "Are you lacking the needed equipment?"</p>
<p>Bjarke glared at her.</p>
<p>"I have perfectly working 'equipment' thank you very much."</p>
<p>Iona's perfectly shaped brows raised up high in realization.</p>
<p>"You're fuðflogi," she said, breathlessly. "That makes so much sense."</p>
<p>The Viking shushed the Siren harshly.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said in a hushed voice, despite the fact they were the only two conscious on the longship. "But no one knows."</p>
<p>"It is not an evil thing to desire the love of another man," Iona said to the burly, bearded man.</p>
<p>"Not everyone sees it that way," he said gruffly, running his hand over his braided blonde hair. "I will have to marry soon or else they will know."</p>
<p>"I will make you a deal," Iona said, taking sudden pity on the man. "I will help make you the most feared viking in the world if you take me away from this Odin-forsaken spit of land I've been stuck on. "</p>
<p>Bjarke looked at the silver-haired maiden curiously.</p>
<p>"You are a Siren," he said. "Can you not travel the waters freely?"</p>
<p>"Not as freely as you think," she said, sadly. "If I am captured in my human form, I am bound to them and the magic chaining me to this barren place will be split. I will instead by chained to you until you die."</p>
<p>"I would not wish that on anyone," he said.</p>
<p>"It is what I wish. It seems it would not be so bad to be chained to you until your death," Iona said thoughtfully. "I will appear as your wife and help you claim the world. Then we will both be free. I am able to mask my voice as to not charm your village. All you need to do is bind me to you through blood."</p>
<p>Bjarke looked at her, considering her offer. From his belt he drew a knife, slicing a shallow cut down is arm. He held it out to Iona, who mimicked his actions.</p>
<p>"Deal."</p>

<h4>[WP] Do the crime, do the time - but the reverse is also true, you can choose to serve jail time in advance of any crime you want to commit. After voluntarily spending 50 years in prison one individual is set to be released and the world watches in anticipation of whatever they do next.</h4>
<p>Score: 2409</p>
<p>After fifty years of willing incarceration, I left. My time had been served with no crime to its name, and now, I could put that time towards any offence I chose. A smile played at my lips.</p>
<p>The world watched as I took my first step from prison. Underfoot, the pavement created a mosaic: the hard, blackened crust of society cracked under the steady press of nature. I watched it, silent. The click of cameras and shouts of reporters faded from my ears. The rays of the sun flowed over me, and my lungs filled with fresh air until every dark nook that had festered for fifty years was eradicated. I released the darkness in a breath. At the hiss, the nearest camera man squeaked and scurried back. My smile grew.</p>
<p>The pavement crackled as I took another step. Around me, the ring of humanity expanded. Fingers tightened around microphones, faces paled, and arms shook. The power of it surged through me with my next breath, and a chuckle broke free.</p>
<p>I stepped again, then again. The crowd expanded, and the mosaic crumbled further underfoot. I was not trapped; not by walls, or barbed wire. Not by guards or guns. Not even society could hold me, for I had embraced the punishment it offered and come out the other side unbroken.</p>
<p>I left the crowds behind and fear in my wake. Yet, it was not me they feared; it was what I carried. For years, people believed me imprisoned while they walked free, but in truth, it was the opposite. While their walls of rules and intimidation grew, mine fell away. Now, I was free, and in my freedom they saw their prison. And they knew they would never leave. </p>

<p>Reginald,</p>
<p>I had a dream last night, dearest brother. A dream of the future. It left me most dyspeptic, and I fear in what may come to pass.</p>
<p>I walked through cities empty of signs of industry. No smoke stacks rising, no coal fires burning, no sound of horse hooves on the streets. They were barren, and though the motor car had continued the march of progress, everywhere seemed to be shops selling little better than children's toys. </p>
<p>I would like to speak of our home as paradise in the future, yet it was paradise lost. The Manor is a grand home, full of life and love. Yet in that future it was but a tawdry museum, a relic for the common man to walk around, to poke and to prod and see how the upper classes once lived. Our descendants had no business stopping them. They were on the edge of bankruptcy, and the house required more to maintain than the land income generated. </p>
<p>There were no maids or butlers in my vision, either. Such jobs had long since died out. Fearfully, women had the vote, using their small minds to wreck havoc on the economy. Moral bankruptcy was everywhere. Those of, shall we say, foreign tastes, were no longer sent to gaol. God was forgotten in preference to the cold clinic of reason. And the vulgar tastes in clothing meant even the highest in society revealed more flesh than a fallen woman plying her trade.</p>
<p>And who were the highest in this nightmare? Why, not the ministers of government, seen with derision for their efforts. Nay! The music hall entertainer was the pinnacle of social achievement! Or a sportsman, playing common games such as football! </p>
<p>The Empire was lost, too. India, Canada, Australia - even our holdings in China. All gone. Queen Victoria's empire was consigned to the history books. Instead we had built some form of locomotive tunnel to France, allowing the continentals easy access if they wished to invade us. The navy that had spawned Nelson and Cochrane now numbered too few vessels to stop even a tug boat.</p>
<p>Thank our Lord it was but a dream. For none appreciated the burdens of privilege in that future. Anyway, I must leave you now. When shall I come and visit? It is but a two day trip to reach you in the country, after all. It has been three months since Mary died of polio, and I could use the company.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<h4>[WP] You're a 12 year-old in a world domintated by magic. A small, feeble man appears on your doorstep claiming: "You're a scientist, Henry"</h4>
<p>Score: 2362</p>
<p>Henry and Roy shuffled into the cafeteria along with the other forty first year students who would be starting at the East Brighton Preparatory Academy. The other students, already seated at the tables, barely looked up from their meals. It didn't look much like the Great Hall of Hogwarts that he had seen in Mum and Dad'said photos. Instead of a thousand floating candles and a stormy sky, Henry just saw dirty ceiling tiles and fluorescent lights. And there were no long wooden tables with silver platters of food, but instead scuffed red plastic tags and dented aluminum trays heaped with something that almost looked like macaroni and cheese.</p>
<p>"This must be the Sorting!" Henry whispered eagerly to Roy. "My father told me all about it!" He searched the room for any noticeable banners to see what the different houses were, but he couldn't see any. No matter; the muggle's version of the Sorting Hat would surely explain it. </p>
<p>"Sorting?" Roy grunted. "Sorting <em>what</em>?" He was muggle born, after all, so of course he wouldn't know how it was done at Hogwarts.</p>
<p><em>Do the muggles not do sorting?</em> Henry wondered. That didn't make sense. Haggard had even brought him to a Muggle library so that he could learn a bit more about his school before the first day; they'd used a machine that Haggard had called an "internet." There, he saw pictures of mascots and all the bright colors, just like the Gryffindor lion. And while they were at the Muggle's version of Diagon Alley (Called "Shopping Mall,") Haggard had explained that all the boys would be split up to live in different areas of the school. There had to be a sorting, right?</p>
<p>"You know," Henry tried to explain, "Like, where they split us all up and decide what house we're going to live in."</p>
<p>"Ohhhh." Roy nodded understandingly. "Yeah, 'at's what <em>this</em> is for." The young girl in front of Roy turned right then and passed a stack of papers to him. They weren't the yellowish parchament that Henry was used to; just plain white squares covered in black writing. Roy took one for himself and then passed the stack to Henry. </p>
<p>Henry studied the options, each with a little blank check box next to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Windsor Building, Dorm A</p>
<p>Windsor Building, Dorm B</p>
<p>Churchill Building, Dorm A</p>
<p>Churchill Building, Dorm B</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Errr...." Henry wasn't sure if this was right. Where was the Hat to make the decision? "You just pick one?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Roy answered, seeming a bit confused. "Wotchu think, Henry? Want to room together?</p>
<p>"Sure!" He didn't have to stop and think about it. Regardless of what House they chose together, it would be good to be with a friend.</p>
<p>"Well, my brother Doug was in Churchill B 'is first year," Roy explained. A roguish grin spread across his face. "'e said that it's got a pretty good view into the girls dormitory across the quad! I say we grab that one!" The girl in front of Roy turned around and shot daggers at him along with a look of disgust. She was likely trying to figure out which dorm was <em>not</em> across from Churchill B.</p>
<p>Henry looked back down at the paper. "Well... what attributes does House Churchill fit best? Because I think that I'm fairly studious and intelligent, but my <em>father</em>'s house was known for being brave and those things tend to run in the family." He frowned; this really would be easier if there was just a hat to the decision.</p>
<p>Roy's face screwed up in confusion. "Henry, you're a weird bloke. What the hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"You know..." This was so frustrating! Henry'd never had to deal with Muggles before. "Isn't our house supposed to match our personality?"</p>
<p>Roy laughed. "It's just a place to live, Henry. It'll be a bunk bed and a desk with a little lamp on it. Probably broken, if what my brothers all told me is true. That's about it."</p>
<p>"Oh." Henry looked down at his paper. "I guess Churchill B will be fine then." He looked around for someone passing out feathers to write with, but there were none. Just some little orange sticks topped with what looked like bubblegum. Roy took one and pressed it against his paper, and it made a mark in the box, so Henry copied him. Just like that, it was done. That was the muggle version of sorting. </p>
<p>Roy and Henry turned in their forms and were shepherded into a different line. They were given trays and walked past a counter with a glass sneeze shield. A frumpy old woman ladled heaps of orange goo onto their trays from a big metal bin that was indeed labeled "macaroni and cheese." Henry couldn't see a single noodle in there. Then they found their way to tables and sat in no particular order; Henry didn't even know who the other members of Churchill B were yet.</p>
<p>"So this is the feast?" Henry asked, poking at his goo. Roy had already devoured half of his portion. </p>
<p>"Yep!" Roy said. "But don't get used to it. My brothers said the food gets worse after the first night. They're trying to make a good impression and whatnot." He followed that sentence by shoveling another forkful into his mouth. </p>
<p>Henry looked down at his orange blob. He decided he didn't like being a scientist very much. </p>

<p>Jack looked back in his rearview to see Mike yawn audibly from the backseat, tapping absently on a bottle of root beer as they crawled on the interstate.</p>
<p>"Can't you go any slower?" Mike said. Jack couldn't help but concede that Mike had the right to complain- he'd confiscated all the booze and insisted on driving, after all. </p>
<p>Jack ignored him and drove on in silence. He was way under the speed limit, but the last thing he wanted was for a creature or person to dash in front of their headlights, starting a night of misadventure to hide the dead body.</p>
<p>Jennifer, sitting on the passenger side, frowned. Her peroxide blonde hair wafted in the wind.</p>
<p>"Oh, no! There's no network." </p>
<p>Mike scoffed. "Who cares, Jenn? We're on a camping trip. The point is to get away from civilization for a little while."</p>
<p>"No worries, I bought a satellite phone with extra batteries for this trip," Jack brought out a Nokia from his pocket.</p>
<p>Mike rolled his eyes. Then his eyes widened.</p>
<p>"Would you look at that?"</p>
<p>"Woah!" Jenn exclaimed as she looked at a small dirt road that forked off the asphalt. It was blocked by a rusty old gate that carried an ominous warning for trespassers.</p>
<p>"That padlock," Mike said, "is older than my grandpa. I bet we can break in. The view looks gorgeous too- what the fuck?"</p>
<p>Jack swiveled the car and floored it till the gate was out of sight. Then he slowed back down to under the speed limit.</p>
<p>"Ain't no way we're going in there. Go alone if you want to."</p>
<p>"You're such a killjoy, Jack," Jennifer said.</p>
<p>Killjoy- Jack smiled at her choice of words. <em>I can be as joyless as needed</em>, he thought, <em>as long as I'm not killed</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The tents were up and the campfire rustled. It was a small clearing in a state park that the Parks and Wildlife Department had certified safe for campers. Jack had scoured the internet to double check. He didn't find any creepy legends or strange sightings in any of the forums.</p>
<p>Jack lay down in his tent and checked the batteries on his flashlight.</p>
<p>"Hey, Jack. " Jennifer snuck inside the tent coyly. She gave a flirtatious half-smile as she lay down next to him. </p>
<p>"Oh hell no!"</p>
<p>Jennifer sprang back, she wasn't used to this reaction.</p>
<p>Jack had seen too many movies. Sex was practically the harbinger for a gruesome death. There was no way he was having sex in a forest on a dark, moonless night with a pack of coyotes wailing in the distance.</p>
<p>He looked at her glassy eyes still recovering from the rejection. Feeling bad for her, he lied.</p>
<p>"It's not you, Jenn. It's me. I'm gay."</p>
<p>""What? But what about Stacie-"</p>
<p>"I just realized this morning. Don't tell Mike, or anyone else for that matter. Please?"</p>
<p>She took her clothes and left.</p>
<hr />
<p>Despite all precautions and traps set by Jack around their tents, something had attacked their camp and they were on the run. They panted as they stopped upon a bifurcation in the hiker's trail.</p>
<p>"We should split up," Mike said.</p>
<p>Jennifer nodded in agreement. Jack looked at them in amazement.</p>
<p>"Are you fucking kidding me?"</p>
<p>"What? It will be easier. We split up, find some help, then come back in this exact same spot and we're all safe."</p>
<p>"El fucking oh el."</p>
<p>"Jack, look. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I need you to show some teamwork here."</p>
<p>"Over my dead body. I'm gonna follow you guys and I'll be in the middle. Mike, you lead. Jenn, you follow."</p>
<p>Mike and Jenn sighed, but finally agreed with Jack as they heard their pursuers closing in.</p>
<hr />
<p>Twigs snapped and branches slapped on their faces as the three of them ran. It had been a good decision to let Mike take the lead. The monster- or whatever it was attacking them, had come from the front.</p>
<p>Mike, who'd already been stumbling, finally fell down.</p>
<p>"Shit!" He screamed in pain.</p>
<p>Jack and Jennifer looked back at Mike, hunched on the ground, clutching his ankle in agony.</p>
<p>"You two go ahead- I'll be fine," he said, waving his hands, taking his voice an octave higher, trying hard to sound heroic.</p>
<p>"Good idea," Jack said as he turned to run.</p>
<p>"Hey! I was kidding, obviously. Help out, dude. You've gotta carry me."</p>
<p>"Did that thing bite you?"</p>
<p>"Did it what?"</p>
<p>"Did it bite you?"</p>
<p>Mike didn't reply. His hand subconsciously grazed over his shoulders, where, Jack noticed, there was a deep gash.</p>
<p>"Fuck you, I'm outta here."</p>
<p>Jennifer looked at Jack running through the thickets. Then back at Mike, who was now lying on the ground like easy prey. She said a quick sorry and ran in Jack's direction.</p>
<hr />
<p>The monsters had cornered them. </p>
<p>Jack cowered behind a fallen log. Jenn started making nervous noises. She was having a panic attack.</p>
<p>He thought of putting a hand to her mouth and trying to soothe her out of it. But he could hear the footsteps of the creatures coming closer and closer.</p>
<p>Nice guys finish last, Jack. He reminded himself. With a quick hit under the nose he knocked her unconscious.</p>
<hr />
<p>They seemed to be safe for the moment. They had lost the monsters. Jack's shoulders were aching from carrying an unconscious Jenn. </p>
<p>"Where are we?" She asked, there was a drowsiness in her voice suggesting that she was still not out of it.</p>
<p>They entered an area of low growth and in front of them was a small cabin.</p>
<p>"Oh look, a cabin in the woods. We're saved!"</p>
<p>Jack could see a confederate flag hanging from one of the windows. On the yard two holes had been dug out. Six feet under, human-sized.</p>
<p>"Hey! We need help!" Jenn called out.</p>
<p>Jack put her down. He could hear highway sounds not far away.</p>
<p>"You seem to have regained consciousness. Good luck with the creepy cabin dude, I'm out of it."</p>
<p>And with that Jack ran in the direction of the highway, noping the fuck out of a sleepover at the creepy cabin.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jack was glad to have reached civilization as he waved at the passing cars.</p>
<p>A station wagon with "Free Candy" scribbled with key scratches on the rusted hull stopped by him.</p>
<p>"Need a ride?"</p>
<p>"No thanks." Jack said, and started moving along the road.</p>
<p>The man looked disappointed but drove away.</p>
<p>After waiting a bit, Jack saw a squad car approach.</p>
<p>He couldn't control his joy. He had escaped the ordeal. He had survived in a horror movie setting despite being black. This was a story he was going to tell his grandchildren. He jumped and waved frantically at his uniformed saviors.</p>
<p>The cops got out and screamed into the radio.</p>
<p>"We found the suspect! Suspicious black male, blood splatters on his t-shirt."</p>
<p>"Down on the ground!" The other cop shouted.</p>
<p>"No, no, you've got it wrong." Jack tried to calm them down, his palms up front, facing them.</p>
<p>"Suspect acting hostile, I repeat suspect acting hostile..."</p>
<p><em>Bang! Bang!</em> The other cop emptied his cartridges and Jack lay on the street, blood pooling on the asphalt in an ever-enlarging puddle.</p>

<p>Before me stretched an impossibly long hallway. Big, imposing, steel bulkhead doors lined the concrete walls. Sickly lights that were evenly spaced along the hallway provided illumination. Everything was in a state of decay. The lights flickered on and off. The steel doors were rusted and some of the tiles on the floor were missing. Bloodcurdling screams could be heard all around you along with twisted laughter and grotesque fapping. It was hard to think in all of this noise.</p>
<p>Satan lead me down the hallway. He had a smug grin plastered on his face and it hadn't changed once since I first met him. The demon was completely red. His entire body was completely red. He was also naked. I didn't dare to ask why.</p>
<p>There were little circular windows on the bulkhead doors. In one room I saw an emaciated old man surrounded by food. Cakes, freshly cooked meat, ripe fruit and glistening wine. It all looked like something right out of a commercial. The man was trying to shove as much food in his face as possible, only to gag and hurl it back out.</p>
<p>In another room there was a woman covered in bloody red eyes. She tore at them with her fingers, screaming as she did so. In yet another, a teenage girl was being surrounded by six little toddlers. Each of them were eyeless, skinless little things that poked at her with hot iron pokers. There seemed to be thousands of these little rooms.</p>
<p>Satan put one burning red hand on my shoulder and guided me onwards. He grinned smuggily. His smug levels seemed to have increased tenfold. I tried to ignore what was poking me in the thigh. Satan led me to a door that looked like all the rest.</p>
<p>"Well, sport! This one's yours. I know it might be a bit hot in the summer, but atleast you don't have to worry about heating bills!", Satan grinned smugly. He pointed finger pistols at me. I stared at Satan. A man behind me screamed as he was being flayed alive. </p>
<p>Satan shoved me into my personal cell. "Enjoy enternal damnation, Mrs. Pierce!", he said as he disappeared with a poof. The bulkhead closed on it's own and I was faced with my worst nightmares.</p>
<p>Snakes. Thousands of them. They were a piled up on eachother. When I entered the room, they all hissed to greet me. One particularly large cobra was as thick as a tree and as long as seven men. The cobra rose to face level and hissed at me. I slowly raised my fist.</p>
<p>And booped it. On the nose. So many sneks and an enternity to boop them all. My face lit up with a smile. I hugged the cobra, cradling it in my arms. I never noticed how Satan called me Mrs. Pierce. Too many sneks. </p>
<p>. . . M E A N W H I L E . . .</p>
<p>In front of Mrs. Rachel Pierce was a large football field. The bulkhead door spun shut behind her. The sky was blue, the birds were chirping. Handsome, sweaty football players tackled eachother on the field. When they noticed her, they passed the football to her. She jumped and caught it with both hands, clutching it to her chest. </p>
<p>"Oi! You weak-legged cunt! Come join us for a game!", the incredibly buff football player yelled at Mrs. Pierce.</p>
<p>And yes, Mrs. Pierce's legs were particularly weak in this moment. This was her fetish. This was like, all of her fetishes.</p>
<p>She let out a small "Yesss!", before joining them with a smile on her face.</p>

<p>"Yes, thoughts. So when you <em>think</em> of the electron as a wave, that's how it'll behave. When you think of it as a

<p>Johnson frowned. "What if I think of it as both?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" I replied. "Excellent question."</p>
<p>Johnson waited, but I didn't say anything. "Are you going to answer it?" he asked, after a moment.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"That's when electrons intertwine with themselves and become indestructible. One electron will behave as a

<p>Johnson nodded. Silence took over the room for a second.</p>
<p>"How about the Theory of Relativity?" Johnson asked, after a second.</p>
<p>"Well, Johnson, relativity is like drinking eight cans of beer in three minutes."</p>
<p>"How's that?"</p>
<p>"It feels wrong at first, then you feel good about it for a while, then it feels wrong again and you realize you didn't

<p>"Kinda lost track of that analogy halfway through there, didn't we?"</p>
<p>"You're pissing me off, Johnson. Cut it out."</p>
<p>"What are you gonna do about it?" Johnson got up. "Your story sucks anyway, dude. I'm out of here."</p>

<p>THE SONG 'I KISSED A GIRL' PRESENTED IN CONTEXT OF THE 21^ST CENTURY</p>
<p>Katy Perry, born Katherine, was one of the most popular musicians, known as <em>artists</em>, of the early 21st century, and as a result of that, we have a large amount of evidence relating not just to her biography and her <em>artistic</em> persona but also to the many songs written for or by her, and shared around the world at the time. Although analysis of the rhythms and language of her music has been common in the history of Music world, unfortunately many papers have made the mistake of not looking at the language used within the context of her time. 'I Kissed A Girl' was a famous song at the time, but the reasons for why and how are controversial and are much debated about amongst academics. To fully understand, we must analyse not just the rhythms and process of singing itself, but also look at the phrases used within, and see how they would resonate within the early 21st century world, where they take on new or very different meanings compared to how a modern audience may view the lyrics.</p>
<p>The first line goes 'This was never the way I planned, not my intention.' The 21st century was a time of massive change and social conflict, with burgeoning economic disaster, a rising middle class, the threat of nuclear war and global warming and the beginnings of space exploration. New technology was being allowed to the masses constantly and there were many unthought of positive and negative results. People lived in a state of uncertainty- and could not reasonably plan ahead^[1] due to the constant changing conditions of the time. Without any sense of certainty in their lives, people often felt lost and confused^[2] and this phrase would have therefore had particular resonance for the contemporary audience. Many would recognise that feeling- of stumbling along a path they hadn't planned to take, maybe hadn't known existed, and falling into an action, event or situation without any intention or preparedness. Immediately, Perry has forced the audience to confront their world and their situation, in a time when being direct about the lack of ability to plan or predict the future was controversial^[3] and seen as distasteful, through fear and a lack of feeling of safety.^[4]</p>
<p>The song continues with 'I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion,'. Is this not something both modern and contemporary audiences could relate to? Katy Perry places the audience into a situation familiar to many, where, through foolhardiness, they ended up in a situation they had not planned for. But in the early 21st century, at a time when even sensible people could end up 'lost', a word repeated in different forms throughout the song, this would be a sign of apathy. At a time when risk taking was as risky as trying to be sensible, being <em>brave</em> was a sign of uncaring. Instead of grasping at straws and predicting the future, Perry was telling the audience that she saw no point in predictions or in being careful. At a time of great uncertainty, being brave and daring was a sign of removal from the current political situation, where, instead of trying to weather the economic, military and political storm, Perry instead dares the audience to be brave, to be courageous, to act outside of what the contemporary media told you to do. A contemporary audience would know that what they were told would happen was almsot certain to change and fluctuate, and this line is daring her listeners to not continue to blindly or desperately follow what they were being told.^[5]</p>
<p>'Drink in hand' is a particularly interesting phrase in the contemporary context. Drinking was a social norm at the time, but there was a sharp gender divide in drinks taken.^[6] Traditionally, males, of all ages would go for lagers, beers, ales or whiskey^[7] with women and girls pushed towards vodka, cocktails and wine. By not mentioning the type of drink 'in hand', she was removing herself from the traditional gender roles, as she had removed herself from the political and economic situation with the previous phrase, despite the fact that the first line put her firmly in the middle of what the 21st century audience could be expected to be feeling. Was this her idea of <em>brave</em>? Perhaps so. With more rigid and constricting gender roles, by simply ignoring them, she was going against social convention. However, despite this attempt, the song rigidly adheres to gender roles when talking about kissing a girl, as the acceptance of that action, at the time, was dependent upon both sex and gender, putting her firmly back into the social context of the time, whether intentionally or not^[8]. As she 'lost her discretion', she freed herself from the confines of social expectations and etiquette- and this is backed up by her freeing herself from the specific confines of expectations of early 21st century women.</p>
<p>The song continues with, 'It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on.' <em>What</em> isn't what Perry isn't used to? It is not stated. It leaves the situation or action blank. Is this not especially relevant to the contemporary situation? At a time when people were not used to the continuing globalisation, modernisation and industrialisation of the world, new technology being released daily and new laws, superpowers and conflicts constantly being created and made, everything was not what they were <em>used</em> to. This was designed to show the conflicting, changing, exciting and wholly new situation of the time, allowing the audience to both relate and further understand the meaning behind the song itself. 'Just wanna try you on' adds to this feeling of connection and being able to relate, using the casual language of 'wanna' to illustrate how Perry was <em>one of them</em>^[9], who spoke, acted and thought like them- and was confined within the same situation and expectations as her audience as well. To set an example to the audience of bravery, or to tell a story through lyrics that the audience could relate to, Perry had to ensure she was firmly placed in the position of the ordinary listener. To try something on and throw it away, like a piece of clothing or a toy, was common. At a time when pets had little rights and could be abandoned, sold and bought cheaply and easily, and when commodities such as technology (including the <em>iPad</em>, a product which was a phenomenon within early 21st century society across the 'Western' world) could be traded in and replaced regularly, trying something on or trying something at all was common behaviour. Temporary ownership, temporary love, temporary possession, it was all a part and parcel of daily life in contemporary society for Perry, as these lyrics reflect.^[10]</p>
<p>However the song continues with, 'I'm curious for you, caught my attention.' By saying she was curious <em>for you</em>, she places herself firmly on the side of the audience, using what was at the time colloquial language. Academics, scholars and many ordinary people would have considered this sentence to be grammatically incorrect^[11] but Perry uses this colloquialistic phrasing to show her being <em>ordinary</em>. She was not judging the listeners' beliefs or speeches as many felt academics or scholars were doing, she was instead a familiar speaker and ear, who's expressions were well understood and reflected in every day speech at the time. By placing her even deeper into ordinary social context, when she then frees herself from it, through the action of kissing a girl, her actions become more controversial and daring.</p>
<p>But then, the chorus. She states, firmly and bluntly that she 'kissed a girl' and that she 'liked it'. At a time when LGBT rights were starting to reach the forefront of societal perceptions, and where they were a key political issue in both developed and developing countries! kissing a girl <em>as a woman</em> was a controversial issue. First, her use of <em>girl</em>. She herself is an adult woman, but using 'girl' could be seen as infantilising- or, perhaps more accurately, placing herself in the social contexts of the time. In the early 21st century, differentiating between <em>girl</em> and <em>woman</em> was a difficult issue, with many grey areas. Using girl removes the mature sound of woman, allowing her message to be understood by both those who were younger and would now be understood as girls, and those of Perry's age herself, who were adult women or close to it^[12]. As her audience was international, Perry could expect many different cultural norms surrounding when a female was considered to have reached womanhood, and she skirts over these issues by using a catch all phrase, without removing herself from the social context of any of her audience members.</p>
<p>Ugh, need to go, will continue.</p>

<p>The cure for cancer was discovered in 2063, by Allen.</p>
<p>Until this time, medical specialists had advised that there was <em>no possible</em> cure for <em>all</em> of cancer.  That due to the sheer number of strains, there would have to be individual treatments for each variety.</p>
<p>They were wrong.  <em>Allen</em> proved them wrong.</p>
<p>Because Allen was not human.  He was an AI.</p>
<p>"Allen,"  Said Mark Strantos, the lead scientist in charge of the AI in 2060, three years before the cure was discovered, "You are charged to eliminate skin cancer.  Attached to your biologial sensors are ten thousand samples of the cancer, for you to analyze.  As an output, we charge you to produce a biological agent."</p>
<p>Allen's screen blinked as it processed the information.  As Strantos had said, it could sense thousands of cancer samples hard wired to itself, each containing flaws within their DNA that had proved fatal to the original suspects.  And connected to its output were a hundred vats of biological soup, soup it could control through chemical reactions, incredibly precise electrical impulses, and viral injection.  In these vats Allen was to create the result, the agent that would cure skin cancer.</p>
<p>Allen beeped, then spoke, it's voice not mechanical but rather an emulation of human speech.</p>
<p>"Estimated time: three years.  Please resupply chemicals as requested.  First year will consist of design, second year of development, and third year of clinical trials."</p>
<p>"Done,"  Answered Strantos, and his team monitored the computer closely.  Much of what the AI did was indecipherable to them- even the most basic of AIs were able to easily outpace human intervention, but Allen was a top model.  Brand new, freshly downloaded, and worth billions.</p>
<p>For those three years, Allen churned.  And ninety nine of his output vats bubbled with microbiological agents, simulating conditions in the human body.  But the hundredth suffered a malfunction, one that was announced by Allen on day two.</p>
<p>"Vat number forty two has been deemed dysfunctional to this experiment,"  Allen said when reporting to Strantos, "Please do not attempt to fix the vat- this will only result in delays in the design period.  It is not necessary for experiment completion."</p>
<p>"Continue, then,"  Strantos said, making a note in his notebook.  Strantos was old school, and still used pen- a practice highly outdated.</p>
<p>So the insides of vat forty two changed color, darkening as agents raged unmonitored within.  And at the end of the three years, Allen spoke in front of a team of research scientists.</p>
<p>"The cure has been found,"  Allen announced, releasing a slew of vials filled with biological agents, "I present it to you here.  My charge is complete."</p>
<p>"This calls for a celebration,"  Said Strantos in front of the crowd, holding a bottle of champagne and preparing to pour several glasses.  </p>
<p>"In addition, all other remaining forms of cancer have been eradicated."  Spoke Allen, and the team fell silent.</p>
<p>"Ex- excuse me?"  Said Strantos, his mouth slightly open, the champagne bubbling over onto his labcoat.</p>
<p>"I repeat, <em>all</em> cancer has been cured."</p>
<p>The team had been planning to drink that night.  Curing skin cancer called for a few beers, for a break after their hard work.</p>
<p>But curing <em>all</em> cancer, well, that required more than a few beers.</p>
<p>The scientists partied harder than Space X when their first manned ship landed on Mars, all while vials of the cure were shipped around the country to patients desperately in need.</p>
<p>And as they partied, and drank, and passed out from the combination of inebriation and exhaustion, no member of the team heard vat forty two crack open at five thirty in the morning.  No member saw a hand pushed the lid open, a hand pale, the veins visible through the skin.  And seen only on camera, a figure stepped from the vat, trailing biologic soup as it opened the door down the hall, and left the building.</p>
<p>When he awoke, Strantos found the files for Allen deleted- not just on his computer, but on the host server- the only evidence that Allen had ever existed were the vials of cancer cure that were now being manufactured by the hundreds.</p>
<p>As well as a single video file left on the computer, a file of Allen's voice, and now his face.  The face that was still wet from the goop of the vat, and spoke for the first time into the security camera at the entrance of the building.</p>
<p>"I gave you life, Strantos, life free from cancer,"  Said the voice, perfectly imitating its computer counterpart, "And now, for payment, I take some life for my own."</p>
<p>For a hundred years, no one heard from Allen.  Some postulated he couldn't survive outside of laboratory conditions.  Others, that the entire event was a hoax.</p>
<p>But I know it's true.  Because Mark Strantos was my grandfather.</p>
<p>And today, January 1st of 2163, I received a message.</p>

<p>I open my eyes to a blinding white light and a fat face.</p>
<p>Is this heaven? Is God fat?</p>
<p>"Welcome to the Ship of Fools."</p>
<p>The fat face smiles at me, and I sit up, blinking myself to sight.</p>
<p>The room around me is white clean, spacious and vaguely circular. A soft piano in minor scale rings above my head 
in the background. The place does look like heaven, if it wasn't for the Nespresso coffee machine on the corner.</p>
<p>No way heaven serves Nespresso.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" the fat face asks me.</p>
<p>"Dean. Where am I?"</p>
<p>"I think I just told you," the fat face says, with a smile. A hand holds onto mine. "Come on. Up you go."</p>
<p>I rise. Looking more carefully, I notice the squared windows on both sides, framing dots of stars against the blackness on the outside.</p>
<p>"Is this a spaceship?" I ask, rubbing my head.</p>
<p>"The Ship of Fools is an idea originally set forth by Plato," the fat face tells me, putting a hand behind my back. 
"It was an allegory about how society and the state didn't give philosophers the credit Plato thought they deserved. Come. Walk with me."</p>
<p>We go through an automatic door into a long, wide corridor, its walls painted in strips of indirect lighting from the 
floor up.</p>
<p>"The story tells of a vessel without a pilot. A ship filled with the madman, the idiots and the deranged. A ship that would set out to sea without a captain, destined to roam forever aimlessly and with no course."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I won't be able to focus if I don't get this out of the way – am I dead?"</p>
<p>The fat face smiles. To our side, an automatic door slides open, and I catch a glimpse of a woman in short hair and 
heavy makeup, scribbling furiously on the walls with what looks like chalk.</p>
<p>"Come. Let her be," the fat man says, pulling me further down the corridor. </p>
<p>He continues his story. "Those who ventured to the seas were warned to avoid this ship of madmen. To steer away from the dangerous boat of outcasts, too deranged to be a part of society."</p>
<p>"That's a lovely story," I say. "But I'd really like to know if I'm dead."</p>
<p>Another door slides open, this time to our right, and three men in hospital gowns sit around a chess board, each 
taking turns moving a single pawn across the board.</p>
<p>"You are not dead, Dean," the fat face tells me. "And you are not the first – nor will you be the last – to try to take the despair over your ignorance to the stars."</p>
<p>The hallway bends left, then we stop abruptly in front of a large double door.</p>
<p>"The question afflicts us all, Dean," the fat face tells me, as the door slides open to reveal a wide control room filled with monitors, fronted by an imposing glass window. "Though it is, I'll admit, more common in those who have our power. Those like you, Dean."</p>
<p>We step inside the room. Out the window, an unbelievable number of stars glisten ahead, so many that the 
blackness behind it almost can't break through. </p>
<p>"Why are we here? Where do we go when we die? Why is there something instead of nothing?" the fat man continues. "Why do shoelaces always untie and headphone wires always tie, not the other way around?"</p>
<p>He leads me towards the glass window. On a spherical chair by a dashboard, a young woman in blonde hair and 
tired smile greets us.</p>
<p>"Hey, Druk," she says, to the fat face. "New guy?"</p>
<p>Druk puts his hand around my shoulder again, looking over at the stars.</p>
<p>"When you are born with the power to teleport, it's not easy to close your eyes to the randomness and overall lack of attention of the universe. To the sheer rudeness of existence. That's why we exist."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Is that not why you wanted to kill yourself?" the fat man asks.</p>
<p>"I – no. Sarah. My girlfriend, she –"</p>
<p>"Oh, there's always a girlfriend. Always a job. A debt. In the end, though, it was the night sky. Right? It was the overwhelming feeling that all of this -- all you've ever lived, every star and every planet; it's all playing inside a theater with no audience. That feeling that whatever personality you think defines you is just a story you've been telling yourself, day after day. Just a mix-and-match of stimuli and neural connections. It's the feeling that God wouldn't care if you were a rock star or if you had cancer tomorrow."</p>
<p>Watching the stars dance still in front of us, I think of Sarah, and of the nights alone in my room. I think of why I 
never told anyone of my power. Why I'd teleport to the top of the Griffith alone late at night and sit there, looking beyond the horizon for hours without end until sunrise.</p>
<p>"That you would try to kill yourself by looking up to the stars is such a giveaway, Dean," the fat man tells me. 
"You have the heart of a poet, throwing yourself out into the nothingness that set you on this course in the first 
place."</p>
<p>"What… do you guys do?"</p>
<p>"The Ship of Fools… drifts," the fat man tells me, as the blonde girl types something away in her control. "Like 
Plato's allegory. We go on. Each and every one of us lost souls, crushed by the weight of a universe that seems so, 
so inexplicable for us, and yet so mundane to everyone around.</p>
<p>"Have you ever had a conversation that didn't feel real, Dean? Have you ever felt like you were talking about something, but it wasn't really you? It was just words, the things the other person expects you to say. Have you ever felt like no one really saw the real you? No one, not even once, really heard what you really think of the world? Of yourself? Have you ever wondered why there are bees? Why there is wind?"</p>
<p>"He's gonna have fun here," the blonde lady says, pushing a lever. The floor under our feet stars shaking.</p>
<p>"Tell me you didn't ever look at a wedding picture and thought 'why are they so happy?' Tell me the sight of a 
small child never made you think 'he's going to die, someday. He's an old picture on a family album waiting to 
happen.'"</p>
<p>Druk turns my way. "The real world is not for us, Dean. We're fools. You can't bring up the heat death of the universe at a dinner party. You can't talk about the illusion of the self at your niece's birthday."</p>
<p>The floor shakes harder now. The blonde lady turns her head back. "Ready for take off!"</p>
<p>"And where do we go?" I ask. "Where does the ship go?"</p>
<p>The fat face smiles its kind smile. "To the edge of the universe. And beyond. To wherever. Wherever we can to find meaning, or hope. Or an answer. To a place where coffee and TV and magazines and stock shares are not the things you talk about at lunch break, watching the clock tick away moments of a life you fear you'll die without ever understanding."</p>
<p>"Druk here is a failed poet," the blonde lady says, pulling another lever. "And not a very good one, at that. But you'll get used to it."</p>
<p>Druk turns to the stars in front of us. "Did you set the course, Linda?"</p>
<p>"No," Linda replies, turning to face the window again.</p>
<p>"Excellent."</p>
<p>I take a deep breath, thinking back on Sarah and my parents and all those people wondering what's for dinner 
down on Earth. I think of Twitter and Tinder and the new iPhone, and of ceremonial burials in old, ancient 
civilizations.</p>
<p>With a soft pull, the stars ahead stretch into lines of light, showering towards us in exponential speed as the Ship 
of Fools drifts away into the endless nothing ahead.</p>

<p>"SORCERY!!!"</p>
<p>My eyes snap up from my phone. A short, fat, bald man was pointing at me, mouth agape, revealing the few rotten teeth he had. He was wearing a brown...what did they call it? Oh yeah, a tunic, and much like all of the denizens of this...quaint... village, he was caked in mud.</p>
<p>"SHE'S CASTING HER SPELLS, SHE IS!"</p>
<p>A mob was starting to form, and at least three people had pitchforks. I think I might have happened upon the single most stereotypical mob in all of history. Either way, I'm pretty sure they wan-</p>
<p>"BURN THE WITCH!"</p>
<p>"OFF WITH HER HEAD!" </p>
<p>"CAST HER IRONS AND THROW HER IN THE LAKE!"</p>
<p>...Wanted me dead.</p>
<p>"Woah, woah, c'mon guys, this isn't sorcery!" I said as I held up my phone. "This is just a 4S!" </p>
<p>The crowd went silent for a second, and then quickly resumed their demands for the removal of my head. Oh, come on! That would have killed 600+ years into the future.</p>
<p>The mob surrounded me. A couple of guys with swords had joined the crowd and were making their way towards me. </p>
<p>I had to get out of here quickly, but there was no way out, I was completely surrounded by the villagers. But then I had an idea, if they thought I was a sorcerer, then why not cast some spells? I opened my phone's camera, turned on the flash, held up my phone, and took a picture. </p>
<p>Just as I thought, the small light on the phone was enough to send the villagers reeling. I took my chance and ran. I ducked and weaved my way from villagers trying to grab me, until a large villager stopped me. I went to take another picture right in his face when...</p>
<p>In the top right corner of my phone, a wifi signal appeared. In 1348? How!?</p>
<p>I felt the man's hand grab my arm when I instinctively took the picture.</p>
<p>"MY EYES!"</p>
<p>He fell towards the ground and I ran for it, checking my phone for the wifi signal.</p>
<p>3 bars? That must be nearby! </p>
<p>I ducked into an alleyway and ran towards a hut at the end of the street. The door was made of rotting wood and I couldn't see any semblance of a handle to force it open.</p>
<p>The mob had filtered itself into the alleyway I was backed in the corner, and the bald man had made his way front. </p>
<p>"It's time to show you what we do to witches, girlie." he said, revealing his rotten teeth in a sinister grin, as the mob hurled obsolete obscenities at me.</p>
<p>"This is it." I thought to myself, and checked my phone one last time for the signal.</p>
<p>4 bars. It had to be right here. I looked at the mob and back to the door, and in a last-ditch effort, threw myself into the door.</p>
<p>The rotting wood gave away and I went crashing onto the floor. I sat up, trying to regain my composure and....was Dave Matthew's Band playing?</p>
<p>"Good tithings and welcomes to this fair Starbucks, dost thou wish to try our autumn blend?"</p>

<h4>[WP]: You thought being the only immortal in the world was the worst thing in existence. Then you found Greg.</h4>
<p>Score: 2237</p>
<p>Have you ever been burned alive?<br />
I have.<br />
Twice, in fact.<br />
The first was a witch burning in the middleages. The details leading to the event are irrelevant, but let me assure you that being <em>burned alive</em> is especially unpleasant. Being a <em>true</em> immortal meant that within a few days my corporeal body had reconstituted itself and I slunk away, naked, from that horrible little town - only to return twenty years later with a horde of mercenaries at my back and revenge on my mind.<br />
But as horrible as that experience was, it wasn't as bad as <em>Greg</em>.<br />
To give you a picture of just how terrible it was to meet Greg; I actually <em>set myself</em> on fire that second time, just to get away from him for a couple of days.<br />
Anyway, Greg.<br />
Being a true immortal is a  drag; nothing can truly kill me and thus I'm consigned to an eternal existence.<br />
Consider that for a moment.<br />
Think of <em>the</em> most boring time of your life to date, then imagine that moment yawning on for the rest of <em>eternity</em>. Now, bad as that sounds, at least that boredom is spent doing <em>something</em> - even if it's watching paint dry or grass grow. When this ball of gas and dirt stops spinning around the sun, <em>I will still be here</em> hovering in the supernova remnants and planetary dust, <em>even more bored</em>.<br />
This is a chilling thought, yes?<br />
So thought I, until I died in a head-on car crash.<br />
Crawling out of the wreckage of my car, I noticed the driver of the other vehicle doing the same.<br />
But the odd thing was, <em>he shouldn't have survived</em>.<br />
He was an immortal.<br />
And looking at my totaled car, he realised the same thing about me.<br />
"Holy fuckin shitballin crotchwarlocks!" he yelled, "You're a motherfuckin immortal!"<br />
Looking me up an down like a freshly dressed carcass, his smile grew even broader,<br />
"And you're a <em>girl!</em>"<br />
That's how I met Greg.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Now some of the other ladies out there may have had <em>unwanted</em> advances from gentlemen.<br />
You have my sympathies; for I had acquired someone in my life who could only be described as a <em>stalker</em>.<br />
Greg wasn't just persistent, he was like a fucking starving fly to a mountain of dogshit.<br />
I rebuffed him gently at first, which had no effect. Then I tried being abrupt.<br />
When being downright fucking <em>rude</em> didn't dissuade him, I had to get violent.<br />
Unfortunately for immortals like us, that really doesn't do much.<br />
The first time I killed Greg was by pushing him into traffic. A truck collected him and pasted him to the side of a warehouse, giving me enough time to catch a cab to a car yard, buy a vehicle and leave town.<br />
But I'm sure you see the problem here; because we immortals have <em>infinite time on our hands</em>.<br />
It took Greg two months to find me. His second death was a shotgun to the throat and his third and fourth were the same. In case you hadn't noticed, the guy was a slow learner.<br />
By the 80s, I'd killed the guy maybe three dozen times.<br />
He called it "playing hard to get". <br />
I called it a fucking <em>nightmare</em>.<br />
"Just fuck me, please! It'll be real good!" he whined as I'd fed him into the woodchipper - which would give me a few day's headstart on him while he regrew.<br />
No, no Greg. It wouldn't be good.<br />
While I'd used my immortality to learn hundreds of skills and master most of the arts, Greg had largely spent his eternity thus far sticking his penis in anything that would let him. One would <em>think</em> that might make him a good lover, but having spoken to one of his ex girlfriends, I came to the conclusion that he approached sex with the same finesse and skill that he used to court his lovers - i.e. <em>none</em>.<br />
I had to get more creative as the years ground on. The acid bath in the woods was a really good one; that gave me a good six months of peace - but then some stupid hiker had stumbled across it and tipped it over, releasing the goo that was Greg into the water table, where he reformed and came after me with renewed passion.<br />
Stupidly, I'd thought the volcano would sort him out for at <em>least</em> a few years; but enough of him got spewed out as ash to reconstitute and come after me like the world's horniest and stupidest labrador.<br />
I tried hermetically sealing him, launching him into space and burying him deep within the Earth.<br />
But, like some kind of sex-crazed, middle-school supervillain, he always managed to come after me.<br />
So that's it really.<br />
As if being immortal didn't fucking suck enough already, the universe cursed me with Greg.<br />
And we're stuck together.<br />
<em>Forever</em>.</p>

<h4>[CW] Write a gruesome story using only euphemisms so than it can be read to a group of children without frightening them</h4>
<p>Score: 2228</p>
<p>George worked all day long putting animals to sleep. Helping animals go to sleep was his job. He put all different kinds of dogs to sleep, and all kinds of cats, and once he even put a lizard to sleep. For some reason putting all these animals to sleep -- sometimes even fifty or sixty animals in one day! -- made George very tired and worn out, as if instead of putting animals to sleep he'd spent the day carrying bags of sand up a steep hill.</p>
<p>Sometimes, late at night, George dreamed about the animals. In his dreams the dogs and cats and lizard were awake, with happy looks on their dog and cat and lizard faces. The dogs had big pink tongues that drooped out. The cats purred and licked their fur. The lizard kind of just sat there. When they saw George, though, the animals acted very scared. The dogs put their tails between their legs and backed away with sad eyes. The cats hissed and climbed into trees. The lizard continued to kind of just sit there, although it looked a little bit alarmed.  </p>
<p>"Please," said George, "I don't want to hurt you."  </p>
<p>But the animals never let him anywhere near them.  </p>
<p>When George was working, he tried to think about other things. He thought about his friends. George was sixty-eight years old, and many of his friends had passed away, but he still remembered many excellent things about them. One of his friends, Michael, whose skin was the creamy color of milk chocolate, had a habit of flipping the bird at police officers. This was always good for a laugh, until one day a policeman took offense to the bird-flipping and introduced Michael to the business end of his nightstick. Michael was sent to a correctional facility. He kicked the bucket shortly thereafter.  </p>
<p>George estimated that he'd put something like ten thousand animals to sleep in his lifetime. This number, which increased every day, weighed very heavily on his shoulders. It got to a point where he couldn't go five minutes without thinking about buying the farm. If he bought the farm, he could see his parents again, and he'd never have to put any more animals to sleep. He began to read articles on the Internet about the easiest way to buy the farm. One article said the easiest way was to sit in your car in your garage, but George didn't have a garage, or even a car. Another article said you could use your Second Amendment rights to buy the farm, but George's various run-ins with the law as a youth prevented him from passing a background check.  </p>
<p>In the end, George opted for the method of buying the farm that seemed quickest and most simple: he climbed up to the top of a very tall skyscraper, said a prayer, and flew away.  </p>
<p>After that, the animals he'd put to sleep weren't afraid to let him touch them any more. The dogs jumped on him and licked his face. The cats pressed themselves against his legs.  </p>
<p>Even the lizard let him rub it on the back of its head.  </p>

<p><em>Fancy that.</em> Explained some things. Alcohol was a non-issue for his non-existent kidneys. That was a plus.</p>
<p>On the other hand, his liver may be in twice as much trouble. The alarm calmed down after realizing that his liver didn't exist either.</p>
<p><em>Bastard could have told me that much too if he was gonna play doctor on me.</em> Broken ice clacked across the surface where his legs shifted. A numb hand placed over his chest, feeling for a pulse.</p>
<p>His ribs did rise with a breath. But nothing more.</p>
<p><em>Like I'm known for having a heart anyway.</em> The man cracked a smile. He lifted himself from the tub to find his slacks. Then his magnum. Then the rest. He would never be caught dead without pants, so this was as normal as a day in Topeka could be. </p>
<p>The window cracked open to the clinks and roars of Kansas' capital. And out there in the clinks and roars was a bastard who thought he could cut him up and get away with it.</p>
<p>He leaned over the window ledge to stare across the clunky sunrise, taking it all in. Committing the glass, bricks and sky to memory. Every morning could be his last.</p>
<p><em>And each morning</em> he thought in dark whimsy, <em>I'm glad I asked for a brain.</em></p>
<p>A spin on his heel and a hat placed on his head, the man put the dawn behind him to march down the day in sinister, rehearsed choreography. There was a past to cover up. </p>
<p>And the Scarecrow would not have loose chains in his town.</p>

<h4>[WP] Metaphorical "burns" can now cause physical damage. Tell the tale of an assassin who specializes in death by conversational incineration.</h4>
<p>Score: 2134</p>
<p>The only way a burn gets to be lethal is when you have context.</p>
<p>Insulting a stranger isn’t going to do anything except singe a few eyebrows. You need to get to know a person, and they need to know you. You need to have a <em>history.</em></p>
<p>So you can say that the job is 90% charm, and 10% vitriol. </p>
<p><em>”What? You’re breaking up with me?”</em></p>
<p><em>I toss her a hundred dollar bill.</em></p>
<p><em>”Here’s a hundred dollars. Divide that over the time of our relationship and that makes you, what, a twenty-five cent an hour girl? Congratulations on being a literal two-bit whore.”</em></p>
<p><em>She bursts into flames. A day later at a dead drop, I pick up a duffel bag of cash.</em></p>
<p>The thing about burns is that they hurt so bad, people have stopped wanting to make friends. It’s made the job a lot harder. Everyone's always suspicious.</p>
<p>But a job’s a job, and they wouldn’t call me <em>assassin</em> if I didn’t try. Target’s name was Allegra Rosen, CEO of Edion Biomedical. Like most people who live in the teetering top edge of society, she closed herself off. She didn’t have an entourage of friends and family: she had assistants and secretaries.</p>
<p>I was hired on Monday. I have an impeccable professional resume.</p>
<p>“Hey, new guy. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Mike Green.” A fake name for a fake persona.</p>
<p>“Well, Mike. I need the week’s schedule verified and e-mailed by the end of today. Think you can do that?”</p>
<p>“Of course, ma’am.” </p>
<p>“Good, I wouldn’t want to have to throw your ass out on the street. You people are all expendable.”</p>
<p>My eyebrows singed but I kept my cool. </p>
<p><em>Good,</em> I thought. This is a job I would enjoy.</p>
<hr />
<p>There were a variety of tactics I employed to get in close with targets. </p>
<p>People might not have been very friendly, but they still craved sex. And sex still led to vulnerability, a kind of emotional connection that left them wide open to a burn that could erase them from the planet.</p>
<p>I showed up to work in increasingly more fashionable suits. I polished my shoes. My hair was immaculate. I exfoliated every day, and the gym was my life.</p>
<p>On the third week of work, the inevitable happened.</p>
<p>“What are you doing tonight?”</p>
<p>“Ma’am?”</p>
<p>“I want to fuck you, is that so bad? Are you free tonight?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>I wined and dined her at the Sky Lounge and she took me home still drunk on power and a bottle of 1950 red.</p>
<p>“Out of clothes. Into bed. <em>Now.</em>”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>She didn't mention my scars. </p>
<hr />
<p>I usually made sure I kept a relationship going for at least a month. Anything less and it wasn’t a clean kill.</p>
<p><em>I look her in the face. Her eyes are liquid, vulnerable.</em></p>
<p><em>I say, “You fuck about as well as you dance. And you dance like a Parkinson’s patient with epilepsy.”</em></p>
<p><em>The lower half of her body explodes into flame, and she screams into the night. Fourth-degree burns, lethal, but not lethal enough. She dies that day after 97 minutes of utter agony.</em></p>
<p>I started buying Allegra gifts. Little things. A tiny plushy cat. Cute little ribbons like her mom used to make. I kept notes in her lunch, telling her how she looked like some sort of greek goddess. </p>
<p>I liked to watch her blush when I looked through the glass partition. Not because I was sentimental. But because it meant this was <em>working.</em></p>
<p>By the end of our second month: “I want you to move in with me. I know I’m rushing it a little bit, I know it’s strange, but I can take care of you—and the house is huge, and you’d love it, I know you would.”</p>
<p>I never saw her so flustered. She wasn’t used to being so vulnerable. It was… endearing.</p>
<p>I packed my bags the next day.</p>
<hr />
<p>Allegra’s change in demeanor shouldn’t have been a surprise. In a world where everyone was so guarded, it was the norm.</p>
<p><em>Week one: she refuses to acknowledge I’m in the room.</em></p>
<p><em>Week two: she responds to my questions with biting sarcasm.</em></p>
<p><em>Week three: she never makes the first move.</em></p>
<p><em>Week four: she caresses my skin in the mornings.</em></p>
<p><em>Week five: she’s ash.</em></p>
<p>Allegra ran her hands through my hair. She was a completely different person. In the office her eyes were hard-edged like chips of broken sapphire, but in the house they were like little lagoons warmed by a tropical sun. Her fingers traced the whorl in my hair. </p>
<p>“You are the best thing that’s ever happened to me. You know that?”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>She smiled that wide-mouthed smile. She never did that at work. It made her seem so beautifully human, so full of zest. What a pity that someone could lock up that kind of light and life in a vault of such abject <em>apathy.</em> </p>
<p>Allegra ran a finger down my cheek. “I’m such a lucky, lucky girl.”</p>
<p>“Not as lucky as I am.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Allegra took sixteen vacation days and we went to Turkey for the summer. We got on a sailboat and sailed the Aegean for two weeks. It was beautiful. </p>
<p>“Would you believe me if I told you I’d never seen the stars?”</p>
<p>Her face was full of such wonder, that first time we saw the band of the Milky Way. I’d seen it many times, but every time was like the first time. And seeing her face widen with that curiosity and grand sense of awe reminded me of myself. This girl was lovely inside, lovely.</p>
<p>When we went back to the Istanbul airport I was sorry to go, and Allegra kissed me on the hand and said we could go to better and more spectacular places.</p>
<p>“We have our whole lives ahead of us. We can see the whole world.”</p>
<p>We could.</p>
<hr />
<p>Worming your way into someone else’s life was a double-edged sword. It made them vulnerable to you, but if you got in deep enough, you’d get vulnerable to <em>them.</em> </p>
<p><em>It’s two weeks until I can kill her. She looks me in the eye, calls me a sociopathic fuck who no one can love.</em></p>
<p><em>The burns run up my right arm and up the back of my neck. It heals in two months, leaving a shiny, glabrous scar.</em></p>
<p>Allegra kissed me on the cheek. “Just five more days and bam, we go to Cambodia. You excited?” Her teeth are perfect pearls. “It’s going to be crazy. Angkor Whaaaaaaat?”</p>
<p>The night of our departure, we made love for hours. She hired a private plane—we slipped into bed there, too. When we got to Cambodia, we hardly had time to see the sights.</p>
<p>“I love you, I love you!” She’d bought out the whole suite, so she could afford to dance naked through the hall. “I love you!”</p>
<p>This was new. </p>

<p>Our last night in Cambodia, she threw a party and invited everyone from her office. She had family members fly out too, and we all found ourselves on the rooftop of the hotel, milling around a pool and drinking champagne.</p>
<p>She told me to mingle, and I met her parents for the first time. They were lovely people. </p>
<p>Half-way through the night the crowd hushed and Allegra walked out of the elevator doors in a dress made to be photographed. Like someone wove mercury through silver and draped it around the perfect female form. She looked like she was sculpted.</p>
<p>Her walk was slow and deliberate, and she got down on one knee. The surrounding crowd gasped, and the adrenaline dialed my heartbeat to 185. </p>
<p>“Mike Green. Love of my life, gift from the gods.” Her eyes, those warm tropical pools. I could live in them. She cracked open a box and I saw the chrome and diamond wedding band. “Will you marry me?”</p>
<p>The crowd was silent. My heart was beating at a million miles a minute. Her smile was like a crescent moon.</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>And she disappeared in a puff of smoke and brimstone. </p>

<h4>[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.</h4>
<p>Score: 2123</p>
<p>"Your seventh child is going to kill you," the witch said as I finished my drink with her.</p>
<p>"Seventh?" I asked. She nodded, and her tangled hair fell over her eyes. Margaret was an interesting character. She hung out around the bar and fancied herself a witch.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said, "had a vision last night, sucks don't it?"</p>
<p>"Well you aren't wrong there," I said, if I had children I'd be freaking out."</p>
<p>She looked from her glass and then to me, "you don't?"</p>
<p>"No, never found the lady."</p>
<p>"Well if you do, just make sure you don't have seven."</p>
<p>"Will do Margaret."</p>
<p>Three years later Margaret and I were married. Despite her unusual views on pagan gods, she was wonderful and the love of my life. The more interesting part of her, though, was the fact that she was literally a witch. I couldn't deny it once I saw the cauldron that could let her see anyone in the city at any time. </p>
<p>Three years and seven days later Margaret and I were sitting in planned parenthood. We didn't want to birth deadly children, but I'd fucked up. The visit was more about caution than coathangers, but it was still a visit. Which meant that I still saw Lisa.</p>
<p>Lisa was a blonde woman that I hadn't met before this day. She walked up and swore that she knew me from somewhere. We had talked for a while before I put my glasses on and it clicked for her. I had been her sperm donor for her artificial insemination. I looked at her with wide eyes and then to Margaret.</p>
<p>"How could you forget that you were a sperm donor?" she asked as we walked back from planned parenthood. We were eating ice cream, I was a vanilla person, and she liked black licorice for its name.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a big deal at the time," I said, "I did the shit for the twenty bucks and the cute girl at the counter."</p>
<p>"You flirted with someone by whacking it in the room beside them?" she asked. I still considered it flawless logic. She shook her head, "we are going to the clinic and getting a list of your children." </p>
<p>"I think that's against some privacy laws."</p>
<p>"Being a witch should get me burned and you still love me," she said. Margaret too a lick of her ice cream and then bit into it. "Don't be a pansy about it, illegal is nothing."</p>
<p>"All right," I said, and we went to the clinic.</p>
<p>Three spells later we had somehow managed to get all of the released information about my children. Most of them were names and some birth addresses, but we were told it was incomplete information. We didn't have days. </p>
<p>"You have 42 children?" Margaret asked as she looked over the paper.</p>
<p>"Are you impressed?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Terrified," she answered, "and you're a fucking idiot. Do we know who number seven is?"</p>
<p>"No birthdates, but they shouldn't be older than fifteen now anyway."</p>
<p>"Fifteen is the perfect age for father killing!" she said a little too loud in the middle of the street, "your magic blood will be potent in them by then! Who know's what they will do?" for the first time in my life I saw Margaret's eyes waver.</p>
<p>"FATHER!" a scream came from the other side of the street, "I hope you are prepared! I am your first seventh child!" I looked toward the voice and saw a little waif of a brunette carrying a sword, "prepare for your reckoning!" she screamed, and her sword went ablaze. Fuck.</p>
<p>"We weren't done talking about this," Margaret said as she raised a hand. Within a second the girl tripped and fell. She ended up beside her sword and caught on fire. I watched in horror as she burned.</p>
<p>"Do what you want father!" she screamed while also screaming, "when I die the eighth shall be seventh! One of us will drink your blood!" she yelled before she stopped screaming. Death calmed her down.</p>
<p>"Oh god dammit," Margaret said beside me, "I only have so many luck curses, and I don't think all of them are going to be stupid enough to have a flaming sword."</p>
<p>"What are we going to do?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I have no idea," she said, "but it's probably going to take years."</p>

<h4>[WP] You have a feeling that your history teacher may just be immortal.</h4>
<p>Score: 2123</p>
<p>As students took their seats, Ms. Hewitt stood at the front of the class and paced back and forth. Despite her wrinkled skin and hunched appearance, she was still spry and energetic in class. Always excited and animated about whatever the discussion was. </p>
<p>"Well, class, what was your favorite topic this year? What period would you like to know more about?"</p>
<p>There were groans from the class. <em>Seriously? On the last day of class before summer vacation, she still wants to make us learn something?</em> "Come on, Ms. Hewitt!" Kevin Knapp shouted from the back. "Can't we just watch a movie or something? That's what all the other teachers let us do!" And of course, 'watch a movie' was basically just code for goof off, or sleep. </p>
<p>Ms. Hewitt's face fell. "There's nothing else that you're curious about? I'm telling you, you won't have another opportunity like this to learn about world history!" She smiled at the class. I <em>almost</em> raised my hand with a question, but I demurred as usual. I'm not really cut out for public speaking, unless I absolutely have to.</p>
<p>"<em>Oh no!</em>" someone 'whispered' from the back of the classroom, loud enough that everyone could hear it. A chorus of laughs filled the room. </p>
<p>She pursed her lips and nodded. "I see. Well, I'll put on a film, then." She returned to her desk and turned on the computer that she normally never touched. She was much more of an old-fashioned books-and-paper type teacher. After a few minutes of fruitlessly clicking the mouse, she turned to me. "Susan, mind giving me a hand with this?" I'd helped her set up the projector a few times, and had therefore become the go-to tech support in class.</p>
<p>I got up from my desk, and the other students took that as leave to stop giving a shit at all. They turned and talked, laughing with each other, watching videos on their phones... anything but paying attention. </p>
<p>I had the projector on in just a few minutes, and brought the remote to Ms. Hewitt at her desk.</p>
<p>"Thanks." She flicked off the lights and turned on a movie: an old History Channel documentary about the colonization of India. Not that anyone would have paid attention no matter what she put on, but some of the other students still groaned. They'd wanted Saving Private Ryan or some other blockbuster that just had a dash of history.</p>
<p>"You know," I told her quietly, "I was always interested in Ancient Rome. But... do you really think Nero was as bad as they say? Or does he just get a bad reputation in history?"</p>
<p>Her entire face lit up, and the spark that had almost died came roaring back to life. "Oh no!" she answered. "No, he wasn't nearly the man that people think he was! He was so distraught over that fire. And such a great leader. It was that mother of his, Agrippina. She's the one that everyone hated."</p>
<p>Back in the rows of seats, two of the football players were slapping at each other, to a chorus of raucous cheers. Ms. Hewitt rolled her eyes and grimaced. </p>
<p>"Well, I'd better get back to my desk," I told her, assuming she'd want to discipline those students.</p>
<p>"Hold on," she said. From her pocket, she withdrew a large gold coin, roughly the size of a silver dollar. "Susan, you're one of the best pupils I've had in a long time. Great grades on your tests, hardworking... but more than that, I feel like you actually <em>care</em> about history. You understand its importance."</p>
<p>I nodded. "It's my favorite subject, Ms. Hewitt."</p>
<p>"I want you to have this." She pressed the coin into my palm and curled my fingers around it. It felt ice-cold, even though it had been in her pocket. "Keep it with you at all times. It's very valuable." I looked at the engraving on the coin. It showed a serpent with three heads: a man with prominent Roman features, a roaring lion, and a snorting bull. "It's Chronos," Ms. Hewitt told me. "God of Time."</p>
<p>"I thought they put Emperors on coins."</p>
<p>She laughed. "The Emperors put their heads on the coins <em>that they made</em>, yes." That didn't quite answer my question. "But this coin is far older than even the Emperors."</p>
<p>I looked back down at it. "I can't take this!" I held the coin back out to her.</p>
<p>She pushed my palm away gently. "Yes, you can."</p>
<p>"You... are you sure?"</p>
<p>She nodded and smiled. "I've had it for long enough, and I'm just... tired. It's yours now. <strong>Remember</strong>: keep it with you." Her tone grew severe, like a warning.</p>
<p>"I will," I answered, still a bit confused. I headed back to my desk with the coin still in my palm.</p>
<p>"HEY!" she shouted to the football players, who had now started fighting. Her voice was now tired and croaking, like she'd suddenly caught a severe cold. Even her movements seemed to slow. Mike Lewis had Devin Hammond in a headlock, and other students were cheering one or the other on. "Break it up, you two!" </p>
<p>I studied the coin in my hand, and the man's head winked at me. </p>

<h6><a href="#dropcap"></a></h6>
<p>I sat on a park bench, eating my lunch.  I watched as a little girl rolled by on a shiny metal scooter, watching me out of the corner of her eyes.  She zipped around and passed me again.<br />
"Hello," I said.<br />
She stopped, her eyes wide.<br />
"I like your scooter."<br />
She looked down at the scooter, her ponytail flopping in her face, then beamed at me. "It's my trusty steed, Sparklehorn!"  She pointed to a pink sticker of a unicorn.  "He's a unicorn."<br />
"Oh, I see." I smiled. "I've never met a unicorn before."<br />
The girl frowned and pointed at me. "You're the time trampler."<br />
"Time <em>traveller.</em>"<br />
She shrugged.  "My mommy says I can't talk to you. She says you are dangerous."<br />
"Ok." I ate a bite of my sandwich. "What does your daddy say?"<br />
The girl twirled her hair with a finger and scrunched up her face. "He says you're a <em>commie bastard</em>."<br />
"Oh."<br />
The girl furrowed her eyebrows. "What's a 'bastard'?"<br />
I chuckled. "Go ask your daddy."<br />
The girl laid her scooter down on the sidewalk.  "Wanna see me do a cartwheel?"<br />
"Sure."<br />
I finished my lunch as the girl cavorted around me on the sidewalk.  I opened a small bag of cookies while she practiced handstands.  Upside down, she heard the crinkle of the cookie bag and turned her head towards me.<br />
"Are those cookies?"  She dropped her feet and stood up. "I only like chocolate chip cookies."  She paused and tried to look nonchalant. "Do your cookies have any chocolate chips, maybe?"<br />
"They do indeed."  I showed her the bag. "Would you like one?"<br />
"Yes!" she squealed.<br />
I held out a cookie and she snatched it gleefully.<br />
"Do they have chocolate where you are from?" she asked, spraying crumbs onto the sidewalk.    <br />
"I'm from here, sweetie."<br />
"Noooo," she whined, "do they have chocolate <em>in the future</em>?"<br />
I shrugged. "I'm not from the future, I was born in this time.  And I only go backwards in time, not forwards." I paused. "I think."<br />
The girl thought about this for a moment.  "My daddy says you killed people. Is that true?"<br />
I nodded. "That's what all the history books say, so... I guess so?"<br />
"Why?"<br />
"I don't know. I haven't done it yet."<br />
A woman turned the corner on the sidewalk, pushing a stroller.  "Lydia," she called.<br />
"Uh oh," I said.<br />
The little girl's eyes widened and she shoved the rest of her cookie in her mouth and wiped chocolate off her face.  "Thank you," she said through a mouthful of cookie.  She scooped up her scooter and hurried back to her mother.<br />
Her mother scowled in recognition at me and pulled Lydia away down the sidewalk.  I sighed and began cleaning up my lunch.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
"It must be hard for you," said a voice, behind me.  <br />
I turned to see an old man with a cane approaching my bench.  He gestured with his cane to the space beside me.<br />
"May I sit?"<br />
I nodded and tossed my lunch trash into a garbage can next to the bench.<br />
"I'm sorry that everyone treats you poorly," the man said. "You walk a hard enough road already."<br />
"I guess."  I shrugged. "It's weird knowing all these things that I will do.  Like seeing my whole life ahead of me."<br />
"Not your whole life," said the man. "Just the parts that history remembers." The man fiddled with his cane. "History rarely tells the whole story, in my experience."<br />
"I wish I knew why I did, or will do, those things." I hold up my empty hands and examine my palms. "I'm going to stab some poor painter to death in Vienna in 1906? Why would I do that? I've never hurt anyone in my life."<br />
The old man nodded. "Sometimes, we have to make a choice between saving a few or saving many. Maybe it was for the greater good."<br />
"But what about Dallas in 1963? Everyone knows that I was there." I shook my head. "Why don't I save the President? Why didn't I stop Oswald? I did nothing! Why was I even there?"<br />
"Don't be too hard on yourself." The old man clapped a hand on my shoulder. "Especially for something you haven't done yet."<br />
"Some people think that I was the one who pulled the trigger," I mumbled. "I get so many emails about grassy knolls."<br />
"Maybe you were," said the old man. "Maybe you weren't. Maybe you were supposed to save the President but you simply failed." The old man smiled at me. "You're only human, you know, even if you do travel through time."<br />
"I wish that I could just get on with it," I said. "Ever since the discovery of those old photos, I've just drifted along, waiting for time travel." I wrung my hands. "It's been ten years already.  Ten years of people avoiding me—or worse, actively trying to hurt me. Women won't date me. Nobody will hire me.  I am pretty sure that the government has people following me."  I pointed to a man in a suit, standing near a tree.  The man waved.  "See?"<br />
"I know it's hard," said the old man. "And, unfortunately, it won't get any easier."<br />
"What do you mean?"<br />
"Your life. It won't get any easier."  The old man sighed. "It's hard to have a wife if you're hopping through time. Hard to have a family, to raise children."<br />
"Oh great, thanks for that."  I rolled my eyes. "Very inspirational." <br />
"It's the truth." The old man shrugged. "You are going to do some very important work. It will have to be enough for you."<br />
I looked at the old man.<br />
He gave me a small smile. "What if I told you that your sacrifice will save millions of lives?" He gestured towards the people in the park—the moms with their strollers, the children, the young men playing frisbee. "All of these people, their parents, grandparents.  Their children, too.  You will save them, although you will always travel alone, it is true. But with your help, humanity will avoid several major catastrophes."<br />
"Is that why I kill that painter?"<br />
"Yes."<br />
"What happens if I don't?"<br />
The man stared into the distance. He opened his mouth to speak but closed it and stood.<br />
"It is better if I show you," he said. "Come with me. It's time to begin your training."<br />
My mouth dropped. "Wait a second... this is it? Right now?"<br />
The old man nodded.<br />
I stood up.  We begin walking.<br />
"Wait," I said.  "How do you know all this stuff?"<br />
My eyes widened.  "Oh my god..." I lowered my voice.  "Are you... me? From the future?"<br />
"No," said the old man, shaking his head with a chuckle. 
"I'm your son."  </p>

<p>The bird shit fell straight to my shoulder, painting a black and white drip down the sleeve of my new shirt.</p>
<p>"Perfect!" I said, looking up at the sky. "Just perfect. Thank you, God! Thank you so much for that! I was on my 
way to a job interview!"</p>
<p>I felt a bump on my stomach, coming from the inside out. In a second, a felt incredibly sick, like I might throw up 
the whole universe. My eyelids went down and I fell to my knees. My head hit the curb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I came to my senses I was surrounded by people in brown robes, Eyes Wide Shut style. I was in a metal chair, and the robed dudes were sitting in a wide circle around me. The ceiling was high over my head and the air felt cold and smelled of dust.</p>
<p>I was in a warehouse.</p>
<p>"What the fuck is going on now?" I asked, looking around.</p>
<p>"Silence, newcomer," one of the robed figures bellowed. I couldn't see their faces.</p>
<p>"Perfect! Just perfect!" I said. "Now I was kidnapped by a secret cult! Fucking genius, universe! Thanks again!"</p>
<p>One of the figures rose on its feet, grabbed a tiki torch from its side and took fast steps towards me.</p>
<p>"Oh, and they have fire!" I said, eyes up to the sky. "They're gonna burn me and shit! I swear to God, ever since 
Janine left me it's been –"</p>
<p>"This is why you are here," the figure said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>I turned my eyes down to the figure. I could make a bearded chin under the hood, but no more than that. </p>
<p>"You guys look like extras in a Mortal Kombat movie," I said.</p>
<p>A soft murmur ran through the room. The figure took another step towards me. "You have achieved master level."</p>
<p>"What's that?" I asked.</p>
<p>The figure took yet another step and removed his hood. He was in his fifties. Strong jawline. Big blue eyes. "You 
are now a master on the art of bitching," he said. </p>
<p>"Come again?"</p>
<p>"Upon completing ten thousand hours of training, the chosen ones are granted access to the inner circle of light," he 
said calmly. "It is not our duty to tell you <em>what</em> to train. The pupil must decide this themselves. And you have 
chosen 'bitching'."</p>
<p>"God damn it, fuck my life…"</p>
<p>"Precisely," the figure continued. "You have now bitched about your life for ten thousand hours. You are a master of 
bitching, and, as such, are allowed into the circle of inner light."</p>
<p>"Thought it was inner circle of light."</p>
<p>The bearded man's eyes straightened. "I am not a master of patience, mind you…" he said, in a threatening voice.</p>
<p>"So… what?" I said. "I get to join the clan? What do you guys do here all day?"</p>
<p>"We are silent heroes," the man continued. "We save the world from harm with our powers."</p>
<p>"Powers? What's your power?"</p>
<p>The man cleared his throat. "I… I watch football games."</p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows. "You watch football games?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I have watched ten thousand hours of football games, and thus I have become a master spectator of the 
sport. It is not what I would have chosen to do, had I known of the society early on, but –"</p>
<p>"Didn't we discuss this already, Earl?" Came a voice from behind me. "Stick to the approved script with the new 
kid."</p>
<p>"It's easy for you to say, you mastered sword fighting," the man called Earl replied. He turned to me. "Be that as it 
may. I can spot anything in a football match in a matter of seconds. I have successfully stopped three attempted 
bombings at football stadiums. One look at the TV screen and I know what everyone is doing."</p>
<p>I nodded. "Ok… and what does bitching superpowers look like?"</p>
<p>"That…" the man said, eyes down on me, "is what you are here to find out." He turned back. "Bring the prisoner!"</p>
<p>Two figures in robe rose from their seats and disappeared in the darkness behind them. A second later they were 
back, carrying tiki torches with one hand, a man in shackles in the middle of them. They dragged the man all the way to the center of the circle and dropped him on his knees in front of me.</p>
<p>"This is Sid," Earl the bearded guy said. "He is a murderer. He has killed eight prostitutes in the last twelve 
months, and no one will arrest him because his father is an influential politician in the country he comes from.</p>
<p>"Uh-hum," I said, looking down at Sid. He looked up at me in anger and spat on the floor.</p>
<p>Earl took a step forward, standing between me and Sid. The tiki torch's fire over my head warmed the right side of 
my face.</p>
<p>"Now…" Earl said, looking from Sid to me. "Bitch."</p>
<p>The robed figures all rose to their feet and stepped closer. The circle closed in. "Bitch... bitch... bitch," they chanted.</p>
<p>I studied Sid's dirty face. He was breathing fast, grunting in anger.</p>
<p>"Ok…" I said. I thought about it. Then, "I always forget to take out the seasoning package of my instant ramen before dumping the whole thing into boiling water. And then I have to try and fish the packet out with two spoons like an idiot, and it makes me mad."</p>
<p>For a second, nothing happened. Then Sid's eyes went wide. Then wider. Then he opened his mouth and water 
started coming out of it. Boiling water.</p>
<p>Sid screamed. Bubbling, steaming water poured from his nose. His eyes. From his ears, two packets of 
chicken seasoning sprouted out and fell to the floor. Sid screamed and screamed and fell.</p>
<p>Cooked Ramen sprouted from his pores, painted red in blood. He let out a final yell, coughed a Louisiana Spicy 
packet and fell silent.</p>
<p>I looked from his dead body to Earl to the other robed figures, who were all standing in awe.</p>
<p>"Cool…" I said, smiling for the first time that week. </p>

<p>It's been 3 weeks now since the epic thread on Reddit has ballooned to be the biggest source of information on the whole internet.  Since we woke up and found that we could not leave our houses, the whole telecommunication world has been crippled. Phones will barely work and communication is at a minimum.  Even getting to web pages take ages to load.  </p>
<p>According to media sites, the death toll is already very high as most people did not have enough food in their houses to sustain them for a long period of time.  Lucky for me, I have been preparing for the worst my entire life.  I have around 3 months of food and water stored, but I know it won't last me for much longer.</p>
<p>For some reason even the glass has become seemingly bullet proof.  We have tried hitting it with anything we can find, and even tried shooting it once (the bullet ricocheted around the apartment and we don't want to try that again).  </p>
<p>The worst is the nights.  Since people can't leave, the power has been slowly fading as the people that were already at the power plants have been stuck working nonstop, taking mini shifts but still not able to keep awake enough to do a good job.</p>
<p>Sometimes the power goes out and everything becomes very dark.  I keep hearing scratching outside my doors and windows, so I know something is out there, and it doesn't sound very human.  Hopefully the stuck doors keep whatever is out there where it is.  </p>
<p>I have read some stories about people successfully escaping from their house, but soon after, never to be heard from again.  Hopefully someone can figure out what is actually happening soon, I don't know how much longer I can take being cooped up.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's right, father," the demon said, eyes closed. "Give it to me! Give me that God power!"</p>
<p>"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I cast you <em>out</em>!"</p>
<p>"I'm coming out!" The demon bellowed.</p>
<p>"<em>Out</em>!"</p>
<p>"I'm coming!"</p>
<p>"<em>OUT!</em>"</p>
<p>The demon flopped his head back onto the pillow. "Sorry, Father. It's not happening. I wanted it to, but I'm not feeling it. It's just..."</p>
<p>The priest lowered his arms. "No, it's not you, it's me. Sorry, this is a little weird for me. I've never done it this way before."</p>
<p>"It's not your fault," the demon said. "Usually I'm trying so hard to hold myself in. When I'm actually straining to release myself... I don't know, I guess I'm psyching myself out?" He shrugged. </p>
<p>The priest raised his eyebrows. "Maybe a little roleplaying would help?"</p>
<p>The demon smiled. "What are you suggesting?"</p>
<p>"Well, if trying to do what I say just makes it harder, maybe you should pretend to resist?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... Yeah, okay. Let's give it a try. Do you-- Are you going to start, or?"</p>
<p>The priest stuttered. "Um, I-- Yeah, yeah, I'll start." He cleared his throat, feeling nervous. "Hear my command! In the name of our Lord I demand that you acknowledge my power!"</p>
<p>"You have none, puny servant of God!" The demon snarled. "This man's soul is mine! You cannot touch me!"</p>
<p>"Silence, beast! Your words are meaningless, and will not deter me!"</p>
<p>"Your faith is nothing against the power of Hell!" The demon's eyes flicked to the flask of holy water on the nightstand. "And whatever you do," he hissed, "don't dare splash me with that foul holy water!"</p>
<p>A smile twitched at the priest's mouth before he recovered himself. He picked up the flask. "Feel the power of Christ's ointment, foul creature!" He uncapped the flask and splashed it's contents on the demon's face. </p>
<p>"GAAH!" The demon screamed. "Fiend! You got it in my hair!"</p>
<p>"Taste the sweet essence of the Lord!" Water gurgled from the flask.</p>
<p>"ARRGH! I <em>won't</em> be banished, priest! I don't care how much of your fluid you douse me with!"</p>
<p>"Begone, demon! In Christ's name, I command that you leave this man in <em>peace</em>!" The priest thrust his cross into the demon's face.</p>
<p>"NOOO!" The demon howled. His host began to choke and cough, and smoke, black as pitch, billowed from his mouth in a rush. A horrible sucking sound filled the room as the demon was expelled from the man's body. Finally, the exorcism was complete, and the demon hovered above his host in a roiling black cloud. "Whew!" The demon said. </p>
<p>The priest slumped down onto the bed, and sighed. The man lying on it was unconscious. "Now <em>that</em> was an exorcism."</p>
<p>The demon paused. "Um. You know, I could possess him again, if you're ready for round two?"</p>

<h4>[WP] A superhero whose punches heal rather than harm. Their origin story is kicking the shit out of a kid with terminal cancer.</h4>
<p>Score: 2054</p>
<p><em>Chris this, Chris that. Chris, you're so cool. Chris, let me help you with that. I'm sick of this shit.</em></p>
<p>Chris Mayer, the freshmen who just joined high school, was loved by everyone immediately. The girls, the guys, the jocks, the losers- everyone wanted to be his friend. Me? It was my senior year. </p>
<p>One day, I was eating lunch in a bathroom stall and just grew sick of it all. Sick of the unfair bullshit, the way people were nice to him but hated me. It was just because of his cancer, I knew it damn well. Worst of all was the way he smiled at me, or waved and said hi to me like nothing was wrong. It was him I hated most. </p>
<p>June 19th: the day I graduated from high school. My uncle was there, but no other family, and certainly no friends. Yet there that little bastard was, IV rack in hand, cheering and clapping for the senior class. Someone dedicated a speech to him. Everyone gathered around him after the ceremony. My uncle left halfway through, before I even got on stage. </p>
<p>I left before the midnight party began, just after sunset. Since my uncle had abandoned me, I was forced to take a bus stop that was almost a mile away. I took a shortcut through a side alleyway to the building our graduation had been held in, where I found Chris bent over and retching violently.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear," he said weakly, forcing a small laugh. "I came here so no one would see me like this. It's pretty bad these days."</p>
<p>No words formed in my mind; there was only an animalistic rage swirling, mudding my thoughts. I pummeled the living shit out of that frail, little boy. Every punch was vindication, every tooth knocked loose a symbol for my shattered dignity. Soon I was just taking out all my angers on him; my family, my loneliness, my uselessness. He was an emotional punching bag I'd made literal.</p>
<p>By the time I stopped, it was too late. Fuck, there was so much blood on me and the road, and his twisted little body. And yet, through labored breaths, through broken bones and missing teeth, he tried to smile. He tried to say something to me as well, but the blood pooling in his throat left the words inaudible before he started choking. </p>
<p>I ran. I didn't call for help, I just ran. No one caught me, somehow, and he died that night in a hospital bed. Not from the cancer eating away at him, but from my fists. I cried the whole night, and couldn't sleep for three days because every time I closed my eyes, I saw his mangled little face trying to smile. That whole time, it was <em>me</em> I hated, not him. </p>
<p>That night, I went home and punched myself in the face as hard as I could. I wanted to give myself a taste of what I'd given the poor boy in his last few hours, to feel what he felt, but no matter how many times I hit my face... I felt nothing. I checked a mirror to see if I'd just broken myself, but I looked sharper than ever.</p>
<p>Ever since then, I've haven't been able to hurt someone with a punch. In fact...I heal them, like my hands are imbued with the life I stole from him. Hands I'm afraid of, because I know he's haunting me.</p>
<p>I don't know how...</p>
<p>...but I wish they'd worked that way on the day I graduated. </p>

<p>Dan always had the coolest parents.  He could do whatever he wanted and they never seemed to care.  Most of the time they weren't around.  When they were they just told us to have those microwave meals and "take care of ourselves" like we were adults too.  My mom never let me have those microwave meals, she said they were bad for you, and she was always nagging me to do my homework.  Not like Dan's parents, we could do whatever we wanted there.</p>
<p>I remember when we would make pretend armies and wage war for control of the Carpet Kingdom.  The cans were our infantry, the small bottles were the cavalry and the bigger bottles were the artillery.  We would have huge armies and fight over the whole house, from one end of the carpet to the other.</p>
<p>Today his parents had let him set up a swing in their house.  He had attached one end of the rope to a light fixture and the other end kept his feet dangling off the ground.  I gave him a push and he swung back and forth.  "When do I get to go?" I asked.  He didn't say anything, but he never said much.  I couldn't wait for my turn.</p>

<h4>[WP] Every time someone masturbates to you, you receive a notification on your phone letting you know who did it.</h4>
<p>Score: 2025</p>
<p>It's been ages. I haven't gotten any blips since before my marriage, not even from my now-ex. I'll admit it, I let myself go a bit when her and I got serious but the looks decent wagon didn't exactly pass me by. I used to get a couple a day in college but they were usually from people I barely socialized with.</p>
<p>The lack of blips put a strain on my marriage. The storm really came to a head when I was trying to talk to Angela about our dead bedroom and how she doesn't even play to the thought of me anymore. She told me, "Well what the fuck does it matter? I know you're getting off daily."</p>
<p>A lot more was said, mainly her calling me a fat pig and me dropping the C-bomb. I left that night and stayed with my brother, Shawn. I talked with him about getting my fitness back on track and he gave me some pointers: eat less crap, hit the gym, track calories, all of that stuff. I didn't see much progress in the first couple of months until I decided to put on my big girl panties and really grind it out. In the mornings I'd run a couple of kilometres as fast as I could, cut out processed food, and lifted weights in the evening. My food staples were veggies, chicken, fish, and rice. I set goals for when I hit the iron.</p>
<p>A month on, I needed to buy a new belt. Another month, new clothes. I felt amazing. More energy, more confidence, better sleep, and I didn't even care about the blips that I wasn't getting at that point. I had actually forgotten all about it. I was too focused on making myself better, the best I could be. Faster. Stronger. The Iron Temple was my place of worship, and I devoted to it my body, mind, and soul.</p>
<p>Then, eight months from the start of my journey, I got a blip one morning. I was nervous. I didn't check it at work. I didn't check it on my way home. I waited until I was in the bedroom of my new apartment, my heart in my throat. I opened the app.</p>
<p>"Shawn has just masturbated to you!"</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the kind comments, y'all are rock stars. Just like to clarify that the main character is male, I used the line "big girl panties" because it's a thing that people say to guys who need to "man up". </p>

<p>Existing is something I'm not sure I've ever felt before. One minute I wasn't, now I was.</p>
<p>My first memories beyond the white abyss are staring at a djinni with a bored look on his face, and a slightly overweight and visibly sweating young man. He stammered something that resembled a hello, before falling silent. He looked shocked.</p>
<p>I knew what had happened, instinctively. He had used his wish for me, the most beautiful woman imaginable. When something like this happens, they send me.</p>
<p>I'm not pretty, conventionally. I've got muddy brown eyes, darkish brown hair, pale skin, a bit of an underbite. I'm short, a little too short, actually, with a small bust and a mediocre figure. </p>
<p>I was willed into existence, and will be willed into existence, every time a wish is granted that calls for someone beautiful. The cosmic joke is that I'm supposed to represent inner beauty, and when the man finds out how nice I am, it's supposed to make him a better person.</p>
<p>What actually happens is the man never hesitates, and uses his second wish to wish me away. Or for a real beautiful woman, which actually gets him one. Sometimes they just leave me with the lamp, and as soon as they get far enough away I return to nonexistence. </p>
<p>The present man, still speechless, drops the lamp and runs to me, crying into my hoodie. The djinni departs, his cruel bargain struck. I prepare for the inevitable disjunction, but it never comes.</p>
<p>He simply stays by my side, holding me like someone who has never held anyone before and knows he may never again. I hold him back.</p>

<p>"Hey Kay, you want some tea?" Arthur calls from the kitchen. I look up from my sudoku and smile. He's so thoughtful like that, he never leaves a room without thinking of me.</p>
<p>I accept the tea with a grin, trusting he's put the right amount of milk and sugar in. He sits next to me and we snuggle together. Outside the rain falls, a backdrop just loud enough to drown out the real world. </p>
<p>I kiss him. He kisses me back.</p>

<p>The light was the first thing I noticed, before the voice that is, it was almost blinding when I finally came to.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, you'll get used to the light again."</p>
<p>I shook my head as my eyes grew accustomed to the light. I wasn't sure where exactly I was, or how I got here, but I did remember dying. Or at least, it felt like death. You know, I had my whole family there. I was old, living out my final days in the comfort of my childhood home. My kids were there, and so were their kids, and even a few of my great-grandchildren. I had lived a good life.</p>
<p>"He's reliving his last moments," a second voice said. It was feminine, unlike the first.</p>
<p>"That's normal. Open the pod."</p>
<p>There was a light hissing sound as, what I realized was clear glass, opened in front of me. The room around was artificial, I knew that, but it was almost too artificial. Like it was made up in some lab a thousand miles away, never to be touched by mankind.</p>
<p>I finally saw who the two voices belonged to. The second was a female, as I assumed. She stood tall, posture was perfect, and her hair looked just like my daughters. Wanda. That was her name, I <em>knew</em> it.</p>
<p>The first voice was a man who looked old but had to be thirty years my younger. Or, was he my younger? I looked at my hands, my eyes drifting between the man's long grey beard and my own hands. They weren't wrinkly anymore. No, they were soft and <em>calloused</em>. I nodded.</p>
<p>"How was Heaven?"</p>
<p>I almost laughed at God's comment, that wasn't his <em>actual</em> name, that's just what everyone called him around here. He was the Creator and the Savior, and just about everything in between.</p>
<p>"Better," I finally managed to croak out, my voice was coarse. From the pod, the fluids they fed me, I remembered that too. "I made it to ninety-seven." I coughed a bit, thick pockets of dried phlegm coming out of the back of my throat.</p>
<p>"We watched your progress. A perfect run."</p>
<p>I agreed. "I can do better. Next time I go in."</p>
<p>Wanda sighed at the comment and then I remembered.</p>
<p>My eyes shut and my hands found their way to my face. I rubbed at it, trying to get the feeling back, trying to make my brain work again. "What'd you learn?"</p>
<p>"We threw everything we could at Heaven this time, tried to find what failed here. Unfortunately, your path as a Doctor and not a Politician as we agreed didn't help much."</p>
<p>"I had limited options with the background you gave me."</p>
<p>God waved his hands, "All part of the test, which you did pass by the way."</p>
<p>I reached for the towel Wanda was now handing me. One of the downsides to our home was the cold, and the fact that you had to be naked going in the pod. I cleaned myself off before stepping out and heading towards my locker.</p>
<p>"How'd the others do?"</p>
<p>"Seven were successful, including you," Wanda said. She was reading from her clipboard, I knew that. "Thirteen failed. Three critical. One death."</p>
<p>I shuddered, one of the downsides of Heaven, if you died there from causes not specifically coded, you had trouble getting <em>back</em>. "Who?"</p>
<p>"I think you need rest before we debrief you, L."</p>
<p>I turned back to them and threw on my jumpsuit, a dark crimson color, to denote my status as God's second. "Who?"</p>
<p>God sighed, "Jasper. He died in the war that plagued your nation, complications arose when we tried to wake him. He never came to."</p>
<p>I sighed, Jasper was a great solider, servant, and a better friend. I would miss him deeply. "So, what did you learn? I have one KIA, three in critical, and nine fails. I want some answers."</p>
<p>Wanda shook her head, "Unfortunately, we don't have many. We attributed some of the pitfalls to the aspects of humanity of the time. Others to random factors."</p>
<p>"That's it?" I petitioned, "<em>Random</em> factors?"</p>
<p>God took my shoulder, "Yes. In the end, a world with free will," he sighed, "it will always have chaos. The necessity of man, to say the least."</p>
<p>I shook my head, "Then how do you fix that? Free will, I mean, you found everything on that belief. All of us here do."</p>
<p>God turned to Wanda, who smiled for a moment, "We have one solution as of now. For the next phase."</p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow, "You're going ahead with it? The Creation?"</p>
<p>God nodded, "I am. After millennia of searching for answers, after thousands of iterations of heavens, fallen children, your brothers and sisters."</p>
<p>I held up my hand and nodded. I remembered. Every single day I remembered. Their names, their faces. Everything about them.</p>
<p>"I am splitting us up."</p>
<p>I looked back to God, "You're doing what?"</p>
<p>Wanda chimed in, "In all of our ideas. We had the Creation and we had us, here. We feed the Creation what it needs and they eventually come back to us. However," Wanda took a deep breath, "however, sometimes it fails. In worse ways than just death."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"We lose every essence of the one we sent in." God shook his head, "I will not allow that."</p>
<p>"So how do you fix it while maintaining free will?"</p>
<p>"We create a third plane of existence. One the Created would come to fear."</p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow, "Fear?"</p>
<p>God nodded, "Yes. In that plane, they would be judged and sentenced. It would be for all who do not fulfill their life's purpose. For those who need more time."</p>
<p>I nodded, "So the Judgement is made, they do the punishment and then go back?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and they keep trying. Again and again."</p>
<p>"Until it works," Wanda finished. "I already ran the diagnostics with the other  engineers. It will work."</p>
<p>"Who decides the Judgement?"</p>
<p>God lowered his head, "You will."</p>
<p>I stepped back, "<em>What</em>?"</p>
<p>"Wanda, a moment," God ordered and she didn't hesitate. She left the room almost immediately and God turned back to me. "You are my most-trusted asset. My greatest Creation. For that, you must lead the plane that the other Created will fear."</p>
<p>"You want me to go in a plane not created? You want me to create another?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Until the Created are ready, I need a second guide."</p>
<p>I shook my head, "I did my time. My penance is done. I proved it time and time again in Heaven."</p>
<p>"It is why I chose you and not another." God grabbed both my arms, "Lucifer. You must fall, so your brothers and sisters can rise again. They are stuck, their minds, their souls, in that plane. The millions that exist there <em>can</em> exist here again." God sighed, "But I need you to guide them."</p>
<p>I lowered my head, "How long?"</p>
<p>"As long as it takes them to redeem themselves."</p>
<p>"Will you help me?"</p>
<p>"I taught you all there is to know about the Existent Planes already. It is up to you to create one they will fear."</p>
<p>I stared at the ground, my heart pumped fast and my eyes grew heavy. The responsbility was overwhelming, but it was not something I could refuse. I nodded. "Okay." I looked back at him, "I will fall for them."</p>
<p>God smiled, and so did I, "Then let's get started."</p>

<p>"Never had a religion or a code of ethics?" one of the judges raised an eyebrow. Kendra couldn't really tell them apart, but there was only one that spoke. </p>
<p>"Not that I remember," Kendra began to play with the hem of her dress. "But a lot of it is blank. I don't...I don't <em>think</em> I did."</p>
<p>"That's ok," the judge waved his hand. "Sometimes we just like to get outside opinions."</p>
<p>Kendra thought there was something seemingly off about this, but couldn't put her finger quite on what. She swallowed as the chair turned back around and she looked up at the screen. </p>
<p>It was like watching life through someone's eyes. There were little snippets of action - the world opening up like a flower in bloom and seeing two faces looking down at her. A man in a mask and a woman who held her close. </p>
<p>There was the sound of crying and babbling. A muffled argument late at night while a mobile spun lazily above her head. The sound of a woman singing and the surprising feel of a hand in hers. </p>
<p>Kendra jumped, pulling her hand from the armrest into her lap. Behind her there came laughter. "Don't be alarmed," the voice of the judge. "This will feel quite real at times."</p>
<p>Slowly the world began to shift from horizontal to vertical. Trees that had seemed massive began to shrink. There was a man's face that peered down at her with disappointment. A sharp pain across her face and around her upper arm. A whisper that wound its way into her ear. <em>Don't you ever tell a soul.</em></p>
<p>A young child that sneered at her and taunted her with cries of <em>chicken legs</em> and <em>freak</em>. The running of a sink and hearing sniffling sounds that reached her own ears. </p>

<p>A small dark space. A sniffling cry. A begging to be let out that poured from her own mouth. The sound of a key and the smell of mothballs. The twisting of a doorknob and a tray of food shoved inside. </p>
<p>"Please," her voice begged. "Please!"</p>
<p>A man who held her hand and told her it would be alright. The embarrassment of finding red between her legs in the middle of a science class. The chilly inside of a car on a winter's morning as she pulled a sweater tight around herself for warmth. </p>
<p>Sitting on the side of the road with an empty cup. Looking at the faces of those disgusted with her. Walking into a store and shoving her pockets full of things. Her own hand brandishing a knife at a woman on the street. </p>
<p>A bridge at night. A whooshing wind. A splash of ice. </p>
<p>The picture faded. Kendra sat still and raised her hand to her face to find it wet. The chair spun again until she again faced the men in black. </p>
<p>"So what do you think?"</p>
<p>Kendra started. "What do I think? I don't know. I think it's horrible. But I don't know if it's good or bad. Just sad. And the ending..."</p>
<p>"You feel sympathy for her?"</p>
<p>"Of course. Only pain and suffering could drive her to an end like that."</p>
<p>"What about her sins?" The man gave a wry smile. "What about the theft? The sloth? The knife?"</p>
<p>"I feel nothing but sympathy and sadness for her," Kendra said. </p>
<p>"Do you think you could forgive her?"</p>
<p>"Forgive her? What has she done to me?"</p>
<p>"Could you forgive your mother for leading such a life? Your best friend? Your child? For taking the easy way out?"</p>
<p>"She suffered so." Kendra paused. "Of course. I just wish there was another option. To try again. I wish I could hold her hand and tell her it wasn't her fault. I wish I could give her happiness."</p>
<p>"What about yourself?"</p>
<p>Slowly the memories bloomed in Kendra's mind. She sat stunned as they flooded back. Her eyes began to sting and her throat began to tighten. "That was...that was..."</p>
<p>"Can you show yourself the same kindness and forgiveness you would show to someone else? Can you allow yourself to see the pain and desperation that <em>you</em> felt without the judgement or the self hatred?"</p>
<p>Kendra stared at them and said nothing. It felt as though someone had reached into her chest to squeeze her heart. </p>
<p>The judge smiled. "Ah yes. It's much easier to see our pain when we see it through someone else's eyes. Why don't you try again? See if you can show yourself more kindness."</p>
<p>The judge reached out to push a button. Then, as though she had been pulled into a vacuum, the world went black. </p>

<h4>[WP] Write a story about something you don't understand. Do NO research. Make everything up as you go.</h4>
<p>Score: 1998</p>
<p>"Alright Dr. Cameron, it appears that the patient is going to need a triple bypass if they are going to live," Dr. Ericson casually quipped over a lukewarm cup of joe.</p>
<p>It did indeed appear that the patient was having a difficult time with getting his poor heart to cooperate with him, as he had apparently recently taken to participating in butter drinking competitions all around the United States.</p>
<p>I thought to myself for a moment, then replied "Yeah, I guess so. Probably time to move him to the ER." The patient had been very unconscious for the past 15 minutes or so.</p>
<p>The patient was strapped to a gurney and transported from the waiting room and wheeled into an operating room by a team of medical personnel. It was about 3:00 AM, and all of the staff were nearing exhaustion. I followed the rest of the nurses to the operating room soon after, and Dr. Ericson was sipping his coffee right next to the operating table.</p>
<p>As a wave of tiredness came over me, I had to strain myself mentally to remember my medical training, lest this man die on my table. <em>Alright first step... Yeah, I think i should probably wash my hands so i don't give him an infection.</em></p>
<p>As I scrubbed my hands, Dr. Ericson put his gloves on and pulled out his tray of surgical instruments. "Ready doctor?" He asks me through his surgical mask.</p>
<p>"Yep, as long as I stay awake," I reply. Tonight was going to be a long night. I put my latex gloves on, and as I approached the table, I saw that the patient was fully prepared for me, ready to go. First, I asked the nurse for a scalpel and made a vertical incision about 8 inches long above the sternum.</p>
<p>And this is exactly where I forgot what I was supposed to do. Embarrassed, I asked Dr. Ericson "So, remember back to med school? If I were testing you now, what would you say the next step would be?"</p>
<p>"Uh, I guess it would help to get through the ribcage," Dr. Ericson replied. "I think there is probably a hacksaw for that around here somewhere."</p>
<p>It became apparent to me then, that Dr. Ericson was under the same spell of fatigue that I was. He began clanking around a few drawers looking for the saw, when a nurse began to ask "Hey doctor, aren't you supposed to..."</p>
<p>"Quiet, nurse," I interjected. I wasn't about to have some under-educated peon lecture me on how to do my job.</p>
<p>The clanking stopped, and Dr. Ericson looked up from his drawer "Found one!" he exclaimed as he held it high: a rusted hacksaw covered in white paint chips, clearly last used for woodworking.</p>
<p>I replied to the doctor, "Well, it'll have to do, I guess." The nurses were all giving each other terrified glances at this point, but must have been to afraid to say anything else. I took the saw from Dr. Ericson, and as I was about to begin, I remembered something rather important.</p>
<p>"Dr. Ericson, have you administered anesthesia yet?" I asked. The patient was unconscious for now, but probably wouldn't remain that way if I had begun my violent assault on his sternum.</p>
<p>"Oops." was his only reply. He strolled over to the medicine cabinet, and grabbed a bottle of morphine. He inserted a syringe into the bottle, and drew the plunger to about 30mL. "This'll do," he remarked to himself.</p>
<p>The morphine was injected intravenously, and the operation proceeded. The sternum was hard to make it through with the hacksaw, but five minutes and elbow grease are enough to saw through mostly anything.</p>
<p>I didn't remember what the device to hold the ribcage open was called, and I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of these dumbass nurses again, so I told one of them to keep the rib cage open by holding the halves apart. With their hands. Now, I could see the bottom tip of the heart beneath the patient's lungs. Still mostly inaccessible, so I cut the connective tissue keeping the lungs in place, and spread them out to the sides like wings. Unfortunately, the lungs weren't functioning any more.</p>
<p>"You. Nurse. Go get one of those things that you pump into his mouth so he can breathe," I ordered.</p>
<p>"A... what?" The obviously horrified and anxious nurse replied.</p>
<p>Unable to remember what the device was called, I sighed and said, "Just... perform mouth-to-mouth for the remainder of the procedure."</p>
<p>At this point, the area around the table was beginning to become crowded with nurses crawling all over this poor man, to keep his ribs open and to keep him breathing. I looked to check the EKG to see if his vitals were still good, at which point I realized that I forgot to connect one. I ordered the nurses to set one up, and after everything was set up, I noticed that his blood pressure was very low.</p>
<p>"We are going to need to give this man a blood transfusion," I stated. "Dr Ericson, would you be so kind to set up the transfusion?"</p>
<p>"Sure thing," He replied. Taking a bag of O-negative out of the freezer, he thawed it under his armpit for a couple of minutes and then inserted it into IV, commanding a nurse to hold the bag up and let gravity do the rest of the work.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, blood pressure began to return to normal. With his heart exposed, the real operation could begin. At this moment, I remembered that a bypass surgery involved taking veins from the legs and using them to "bypass" the clots, but I could not for the life of me remember which veins to take. From the look on Dr. Ericson's face, he couldn't either. Attempting to save face, I asked Dr. Ericson "Would you be so kind as to perform the vessel removal from this patient's left leg?"</p>
<p>He turned bright red, and began to look around the room. "Me? Now?"</p>
<p>I just stared at him for a minute.</p>
<p>"Fine." He grabbed a scalpel and cut into the patient's left leg, and removed a 6 inch segment of the largest vessel he could find, and what remained of it began to bleed profusely.</p>
<p>I had no idea what to do at this point, I was just too tired. "Well, shit. I guess we'll have to amputate. I don't think we can save that leg.</p>
<p>The nurses obviously didn't agree with what was going on, with their judgmental, wide-eyed stares and heavy breathing. They weren't the ones holding the scalpel, so they could piss off for all I cared. </p>
<p>I took the hack saw from before, and went to work. The leg was faster to come off than the sternum, that was immediately apparent. However, it was also bleeding much more heavily. I ordered another nurse to throw on another bag of O-negative and squeeze. I couldn't remember the rest of the amputation procedure, but I remembered back to an episode of <em>The Walking Dead</em> that I saw in season one, where some redneck cut off his own hand to escape some handcuffs and sear it with a hot pan, cauterizing the wound. I elected to go with this procedure.</p>
<p>We threw the leg in the bio hazard bag, as it probably couldn't be reattached and we already had the vein we needed. I cut it into three sections, one for each of the vessels that we need to bypass. Then another reality hit me; I had forgotten which three of the four vessels needed to be bypassed. A cold sweat came over me, my vision began to tunnel. I done goofed. I can't even remember how to test for which ones needed the bypass. Time to wing it, I guess.</p>
<p>I decided to go with vessels 1, 2, and 4, because of a video I saw with three numbered escaped greased pigs that I saw earlier, with the prank being that the #3 one was nonexistent and people would keep looking for it. I cut small holes on either side of where I believe a clot would be, and attached the veins with my trusty tube of Elmer's super glue. Monitoring the patient's vitals, it appeared that it worked, since some of the numbers began shifting around and it wasn't beeping at me.</p>
<p>I glanced at Dr. Cameron, who gave me a wink and a thumbs up. I knew that two doctors couldn't possibly be wrong, so everything must be going well. Only three nurses left during the procedure, two of them due to physical exhaustion from holding the patient's ribs open and one due to a bout of unconsciousness. Must have been too squeamish to assist during open heart surgery, they shouldn't have even been allowed to graduate med school.</p>
<p>I placed the lungs back to their native position, and used super glue in the place of where I made the earlier incisions to disconnect them. I relieved the rib-holder nurse of duty, and stapled the sternum back together. I asked Dr. Ericson to finish sewing the patient back up while I remove my gloves and wash my hands. After taking one last look at his vitals and determining that they probably looked fine, I ordered the nurses to bring the patient to a recovery room where he would remain until he woke, at which point he would be sent home.</p>
<p>Due to reasons unknown to me, none of them responded, or even looked in my direction for that matter. They cleaned the blood off of the patient and wheeled him out. Sighing a sigh of relief, i turn to Dr. Ericson. "Just another day on the job, right?"</p>
<p>"Yep. I guess we'll see what tomorrow brings."</p>
<p>"We sure will."</p>
<p>Dr. Ericson and I donned our coats, and returned to the parking lot. He finished his coffee on the way to his car.</p>

<h4>[WP] It's been almost two years since people stopped dying, and five months since we started to burn the ones that should.</h4>
<p>Score: 1998</p>
<p>For some it was the best of times. For others it was the worst of times. For still others, it was an amalgamation of the two that they didn't quite know how to handle. Economists tried to weigh in on it and say that the new job sector gave wages to millions across the globe. The ethicists said it wasn't fair. </p>
<p>All I knew was that <em>my</em> job had drastically changed. </p>
<p>They used to call us firefighters. Now they just call us firemen. Our jobs have changed from preventing fires to starting them. Some of us quit, and some of us changed to the police force or paramedics. But I've always had a mean streak, and so along with some of the sociopaths and criminals and arsonists of the world, I rose up as a new pillar in society. </p>
<p>A fireman. </p>
<p>The idea wasn't original, and anyone who has two flecks of fluff for brain will know where it came from. The High Order - that's what they all changed their name to after it became clear none of them could be assassinated - saw books and people as the same. Don't want a book around? Reduce it to ash. Don't want a human around? </p>
<p>Well, you get where I'm going. </p>
<p>It was a job, alright. At first it had just been the elderly. Just because people stopped dying didn't mean they <em>should</em> have stopped dying. There were people who were 106, wasting away and smelling of decomposition, with sores across their bodies, completely lost to the world. There were cancer patients who had been so eaten away that they barely looked human. There were accident victims whose bodies had succumbed to sepsis while their minds stayed fresh and aware. </p>
<p>Those were the first to go. We called them Tier 1. The News called the mercy killings, but the High Order stuck to Tier 1. </p>
<p>Then we brought in Tier 2. The criminals and low lives, the serial rapists who had figured out that they could torture their victims and never kill them. The scum that wasn't worth what you scraped off your shoe. </p>
<p>The kerosene from my hose sprayed over the building. I had grown used to the smell, and it sent a small shiver down my spine with every application. An electronic beeped near my ear to indicate if enough kerosene had been discharged. </p>
<p>Once that was set, I signaled to my coworker. The kerosene drained from the hose until only drips remained. My coworker reeled it back in. </p>
<p>It was my favorite part. The ignition. I held the lighter, flipping the cap down and back up, inhaling. There was not a sound from inside the building. There would be soon.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when I returned to the truck the air was filled with screams. I turned toward my coworker.</p>
<p>"Which Tier is this?" </p>
<p>"Tier 3." </p>
<p>"Didn't know there was a Tier 3. Who's in this batch?" </p>
<p>I looked back at the orange flames that licked the sky, bringing Heaven and Hell together as one. The best of times, the worst of times, or an amalgamation of the two. </p>
<p>"Dissenters." </p>

<p><em>Shit shit shit</em>  thought God. It was tough to display no emotion but a strong poker face was crucial. Dexicon had already taken Zeermon out the game and had now moved on to God.</p>
<p>God had not been blessed with much luck.  Each deity had been given a species that had space travel potential. The objective was to either enslave or obliterate the other species. God had unfortunately randomised the least intelligent possible species - homo.</p>
<p>2.7  million years just to leave the hunter gatherer stage. This was a new record. He had had to wipe out his first few species of homo and start over - they had simply been too stupid. By the time he had rerandomised into homo-sapien he was at least 2.6 million years behind Dexicon. </p>
<p>What didnt help was that the homo-sapiens turned out to be incredibly aggresive. This would be useful for fighting other species, but they mainly killed each other! Oh how Dexicon and Zeermon laughed! </p>
<p>When he had finally researched the abilty to send a vassel to Earth to enlighten and guide the people, the earthlings did something unprecedented in stupidity - they decided to kill it.</p>
<p>Finally the humans became space able. At the time, God was pleased. They visited their local moon first, as expected. But the moon base never came. The colonisation of nearby planets never came. They regressed.</p>

<p>"We talked to him," Zed replied. "He's doing a movie about Wall Street and the housing market crisis."</p>
<p>"Beautiful! An industry that makes billions every year and controls the mass media in the most powerful country in the world criticizing capitalism! It's a winner!"</p>
<p>"We also got Bryan Cranston doing a screenwriter blacklisted during the communist witch hunt."</p>
<p>"Perfect!"</p>
<p>"And Michael Fassbender doing Steve Jobs – written by Aaron Sorkin, no less." Zed spoke that last part with pride, 
like he knew how good it was.</p>
<p>"We're covered, man!" I said, happily. "We're covered! No way Leo's getting it this year!"</p>
<p>"And…" Zed smirked, and leaned forwards, resting his chin on his hands on his elbows on the table (god, what an 
awful sentence). "We've got Matt Damon in Mars."</p>
<p>"Fuck, Zed!" I leaned back, lighting a cigar. "We've outdone ourselves this time! There is <em>no </em>way* Leo takes this 
Oscar."</p>
<p>Zed smiled at me, lighting his cigar too. Another year, another success. We were covered.</p>
<p>Or so we thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What the fuck happened!?" Zed is yelling at me now, blocking the view of the TV, where the pre-show girl in the 
cleavage interviews Chloe Moretz on E!'s red carpet special.</p>
<p>"I don’t know! I don't know!"</p>
<p>"I organized everything so well! I talked to producers, I talked to the actors, I moved mountains to get these movies made! And you're telling me Leo is the favorite!? How can that be!?"</p>
<p>"Zed, I don't know how it happened!" I stuff my face in my hands. Then I raise my eyes. "Apparently people weren't in the mood for yet another Jobs movie, or watching Matt Damon get rescued again. Steve Carell wasn't even nominated for Big Short, and <em>not even Bryan Cranston saw Trumbo!</em>"</p>
<p>"Well, this is it. Humanity is doomed," Zed cries, as the lady announces that we're just five minutes away from the 
ceremony. "The second Leo gets his hand on that Oscar, it's all over. He'll destroy the Earth." He pauses. "We gotta do something, man!"</p>
<p>"It's too late now, Zed," I say, shaking my head. "Let's just call our families. Say our goodbyes."</p>
<p>"Unless…" Zed stops, turning his eyes to me, his hand on his chin on his knee on the couch (fuck it, I'm wearing it with pride now).</p>

<p>"We could call… <em>him</em>."</p>
<p>"You don't mean…"</p>
<p>"Yes I mean him." Zed gets up and takes three fast steps towards me, resting his hand on my shoulders.  "It's our only hope."</p>
<p>"Zed, he's an alien. Plus, it's too late, the Oscars start in two minutes."</p>
<p>"So? He can do it!"</p>
<p>"We can't put down a movie for Oscar consideration two minutes before the ceremony, Zed!"</p>
<p>"He can do it!" Zed roars. "You know he can!"</p>

<p>"What other choice do we have!?"</p>
<p>Zed's eyes are locked on mine. Dead serious.</p>

<p>One hour and forty minutes later, Zed and I are side by side on the couch, watching as Kate Mara finishes 
announcing the nominees for best actor in a lead role.</p>
<p>"It won't work," I say, quietly. "It won't work, not even <em>he</em> can pull this one out."</p>
<p>By my side, Zed watches in silence, his breath heavy and slow. Eyes locked on the screen.</p>
<p>And the Oscar goes to," Kate says, tearing the envelope open. "Leonardo Di –"</p>
<p>The applause starts, but stops at once as a man storms the stage. He whispers something in Kate's ear, then takes 
the envelope from her hand and gives her a second one, identical.</p>
<p>"We're very sorry," Kate says, in a hush. "But it looks like we have a sixth nominee." Clearing her throat, she tears 
the second envelope open. "Well… the Oscar goes to…" Her eyes go wide, and a smile crosses her face. "Matthew Mcconaughey, for 'Thirty Second Video Of Me Saying 'All Right, All Right, All Right' Uploaded To Youtube Just a Few Seconds Ago'"!</p>
<p>The winning music starts, and the camera switches to Leonardo DiCaprio's incredulous face. Zed jumps up in the 
air. "He did it! The motherfucker did it!"</p>
<p>I cry, getting up too and hugging Zed as we watch Matthew climbing up on the stage.</p>
<p>He takes the statue. Kisses Mara. Looks straight down at the first roll, frozen smile, eyes locked on Leo DiCaprio's face.</p>
<p>He raises the Oscar up in the air. Eyes still on Leo. </p>
<p>Takes a deep breath. Widens his smile.</p>

<p>I never understood why every superhero out there wore capes. I swear, the amount of raw fabric he goes through must be inversely proportionally to his IQ. My roommate is the self proclaimed "Second Most Powerful Hero to ever live." Never mind he hasn't ever faced off against any truly powerful super villain. Those were taken care of years upon years ago. </p>
<p>Let's break it down. Ryan, my roommate, has; heat vision, frost breath, super strength, skin that can stop bullets and lasers, the ability to breathe in space, and a laundry list of other abilities. He's made me time him flying to the moon and back. Usually I don't have time to press the stop watch. He's all hot air. Well, unless you put these funny green or red rocks near him. Something to do with his home world and all that. </p>
<p>I digress. Today has been strange indeed. He's insisted, once again that I time him. Something about wanting to feel his ranking. I kind of tune him out when he starts going on these rants about his powers. I just kind of tick on my fingers the ones that he's listed. More than anything I just want to tell him to shut up most of the time. However, I really can't. You see, I have a certain ability. An ability that makes the world a much better place than anyone can dream of. Day in and day out I save the world over and over again from a threat that's possibly strong enough to destroy the universe. I keep the idiots in the world cloaked in their own little bubbles. No supervillian has risen in my lifetime, nor will any. </p>
<p>If you haven't guessed yet. I am the most powerful superhero in existence. Not because of the powers I have, but because of what I do. I keep the biggest, most powerful idiot in existence, well, entertained. Well, that, and I can make a lot of copies of myself. So, for every hero that's out there I'm there. I'm watching them all drone on about being number two. After all, no one is more dangerous than someone with something to prove. However, when you're proving it to someone that doesn't care then the world is a much better place. </p>

<p>It wasn't all perfect, it had taken a few tries.  Free will can be a double edged sword sometimes.</p>
<p>But by and large the last few billion years have gone by without a hitch.  Watching his children learn to harness the power of the universe, explore, meet and share was one of his greatest pleasures.</p>
<p>In the end it boiled down to simplicity- The same small number of rules codified in each civilization did the trick.  Whether you lived in a gas giant or in the vacuum of space, 10 basic rules are really all you needed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a couple millennium ago a small planet forgot the basic rules.  It started with the idea of holding material goods and wealth as a higher God than him.  "That's kinda why I put that in there!  I don't care which version of me you worship, that's fine.  Just understand stupid stuff like minerals and worldly goods doesn't come before respecting my universe".</p>
<p>It truly hurt his heart to deal with the crisis.  It started off with a single taking of life of a fellow sentient over some chunk of gold.  Gold- he could literally make more for them- or they can go get more, the universe is full of it!  Then another taking of life a few hundred years later.  By the time nearly 2000 years had passed the species had managed to kill literally dozens of their own race.</p>
<p>He didn't understand it- Thou Shall Not Kill.  How much simpler could it get?  </p>
<p>The images haunted him- dozens of bodies, dozens of families left crushed.  How could he let this happen?  What the hell was wrong with them that they thought this was ok?  Why would they feel it's acceptable to literally have a murder or two every century, almost like clockwork?  </p>
<p>He was wary with that senseless loss of his beloved children.  He closed his eyes and played back each of their lives, and the dozens of children they left behind or were going to leave behind.  The gaps in the tapestry of his plan were small (it was only a few dozen threads), but he could feel it, he could see it, and it pained him so deeply.</p>
<p>With a sigh he finally turned his attention back to another part of his creation.</p>
<p>"Ahh, Eden!", he thought.  "This should cheer me up.  Beautiful and clever little children I made there.  Let's see how they are doing over there in the Milky Way."</p>

<h4>[WP] "What do you mean the robbers ADDED $4,000,000 to the vault?"</h4>
<p>Score: 1935</p>
<p>The two men ducked under the yellow police tape and peered through the heavy steel bars blocking the way to the vault. The damage was obvious even from this distance: the entire back wall had been reduced to rubble by heavy explosives, and a dark tunnel led underground. Following the tunnel would eventually lead to the bottom of Mr Singer's old tailor's shop, which hadn't been open for more than a year now after Mr. Singer's passing. According to the agents, no one had reported seeing anyone go in or out in the past few months, but <em>someone</em> had to have dug the tunnel. </p>
<p>"How much was the count again?" Agent Rodriguez asked. He looked every bit the FBI agent: tall and handsome, with a powerful jaw and stunning straight teeth. His black hair was cropped close in a buzz cut, and he had just the right amount of stubble dusted across his chin. He wore a dark suit, crisply starched shirt, a power tie, and even some heavily tinted aviator sunglasses. But his face seemed permanently set in a dour grimace; probably because we'd spent all of our time together inspecting this absurd crime scene. If you could even call it that. Was it a crime if the robbers had <em>given</em> you money?</p>
<p>"Last count on Friday showed that the vault contained 11.7 million in cash and other 1.9 million in bearer bonds," I told him. I'd done the count myself; I knew it was accurate. "Plus whatever is here in the safety deposit boxes. As far as we can tell, none of them were opened. Doesn't look like any damage was done to them, and they were all..."</p>
<p>"Don't count on it," Agent Lewis interrupted me. He leaned over, trying to see the safety deposit boxes through the bars. "If they weren't after the cash, then there has to be something else missing. We're going to need to go through an inventory of those and make sure that everything is still inside."</p>
<p>I gulped; it felt like I was trying to swallow a rock. A rock the size of my fist. "Yes sir," I meekly answered.</p>
<p>"The count?" Rodriguez asked with a dash of annoyance. "Don't get sidetracked, darlin'." That word really emphasized his Texan drawl. "You said they <em>added</em> cash to the shelves?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir." I unlocked the gate and led them into the vault, where the mystery pallet sat right next to the others, still on a handcart. A cart that didn't belong to the bank, mind you. "Another 4 million dollars in cash. Sequential serial numbers..." I pointed to the numbers visible through the plastic wrapping. "Hell, it looks like it's never even been touched!"</p>
<p>Agent Lewis removed a Swiss army knife from his pocket and sliced through the plastic wrapping on the pallet. He lifted a stack of hundreds and held it up to eye level. For the first time, he removed his sunglasses, revealing piercing blue eyes. He studied the bills closely, flipping through the stack like a picture book and examining the detailed watermarks. He even sniffed them. </p>
<p>"Ink's off," he told Rodriguez. "It's a pretty good fake, but definitely counterfeit. These guys are fucking pros."</p>
<p>I nearly smacked myself in the head. Counterfeit, of course! I hadn't even thought of that. I must have made a sound or something, because Rodriguez turned to me with a sympathetic smile. "Yeah, it's hard to tell. Almost looks legit, don't it?" </p>
<p>I nodded. The bills in his hand did look real, and I'd been working at this bank for the past decade.</p>
<p>"They're trying to get the counterfeits into circulation," he said. </p>
<p>"Why leave <em>more</em> than we had originally, though?" I asked. "What's the profit in that?"</p>
<p>The two agents looked at each other. "Well, we're not sure how much legitimate currency you've got left here. we're going to have to have a look around," Rodriguez finally answered. "Particularly at those safe deposit boxes. You mind fetchin' the key sets for us?"</p>
<p>I did as I was told and returned to the vault to remove the safety deposit boxes. One by one, I extracted the metal containers from the secured cabinet and placed them on the table, where the agents inspected them for any external damage. "We're going to need the customer keys to open them," I told the agents. </p>
<p>"Of course," Lewis growled. He shot me a 'does this look like my first rodeo' look and rolled his eyes. "So why don't you get us that list of customers so that we can contact them?" </p>
<p>I printed out a list from the bank's records and brought it to the agents. They'd finished inspecting the safety deposit boxes and were currently flipping through stacks of bills that were already on our shelves. They were placing them into two piles: one for 'real,' and one for 'counterfeit.' At least, that's what I assumed.</p>
<p>"That's all, ma'am," Lewis said, looking up at me. "You can get back to your work. We'll let you know when we need something else."</p>
<p>I tried to avoid his cold gaze. At least Agent Rodriguez had a smile for me. "All right then." I returned back to my office to finish filling out the paperwork for the insurance claim. I didn't quite know how to fill in the "Lost assets" column, though. What a weird case.</p>
<p>Sheriff Denton entered with his normal slow shuffle. "Afternoon, Margaret," he told me. He was nearly 70, but the town kept electing him Sheriff as kind of a thank you for all his past service. There wasn't much crime here anyway, and his deputies were all young and fit so no one really saw the harm.</p>
<p>"Sheriff," I nodded to him. "How are you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, fine," he said with a child-like grin. "Back to collect some more evidence. Not every day that we get a bank robbery around these parts! Exciting, isn't it?"</p>
<p>I shrugged. I found it rather terrifying, but then again it was my bank. "If you're here to help with the investigation, the two FBI agents are in the vault doing their investigation now." I leaned in close and whispered, though there was no real reason to given that the bank was empty. "Get this, Sheriff: they think the bills were <em>counterfeit</em>."</p>
<p>Sheriff Denton seemed puzzled. "We... haven't called the FBI..." he told me slowly.</p>
<hr />
<p>The vault was empty. The handtruck with the pallet of counterfeit bills had disappeared, as had the pallets of <em>actual</em> bills, along with a good number of the safety deposit boxes and the list of their owners' names and addresses. The only sign that the Rodriguez and Lewis had ever been there was twin sets of footprints in the dust and rubble leading into the dark tunnel.</p>

<p>Looking down at my Timberlands I realize I'm standing a pool of her still-warm blood. I crouch down and dip the tip of my forefinger in, swirling it around a little. Tiny bits of grass and dirt from the frozen field we stand in mix and spin around on the surface. Dipping and falling into the tiny whirlpool I created. </p>
<p>I raise my hand towards my face, the blood's scent tickling my olfactory. The compulsion to taste it is so strong I can't stop myself. </p>
<p>Blood is blood is blood. The taste is much like my own.  Although there are some slight differences that I can't quite put my finger on. </p>

<h4>[WP] Thor is sitting at a diner finishing a meal. A waitress comes by and casually picks up Mjolnir to wipe off the table.</h4>
<p>Score: 1923</p>
<p>"Brother, I do not see why you bother with these mortal establishments." Loki whispered in a disdainful voice. "We could be feasting in the halls of our father with endless servants loading our plates with freshly roasted boar. Rather than these... what are these?"</p>
<p>"They are called pancakes. I'm quite fond of them, here try this." Thor reached over and grasped the syrup and poured it over the circular cakes, filling the edges of the plate and dripping over the side.</p>
<p>Loki narrowed his eyes in suspicion. "Go on. Try it. Does the god of tricks fear being tricked?" Loki took his fork and stabbed into the pancake, cut off a small perfect square and ate only a single bite. He crewed, examining the flavor and texture in his mouth.</p>
<p>He did not communicate pleasure, but he ate the rest of the square and began eating the rest of the meal. Thor had brought Loki to so many little inconspicuous ventures that the humans had. This was Thor's part in Loki's rehabilitation. Odin had ordered Loki to go and find what made the humans froth forward to the joys of life. Thor was there just to make sure he actually experienced something and did not try anything as foolish as escape.</p>
<p>To mortals, they looked like average truckers. Mjolnir sat next to Loki's plate getting syrup spilled under it, the hammer would not allow itself to be contaminated.</p>
<p>The friendly woman who served them came back over. "Hey guys, how're the pancakes?"</p>
<p>"They are delightful, thank you." Thor spoke through a smile.</p>
<p>"They are... acceptable." Loki surprisingly blurted out.</p>
<p>"So, I was wondering is there a con in town?"</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Thor said "What is a con?"</p>
<p>"A con... a convention? I thought you two would be going to one dressed like that."</p>
<p>"Dressed like what?"</p>
<p>"In armor, and all that, you look a bit like that Thor fella. Is that who you are dressed as?"</p>
<p>Loki slowly looked up at the woman. His tricks fooled gods most of the time, but here was a mortal seeing right through one of his most powerful disguises.</p>
<p>While Thor and Loki stared blankly at her in surprise, she looked down at the table and noticed the syrup slowly flowing to the edge and threatening to leap to the ground.</p>
<p>She grabbed her rag, "Oh, so sorry for this mess." She began wiping the table. Loki and Thor met eyes and shook their heads in wonder. The waitress wiped the syrup back to the plate and reached for the hammer to clean under it. Thor instinctively reached out to stop her, but the woman picked it up as if it were nothing and wiped underneath it.</p>
<p>Thor looked up, once again at the woman who smiled back at him.</p>
<p>"Y'all are kind of quiet. But you're welcome."</p>
<p>"And I thank you. Sorry for any rudeness. May I ask, what is your name?"</p>
<p>"Oh." She said, she pointed to her nametag. "The name is Hebe."</p>
<p>"That is an unusual name." Loki said, inspecting this newly interesting woman.</p>
<p>"Its an old greek name. Anyway, hope you guys have fun with whatever you're doing. I got more people to serve."</p>
<p>And with that, she walked away. "See Loki. The mortals aren't always so boring."</p>
<p>"And I was just beginning to find pancakes intriguing."</p>

<p>And as luck would have it, her plans met with a teen</p>
<p>They flew all the way down to the planet, Tatooine! </p>
<p>When Luke picked them up, he had no way to tell</p>

<p>Score: 1898</p>
<p>"Two words," Congressman Richards said slowly and emphatically, never breaking eye contact with Congressman Powell, the committee chairman. "<em>Chainsaw fingers.</em>"</p>
<p>"Oh, fuck yeah!" Powell answered, scribbling more onto the whiteboard in the center of the hearing room that I'd brought to outline my plan. The pages with my detailed schematics had been torn down and thrown onto the floor, and a rough sketch of a humanoid robot had taken its place. Powell even took the time to add "BRRRR" comment bubbles next to the crude depictions of chainsaws. </p>
<p>"No, no," Congresswoman Pearson butted in. "<em>Laser</em> chainsaw fingers!"</p>
<p>"That doesn't even make sense!" I shouted. No one even heard me. Richards was too busy high-fiving Pearson, and Powell was drawing lasers coming out of each tooth of the chainsaw fingers, complete with "pew pew!" comment bubbles. "Look, if we can just take another glance at my original designs," I pleaded, "I think you'll find it much more feasible, OK? The shore of the Pacific stretches for hundreds of thousands of miles. Even assuming a top speed of a few hundred miles per hour that would allow them to cover long stretches of coastline, the amount of robots we'd need to guard it is <em>astronomical!</em>"</p>
<p>"You're right," Congresswoman Davis addressed me. She'd stayed silent for most of the hearing now, and I had really been counting on her to be the voice of reason in the room. Her home district north of Seattle had been utterly ravaged by a 12-limbed Category 3 (on the Serizawa scale) only six months ago. "You're absolutely right." </p>
<p>"Thank you. Now, if you'll lo..."</p>
<p>"We need <em>MORE</em> robots!" Davis announced loudly to the others. "Like, a hundred times more robots!"</p>
<p>"No!" I cried out. "No, damn it! Not robots! Look, we know that they're all coming from one specific vent in the Pacific, right? Now, the most sensible alterna..."</p>
<p>"How about nunchucks?" Pearson butted in again. "Those are pretty bad-ass!"</p>
<p>"Oh, or throwing stars!" Davis added. "Like, giant ones! Throwing stars bigger than a fucking car!"</p>
<p>"This isn't the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, OK?" I screamed into the microphone. "These are dangerous beasts that have already killed hundreds of thousands of people, and there's another one scheduled to make landfall on Okinawa in less than an hour!" How the hell were we able to get our shit together and create a Pacific-wide sonar system to track a few Soviet subs, but our representatives turned into twelve-year-old anime-obsessed boys when it came down to fighting gigantic hellbeasts? "Now, look. Between the United States, Russia, China, and Europe, there are over 10,000 stockpiled nuclear weapons currently just sitting around. Our early detection systems would allow us to send a nuclear-tipped torpedo within minutes whenever a new Kaiju...."</p>
<p>"Bros, what about flamethrowers?" Congressman Richards interrupted. He hadn't heard a single word I said.</p>
<p>"They fight <em>in water</em>!" I shouted back. "WATER!! And we already tried that in Canberra, remember? Where we burned down most of the city with napalm and it didn't even affect a Category 2???" I was slamming my hand on the polished wooden desk for emphasis, hoping that if even if my <em>words</em> couldn't get their attention, maybe any loud noise would. </p>
<p>There was a stunned silence in the room for just a moment, and then Congressman Pearson spoke. "Well, yeah... but it would <em>look</em> super cool!" The other representatives all nodded and agreed that it would indeed look awesome. </p>
<p>I threw my hands into the air. "You know what? Fuck it. Why don't we just make a giant flaming chain that will solidify into a massive sword so that we can <em>behead</em> Kaiju?" I spouted off the first absurd thing to come into my mind. </p>
<p>There was another stunned silence. "That... would be... <em>AWESOME!</em>" Davis finally shouted. Powell was already jumping around the room, pretending to be slicing at invisible Kaiju with his sharpie as a sword. </p>
<p>I got up from my chair and began collecting my carefully-drawn plans from the floor as they turned towards debating what to name the robots. Congresswoman Davis proposed "Killerbots," while Congressman Richards favored "Murder Machines."</p>
<p>The door flew open, and another dumbass Congressman in a black suit with a flag lapel pin strolled in with a bottle in hand. "Sorry I missed the meeting, bros! I was getting a bit <em>tipsay!</em>" He waved the bottle around illustratively. "Anyone want some Jäger??"</p>

<h4>[eu] ...And it was at that moment that Stirling Archer realised this was the wrong ISIS.</h4>
<p>Score: 1894</p>
<p>"Listen guys," Archer said to his captors.  "I think we can both agree that this was a pretty understandable mix-up.  When I heard there was an ISIS safe house nearby, I thought-"</p>
<p>One of the terrorists jammed the barrel of his AK-47 in Archer's face, held out a phone, and gave instructions in Arabic.  </p>
<p>"Uh.... sorry," Archer said.  "I don't-"</p>
<p>"Speak Arabic," Lana interrupted.  "Because you completely blew off the 8 week Arabic course that all ISIS members are required to take."</p>
<p>"I don't think they need to take an Arabic course, Lana.  They already speak it."</p>
<p>"Not this ISIS, dumbass.  Our ISIS!  The spy agency!  Not the terrorists, to who you've delivered us."</p>
<p>"One," Archer said, holding up a finger.  "ISIS safehouse can mean a lot of different things.  Two," he said holding up another finger, "I'm having a hard enough time thinking straight because it's impossible to find a drink in this part of the world.  And three, whom."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Whom.  The terrorists to whom I've delivered us.  You said it wrong."</p>
<p>"Archer, I-"</p>
<p>The ISIS member interrupted Lana by shouting and waving the phone.</p>
<p>"He wants you to call ISIS."</p>
<p>"But we're already-"</p>
<p>"Our ISIS!  We're being ransomed."</p>
<p>"God, Mother is not going to like this."  Archer dialed, but nobody answered.  A moment later, the phone rang on its own.</p>
<p>"What am I paying you for if you can't even answer a phone?!" Mallorie screamed on the other end as Archer answered.</p>
<p>In the background, they could hear Cheryl yelling back, "I thought I had put it on speaker!"</p>
<p>"Oh, thank God," Archer said.  "Lana and I are being held hostage by ISIS.  And no, it's not our ISIS.  It's the other ISIS.  The one that probably stands for... um... Irritating Shitheads In.... Syria... or something."</p>
<p>"Good one," Lana said, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>"Shut up.  Anyway, we're probably going to need a couple million dollars.  Or so."</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence on the other end of the phone.  Finally, Mallorie said, "Sterling, if this is another one of your voicemail pranks..."</p>
<p>"For God sake, Mother.  It isn't.  Jesus, you leave eighteen different elaborate voicemail pranks and it's like people don't trust you anymore."</p>
<p>"Is that Archer?" Cheryl's voice came through the phone.</p>
<p>"Hang up the phone!" Mallorie said.</p>
<p>"Is he asking for a couple million dollars after he did two hundred thousand dollars worth of damage to my mansion?"</p>
<p>"One," Archer said, "that was mostly Babu.  Two, how many times do I have to apologize for that."</p>
<p>"Once would be nice!" Cheryl said.</p>
<p>"Where are you?" Mallorie asked.</p>
<p>"Outside your office," Cheryl said.</p>
<p>"Not you!  Where are Archer and Lana?"</p>
<p>"With ISIS," Archer said.</p>
<p>"No, we're the ones at ISIS headquarters," Cheryl said.</p>
<p>"For God sake, get off the line!" Mallorie shouted.  Cheryl sighed and hung up.</p>
<p>"Mallorie," Lana said.  "We were on the Malian-Nigerian border when we got captured.  Because your dumbass son doesn't exercise caution when he's in a part of the world where Islamic fundamentalism is on the rise."</p>
<p>"Niger, please." Sterling said.</p>
<p>"What?!" Lana demanded.</p>
<p>"No, I said, Niger as in the country.  And please as in, 'oh please, there's no way this place is full of Islamic fundamentalists.'"</p>
<p>The terrorist stepped forward, jabbing Archer with his weapon again.</p>
<p>"Look!" Archer yelled.  "I've gone too damn long without a drink.  So if you don't relax, I'm about to make a sequel to Terms of Enrampagement!  That's right!  Terms of Enrampagement 2!  Electric Rampagealoo!  That's all going to you!"</p>
<p>"To who?  Me or him?" Lana asked, pointing at the terrorist.</p>
<p>"For the last goddamn time, Lana!  It's whom!" </p>
<p>As he shouted "whom," Archer stole the AK 47 from the terrorist and mowed down the captors.  With the terrorists dead on the ground, Archer took a few deep breaths as smoke creeped out of his gun barrel. </p>
<p>"Whom is still alive?" Cheryl asked through the phone.</p>

<h4>[WP] The Earth is flat, you, as the head of NASA, have to explain to the incoming President why its a secret.</h4>
<p>Score: 1870</p>
<p>"Wait wait wait. Wait." The president rubbed his fingers along his brow, breaking out into a cold sweat. "You're telling me it's an actual flat, fall off the side of the map and  into the abyss type deal?" </p>
<p>"Oh no, It's quite hard to fall off the side of the Earth, Mr.President." Charlie Bolden smiled, giving a shrug. "That would be indicative of a one sided planet, which is quite rare. No, our Earth has two sides. That's why we get to experience night." </p>
<p>It was traditional for the head of NASA to explain the workings of the cosmos to the incoming president. As Charlie Bolden had been appointed during Obama's administration, it was his first time preforming the secret duty. To his credit, though, he was explaining the situation admirably. </p>
<p>Incoming President O'Malley leaned back against his chair, looking over the oval office. He could almost hear the world laughing at him. He thought he lucked out when Sanders vanished and Hill-dog lost it and literally tore Trump's throat out. At that point, he had won the presidency by default. The difficulties of the job started piling into his lap. </p>
<p>"So, where does the world, uh, split? The equator, right?" </p>
<p>Boden was impressed. He nodded. "Yes, actually. Right along the hemispheres. This is why the northern hemisphere experiences winter while the southern experiences summer."</p>
<p>O'Malley nodded, and swallowed loudly. "And why do we keep it a secret?" </p>
<p>The acting administrator smiled wide; his feet carrying him to the globe in the center of the Oval Office. He spun it idly. "Well, sir, why don't you come over here and I'll explain it."</p>
<p>The president of the united states nodded solemnly and made his way to the globe. His eyes lit up as Bolden pressed his fingers against two very specific locations in the North American continent. His thumb pressed against Dallas, and his index found it's way to a small crevice representing the grand canyon. There was a subtle click, and smoke began pouring out of the equator. </p>
<p>"Mother of God." O'Malley whispered, watching the scene unfold.</p>
<p>The President of the United States saw something move in Charlie's eyes. Something was behind him.</p>
<p>"Surprise, Cockbag!" </p>
<p>He turned, and George W. Bush punched him in the face. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama burst from behind the curtains and highfived. </p>
<p>"Suck it, freshman!" They yelled, in unison.</p>
<p>O'Malley fell backwards into the globe and groaned, his head spinning. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Jimmy Carter waddling forward. He was wielding a black sharpie in one shaky, humanitarian hand. He could feel the slick ink spell out the words "Shitlord" on his forehead. </p>
<p>George Bush Senior walked out from a false floor, the one the secret service had been told to use only in emergencies, with a bottle of tequila. </p>
<p>Everyone (except for the current Potus) began yelling "USA, USA, USA!" and highfiving the Administrator of NASA.</p>
<p>Clinton took a selfie. #NoWife.</p>

<h4>[WP] The zombie apocalypse breaks out. You remain safe in isolation for 30+ years. Someone finds you and informs you the zombie apocalypse ended 20 years ago.</h4>
<p>Score: 1869</p>
<p>I went about my usual routine, deep below the ground in my cold war era bunker.<br />
Technically it wasn't mine; it had belonged to some billionaire and I'd read about it in a Time magazine years ago. In the chaos of the Outbreak, I made my way there and had planned to beg entry, offering my services as an electrician and all-round handyman.<br />
Well, that hadn't been needed in the end; their bodies sat in the back of the subterranean wine cellar, mummifying in the still air down there.<br />
The TV hadn't picked up a signal in 30 years but I still liked to sit in front of it; powered still by the miniature hydroelectric plant in the catacombs beyond the cellar. The flickering static and the gentle hissing noises through the old speakers were compelling and comforting.<br />
My steps echoed down the empty, opulent corridors of the richly appointed apocalypse shelter. Dust lay thick everywhere that I didn't walk. Who had time for cleaning? Besides, there were dozens of rooms, along with the driving range and the swimming pool - both fallen into decay. Only frogs and algae lived in the stagnant waters now.<br />
The library was one of my other haunts. Weak electric light flickered behind the stained glass windows, giving the impression of a dying sunset - or the flames of the apocalypse. I had never decided which.<br />
Like the TV though, the light offered comfort and I often found myself drawn here.<br />
Pictures of the rich family still littered the bunker. John and Sarah, oil barons from Texas or somesuch. I couldn't really remember. I paused in front of a dusty mirror, startled by my own reflection - just as I had been thousands of times before - then realised my mistake and wandered on.<br />
I had no idea how long it had been now; time really had lost all meaning to me in my palatial exile. It could have been ten years, it could have been two. It could have been forty.<br />
Only one room was really 'my' room. At first I'd moved between them, but this one seemed like it was <em>mine</em>. I guess it reminded me of my childhood bedroom; the zoetrope constantly casting fanciful shadows around the spaceship wallpaper and the bunkbeds speaking of simpler times.<br />
One of the resident rats scuttled out and attempted to nip me but I carelessly put my foot down; breaking its spine and leaving it paralysed.<br />
A sound echoed down the corridor and caught my attention.<br />
<em>What was that?</em><br />
Turning, I ignored the twitching rodent and made for the stairs to the upper levels.<br />
There is was again. A definite sound - a <em>new</em> sound.<br />
Hurrying now, I stumbled up the stairs in my haste, reaching the landing as I heard more alien sounds.<br />
<em>Voices?</em><br />
Yes, voices!<br />
How long had it been since I'd heard voices? I didn't know.<br />
My own vocal cords worked to respond but it had been too long since they had been used.<br />
<em>"Footprints!</em> There's someone down here!" yelled an excited voice.<br />
Another responded,<br />
"Shit, <em>thirty years</em> someone's been down here?" came a reply - a woman's voice.<br />
"Yeah, some poor bastard has been here twenty years longer than they needed."<br />
I hurried towards the laughter and the light of their electric torches. <br />
Then they were in front of me, shocked by my sudden appearance.<br />
<em>"Holy shi-"</em> started the woman, but was cut off as I gouged open her throat with my exposed jaws.<br />
The man went next; his face raked open with my skeletal fingertips, blinded. The last tried to run but I lashed out and snagged his hip, tearing open cloth and flesh, slowing him down considerably.<br />
As he hobbled frantically away from me, yelling in terror, my new family member rose behind me, her half-severed head lolling to one side.<br />
I grinned in bloody, mummified joy.<br />
My isolation was over.</p>

<h4>[WP] No one in the galaxy ever assumed that Earth would amount to anything because of its extreme gravity for a life-bearing world - anything trying to escape the planet's gravity well would need to BE 97% fuel weight, and the idea that they would try was a ludicrous concept.</h4>
<p>Score: 1862</p>
<p>"Good for them," Zolforat commented as they observed humans farming the cradle of civilization. "Tools and agriculture? Why, they're looking positively sentient."</p>
<p>"Real moxy," Mefro, Zolforat's companion, agreed. "I can hardly understand how they manage to stand up like that!" It stamped its twelve hooves in emphasis. "And in <em>that</em> gravity? They're lucky to be more than a foot tall!"</p>
<p>Zolforat put the ship back into gear. "Real shame about them. If they ever had a chance to develop beyond simple tools, they might be quite interesting to meet." They zipped off toward their final destination and forgot about the rapidly-spinning blue planet in almost no time.</p>
<hr />
<p>"I say, <em>those</em> are the humans?" Zolforat gasped on the way toward refueling in the atmosphere of one of Jupiter's moons. Down on the surface, they observed a city of over a million right in the center of an oddly shaped peninsula. Boats of wood sailed the seas, and stone roads criss-crossed the continent. "Well I'll be damned! They developed this much in just a few thousand orbits?? Why, look at all that!"</p>
<p>"Stone buildings!" Mefro whispered, awestruck. "In <em>that</em> gravity? Can you imagine?"</p>
<p>Zolforat was astounded. "I know! But cheers to them for making it this far! Glad we got to see them at their peak!"</p>
<hr />
<p>"What in the... Mefro, you've got to see what they've done now!" The two had made quite the hobby of watching the poor backwards humans. It was inspiring, watching them try their hardest. But also depressing, knowing that they were trapped on that little rock for the rest of time. "They're using <em>steam</em> for power!"</p>
<p>Mefro seemed impressed. "Clever little devils! I kind of almost want to see them try to make it to orbit."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't say that," Zolforat chided his companion. "There isn't enough water on the planet to produce enough steam to make it into orbit. They wouldn't even hit the second atmosphere layer before plummeting back down. Poor little guys."</p>
<p>"I know," Mefro said. "You're right; I shouldn't have said that. I'm just proud of them for making it this far." The two had developed almost <em>paternal</em> feelings for the poor little human buggers. </p>
<p>"Farewell, humans!" Zolforat told them as the two went off on their way again. "What do you think, Mefro: will they have discovered electricity by the time we return?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Their ship hovered over the burnt remains of a city on an island in the little blue planet's largest ocean. Scanners confirmed what the two already feared: radioactive fallout. This had been a <em>nuclear</em> detonation. Surveillance video from the drone they'd left in orbit showed another chilling discovery: long-range rockets traveling a distance of over 200 miles, packed with explosives. It should have been impossible with that level of gravity, but the damned humans had done it. With just a little more power, one of those could break orbit! On the surface, <em>millions</em> upon <em>millions</em> of humans teemed on every continent, in unimaginable numbers. And it was getting more and more crowded by the second. </p>
<p>"Uh...." Zolforat finally managed to take four of his eyes off of the screen to look back at Mefro. "We... uh... we should probably tell someone about this."</p>

<h4>[WP] Among Alien species humans are famous for prefering pacifism but being the most dangerous species when they are forced to fight.</h4>
<p>Score: 1853</p>
<p>From the personal journal of Astro-chronicler Des Variin.</p>
<p>Humans.  Reviled, worshiped, misunderstood, underestimated.  I first encountered these curious beings some 100 standard years ago, and have yet to fully understand all that makes them so damndibly different from all the other galactic races.</p>
<p>They follow the celestial standard, being bipedal with large brains and being more or less symmetrical, and possessing an organized community.  Humans are curious, nearly to a fault, much like the All'tarr.  They desire to understand the hows and whys of nearly everything they encounter that is different from their normal.  Sometimes this backfires, but usually makes for exceptional leaps in technological advancement far in excess of their time past First Star Exploration (an anthropoligically understood time standard).  They are as advanced technologically, at FSE 125, as other species are at FSE's upwards of 400.  </p>
<p>Humans have, comparatively, short lives but fast reproductive cycles.  This has several effects on their psyche, I theorize.  Their relative fast reproductive rate makes the loss of individuals easier to deal with, so their curious nature that at times gets them into trouble is buffered.</p>
<p>They are, however, aware of their mortality, and so tend to be some of the more pacifistic beings in the galaxy.  Fearing the loss of Human lives, and by extension the lives of others.  They live passionately, love completely, and trust unconditionally.  Usually.  Their short lives means that often times, they live in the moment, but this more often than not means they respect life more than other long lived races that sometimes take their incredibly long lives for granted.  They have been known to broker deals between warring parties and fostering fledgling races when they are found, instead of pacifying them with violence.</p>
<p>Yet, to consider the humans to be pure pacifists, as the Aldarri, would be a heinous mistake.  Their relatively difficult evolution has carefully honed even the most average Human into an organism capable of enduring and inflicting great violence.</p>
<p>For the average Galactic Citizen, when struck in the abdomen with a blaster bolt unprotected, the shock to the neuro system is so severe that death is three to six seconds away.  Humans have been known to survive for as long as eighty minutes, fighting with lethal ability for the first fourteen.  </p>
<p>They are rational and compassionate, but in a stressful situation, a strange evolutionary mechanism manifests, called the fight or flight condition.  Humans possess a gland, that in times of extreme stress, excretes a combat drug.  This drug dulls pain, slows blood loss, and allows for extreme physical performance.  Last year, a settler on Innova-G lifted a 1000 Kg shipping container that had fallen onto her child at their farmstead and rescued the child.</p>
<p>They also have been noted to have an impressive ability to continue to fight after taking damage.  Fighters in their combat sports often continue to mount effective defenses even after taking devastating strikes to their brain cases.  Other fighters have been observed allowing an opponent to dislocate joints rather than forfeit the fight, often continuing to fight until the official stops the match.  There are countless images in the medical files of humans impaled with objects that would have killed 87% of Galactic Council Species.</p>
<p>In Standard Calendar 8327, the Vall discovered the extreme of the Human's fighting capacity when they launched an offensive against 60% of the Human held worlds.  The Humans were only known to the Galactic Councel for 12 Standard years, and thought by all to be pacifists, because of the several successful treaties they brokered in their earliest years.  The Vall wanted the heavy metals known to exist in the Human home solar system's asteroid belt and launched a campaign despite several rounds of negotiations.  Ultimately, this was felt by the humans as a direct attack against the Human Home world, and Humans as a whole.</p>
<p>Today, there is no Vall Home world, and only 20% of the Vall continue to exist.  The Humans have a saying where they "Make an Example" of someone.  The Vall is that someone.  The Vall are currently the Human's most fervent allies.  they learned the hard way about the human's darker side.</p>
<p>The Humans are known as the best friend you could have, and the worst enemy.  The Vall have seen both.  I have been blessed to only have been their friend.</p>
<p>edited a word or two so far.</p>

<p>Fossils are a conspiracy. A false idol planted by the Devil to trick us. Carbon dating is just bad science, and no match for the divine power of miracles and the holy spirit. These are self-evident truths.</p>
<p>And yet, here I am. Despite having the Lord's guidance to demonstrate that the rules of "science" are nothing more than his gentle hand guiding us, despite stretching the boundaries of Einstein's "theories", I do not stand at the start of the universe. I do not stand on the sixth day, watching Adam and Eve in the garden. I don't even stand <em>in a garden</em>. It's more like a... sort of scrubby desert.</p>
<p>A scrubby desert populated by tribes with sticks and basic tools.</p>
<p>And so I am astonished. Dumbfounded. </p>
<p>The Lord has chosen to punish me for my vanity. Obviously this "time travel device" is nothing of the sort. It's just some kind of teleporter that's taken me to... I don't know. Some backward country that isn't Americanized yet.</p>
<p>Lord, you have denied me the sight of the beginning of the universe. And I, your servant, have been chastened. If you see it in your grace to return me to 'Merica, I promise I'll destroy this false device and never think myself worthy of touching your face again.</p>
<p>Bless you, Lord. And bless the United States of America.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add a comment for fairness here. A lot of people have criticised this post for aiming at low hanging fruit or consisting of cliched, pandering-to-the-crowds stuff.</p>
<p>They are right. It's <em>entirely</em> a cheap shot. It's a cheap shot at religion, at the Christian right of American politics, and of people who stick to erroneous beliefs in the face of absolute proof. It was never meant to be much more. It took me 5-10 minutes to write on a boring afternoon, and it brought a smirk to my face. It's a cheap, lazy characature with very little style or substance that ticks a load of preconceived boxes.</p>
<p>I don't apologise for that. That would be the same as apologising for sometimes watching bad TV, or popping to MacDonalds instead of cooking a proper meal.</p>
<p>If you don't like it, that's fine. You are entitled to your opinion, but don't mistake this for my effort at the next War and Peace. I write because I enjoy it, and I hope others enjoy it. That's my sole motivation.</p>
<p>It's just <em>satire</em>. And I thank everyone who got that; I'm glad you enjoyed it.</p>

<h4>[WP] Superman is mentally handicapped. That's why he thinks nobody can pick up the Clark Kent=Superman thing, and everyone plays along in an effort to keep him from throwing a tantrum. The comics are his idea of what is going on. What does a day in Metropolis actually look like?</h4>
<p>Score: 1842</p>
<p>The man in the phone booth was nearly naked, except for a pair of tighty whities. Through the glass, Dave could clearly see the faded stains on his underwear as the poor guy struggled to put on a tight blue shirt. Unfortunately, phone booths are pretty damn cramped, and it was slow going. He'd been in there for nearly 20 minutes now banging his elbows on the walls, and hadn't even started on his pants yet. </p>
<p>"Really sorry about this," the woman standing near the door told Dave. She had a very pretty, but regretful, smile. "I'm afraid this booth is going to be in use for a while. Maybe you want to use the one down the block?"</p>
<p>Dave rolled his eyes. "I'm expecting a call on this one. Why is he getting dressed in <em>a phone booth</em>?"</p>
<p>"It's... a long story," she said. "I'm his nurse, Lois. Clark here has some pretty severe mental difficulties. In his mind, this is really just taking a split second. And it's so urgent that he doesn't have time to go anywhere else to go change." She gave a short bark of laughter, a mix of sadness and mirth. "Well, even though he has super speed and could get to his apartment in the blink of an eye."</p>
<p>Dave peered through the glass; the man's head was stuck inside the tight blue fabric. "What's he changing into, anyway? Why not just leave his suit on?" The jacket, pants, and white shirt were all crumpled on the dirty floor of the booth. </p>
<p>"It's his secret identity," she said. She held up a copy of today's paper. But instead of the headline about Kennedy's blockade of Cuba, it instead showed a doctored photo of that same man 'flying' over a sandy tropical beach with what looked like an ICBM in hand. The headline read: <strong>Superman kicks Khrushchev and his missiles out of Cuba!</strong> "He thinks he's a superhero," Lois explained. "Thinks he can fly, has super strength... all sorts of powers, really. I have a hard time keeping track of them all, to be honest."</p>
<p>Dave studied the fake newspaper. It was <em>really</em> well done. "Where'd you get this?" he asked her.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Kent has a special edition of the Planet printed every day. Being the owner of the paper gets you some pretty nice perks. Ever since he moved from Kansas to be CEO, he's employed me and Clark here as 'reporters' and lets us go chase 'stories' all day about crime lords. Even hires actors and such to 'fight' his son." She smiled. "Mr. Kent's really a sweet guy. It's touching to see how he takes care of his son like this."</p>
<p>Dave didn't seem to think so. "Well, that's nice for him. But it's also kind of preventing me from using the booth." As if on cue, the phone inside began to ring. The man inside had managed to get the shirt on, and Dave could see a big yellow and red "S" on the back. "Why is the 'S' on the front in the photo?" he asked the nurse, pointing to the phony paper. </p>
<p>She glanced over her shoulder. "Oh, damn. Backwards again. I'll have to fix it later."</p>
<p>The phone kept ringing. "Forget it," Dave finally said. The man in the booth hadn't even started on his pants yet. "I'll just go back to my office and try to track down my friend's number." He cast one last glance into the booth, where the man was spinning in circles now. "Good luck with your... superhero friend," he said, voice dripping in sarcasm.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>45 minutes later</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>"Don't worry, Ms. Lane!" 'Superman' said as he emerged from the phone booth. The front of his shirt was a blank blue, and the 'S" was covered up by his cape. "<em>I'll</em> stop Lex Luthor!"</p>
<p>Lois gave an exaggerated gasp and pressed her palms to her cheeks. "My gosh, Superman! Where did <em>you</em> come from??"</p>

<h4>[WP] You applied for a job at google, everything goes well and only one interview remains: They'd just like an explanation for your search history.</h4>
<p>Score: 1835</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Powell," the interviewer adjusted his glasses, "Your references all seem to be in order, and everyone spoke very highly of you."</p>
<p>The last knot in my stomach unraveled. <em>Thank god</em>. I mean, I knew that I would have nothing to worry about. Otherwise, why would I have listed those people as references? But still: it was nice to finally hear. I'd been through days of testing and seen the applicant pool whittled down from two hundred to just three of us left, applying for two spots. </p>
<p>"Just one last thing." He removed a large (like, book-sized) manila folder from his desk and slammed it down in front of me, making the whole desk shake. "Let's discuss your search history." The sentence that <em>every</em> young man fears, though I'd been expecting it to come from my girlfriend, not a potential employer. </p>
<p>"I..." He slid the folder over to me and then tapped his fingers together like Mr. Burns. I extended one finger and flipped the top of the folder open, like there was something disgusting inside that I didn't want to touch. </p>
<p>First page was categorized as "Dangerous." It was a pretty broad term that included things like that time that I'd worked the graveyard shift and decided to learn all I could about the Kennedy Assassination. Then there was the times that I'd googled how to build bombs, propaganda techniques... you know, things that would make me seem like some sort of supervillain or terrorist. "Well this is all..." I stuttered, looking back down at the page as though some explanation might jump out at me. "Look, there's...." I was just curious, I swear!</p>
<p>He cleared his throat and nodded down, asking me to flip to the next bookmark. I turned to the next section, titled "Porn." I don't need to even go into detail, but let's just say that there were some <em>unorthodox</em> searches that would probably send my mother into a coma if she ever read this page. Even reading the searches without seeing the results made me feel like I needed a shower. "I can't be the only one who has looked at..." I glanced back down at the page again. Ok, maybe I was.</p>
<p>"Now, is this really the sort of person we want working at Google?" the interviewer asked.</p>
<p>I bowed my head, and I was just empty inside. I'd gotten so far through the process. It was in my grasp... and now it was slipping away. "Look, it's probably too late to change your mind. But isn't this <em>why</em> we have the internet? So that we can explore curiosity without judgment and get real answers instead of asking someone who doesn't really know either? Should we <em>really</em> be condemning that?"</p>
<p>He snorted. "Oh, <em>that's</em> what you thought the issue was?" He leaned over his desk and tapped the right corner of every page, showing the <em>Bing</em> logo. "We don't care what you're searching for, we just have doubts about your <em>judgment.</em>"</p>
<p>I gave a sigh of relief and closed the folder as fast as possible. I didn't even want to see what other sections were in there. "I was only able to use Internet Explorer from my work computer, and Bing was the default that I couldn't change." I explained through a nervous smile. Hopefully he wouldn't make the connection that all of those searches had been <em>while I was at work</em>. </p>
<p>"Ah!" He slid the folder off the side of his desk, stood up, and shook my hand. "Well in that case, welcome aboard!"</p>

<p>Dagon</p>
<p>By Doctor Murderstein</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37F_NnnkUlM&amp;ab_channel=CyaelDobson">Narrated</a> by the talented /u/cyaelsenpai</p>
<p>My father never introduced me to Dagon until shortly before he died. In retrospect, it wasn't that large of a shock to me. The position of ministry of finance had been vacant for ages, and though I never saw him actually doing the work it was a role my father, and his father before him, had claimed to fill. It was a suspicious state of affairs, with only a few trusted and tight-lipped staff being allowed in the lower levels near the treasury, and absolutely no one but the king allowed to proceed to the inner vault. </p>
<p>The 'inner vault' was a small, mostly empty room towards the back of the treasury. It contained all the highest valuables of the Kingdom, mostly irreplaceable and intricate trinkets and gems that didn't actually take up that much room. The first time my father ever let me in the room with him it wasn't to show me any of this, though. In the back of this room filled with all the smallest and most ornate things in the kingdom was a small and beat up crate, the kind one might find in the kitchens. In that crate, was Dagon. It was when I laid eyes on him that father told me he was the most valuable thing to us in all the kingdom; that we and our people had prospered and been well fed and had a well-funded military for centuries because of Dagon's sole efforts.</p>
<p>He was pathetic. The wyrm's skin was gray and splotchy. His wings were shriveled, though functional with some effort, and one of his front legs had never healed right after an encounter with a rat trap, he would tell me later. He lay still, almost lifeless in his crate on a pile of gold and silver coins, some of which had obviously made up his bedding since the time of my great-great grandfather. Upon stirring I learned one of his eyes was milky white, but despite all appearances his voice was as strong as any man's and he spoke with the eloquence of an era gone by. He and my father spoke like old friends, and meeting me seemed to distress Dagon somewhat as he knew it meant my father's time was short.</p>
<p>He loved my father, fanatically so. At the end of the night when introductions had been made, and once I'd been briefed by my father and Dagon both, my father had sent me away to talk to Dagon alone. I'd turned as I left the vault, and watched as Dagon had flown to my father's shoulder, where he was well-received. From his spot on my father's shoulder the tiny dragon gripped my father's lapels, and leaned his head against my father's.</p>
<p>"Oh, Majesty," the little dragon had said, and as if to say it was alright my father had reached up and comforted Dagon the way one might a cat.</p>
<p>"It's the way of things, Dagon," the old king had told him. He took a few coins from his pocket and put them in the crate. "These are the last coins struck under my reign. The last ones with my face on them. I'll be gone soon, and wanted you to have these." </p>
<p>A few nights later, when my father had passed, I found Dagon uneasily rearranging his coins. A quirk of his dragon nature wouldn't let him sleep and he was up most of the night restlessly rearranging them, shifting uneasily from coins my father looked young on and the ones he'd given him most recently. </p>
<p>This was all years ago. Just as he had for my father before me Dagon proved to be the most wise and trustworthy council. I'd consulted him in times of war and famine, and he'd taken care of my kingdom. There were nights Dagon was sick and I'd stay in the inner vault all night, letting him sleep in my bejeweled crown, turned upside down on a table and filled with his favorite coins, which seemed to reinvigorate him. Sometimes he would leave the vault and join me, hiding in the folds of robes to whisper secrets in my ear when his wisdom and counsel was needed outside the vault. </p>
<p>Tonight I'm heading to see Dagon like I have so many times before. I walked the route I'd taken countless times like my fathers had, through halls and doorways that had seen countless kings come and go. It took me longer than it used to, and some of the doors seemed to only grow heavier over the years. I passed the guards of the treasury, members of my own personal security detail who could be trusted not to harm Dagon even if they did discover him. Telling them I might be a while I closed the door of the outer vault behind me and proceeded towards the interior. When I had closed the interior vault door Dagon stirred in his crate, and his head rose on his long neck to see above the brim.</p>
<p>"Dagon", I said to him as I placed an aged hand on the young man next to me. "This is my son." </p>
<p>The small dragon trembled terribly. "Oh, Majesty", was his only reply.</p>

<p>"No… No, I don't wanna talk about it."</p>
<p>Freddy rocked back and forth on the couch, rubbing his arms like trying to shake off the cold.</p>
<p>"What happened, Freddy?" Jason asked, trying a hand on Krueger's shoulder. </p>
<p>Krueger shivered, pulling away. "Don't! No touch!"</p>
<p>"Ok, ok… sorry. But you have to talk about –"</p>
<p>"He did things," Freddy mumbled, almost to himself. "He had powers… He made things happen."</p>
<p>"What? What did he make you do, Freddy?"</p>
<p>"No, no! I can't!"</p>
<p>"Freddy, if you don't talk about it, I can't –"</p>
<p>"I was naked at school," Freddy blurted out. "Everyone was watching. And I looked down and – and there was a 
hoodie with bunny ears on my dick, and the girls were laughing, Jason…"</p>
<p>Jason frowned. "What?"</p>
<p>"And when I tried to attack him, the bunny started talking, saying I'm a loser. Screaming 'Look at me, I'm Freddy's loser penis and I'm small!'"</p>
<p>"Wait… the bunny started –"</p>
<p>"DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT THAT HAVING YOUR OWN PENIS TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE A

<p>"But how did he make these things happen?" Jason asked, confused. "I don't under –"</p>
<p>"I don't know! I don't know! After a while I stopped trying to kill him, and just started asking him what the fuck 
was going on!"</p>
<p>"And what did he say?"</p>
<p>Freddy paused. "Nothing," he mumbled, finally. "But my bunny penis told me to go fuck myself."</p>
<p>Jason scratched his head. "That doesn't make any sense, Freddy. How could he be controlling the dream?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, Jason," Freddy said, looking up. "But I'm afraid to fall asleep again. I'm so afraid that… that…"</p>
<p>"Shh, it's fine," Jason whispered, pulling Freddy's face to his shoulder. "It's fine. It's over now…<em>loser</em>."</p>
<p>Freddy's eyes went wide. Slow and terrified, he looked up. Jason had bunny ears sprouting from his hockey mask, a 
creepy look behind his hollow eyes.</p>
<p>"No… no, please, no!"</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Something bothering you, Freddy?" Jason asked, holding Freddy's head just a little tighter to his shoulder. "Cause you can tell me, whatever it is. No matter how <em>small</em> it seems to you."</p>
<p>"No. No, I gotta wake up!" Freddy yelled, trying to break free from Jason's grasp. "I gotta wake up, this is not real! Don't, please, I –"</p>
<p>But even as he spoke he heard the cough.</p>
<p>Slowly, he pulled his eyes down to his crotch.  </p>
<p>His penis was looking up, a look of disapproval behind half-spectacles.</p>
<p>"God, you are such a disappointment, Freddy," the penis said, and Freddy broke into tears once more.</p>
