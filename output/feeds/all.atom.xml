To make their side look more appealing, people present nuanced arguments as black and white, or take extremes and pretend like they are the only options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of thinking often leads to ignoring potential solutions, and prevents us from gaining an accurate understanding of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also leads to polarization of opinions — people treat an argument as a battle against the opposite side, and as a result take more and more extreme positions. Sometimes people are afraid to offer measured opinions because their own side will call them a traitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example a politician may demonize drugs and suggest longer sentences for drug addicts, because taking a more balanced view will make him look like he supports drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other examples of this fallacy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either you are with us or against us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either we improve this law or everyone will suffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either you go to church or you are a bad person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either you are a republican or a democrat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome it, remember that in reality things are rarely one-sided. Most of the time complex issues have costs and benefits. Optimizing for values requires trade offs. To get the most accurate picture, you want to see flaws and advantages of both positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you support one side of the with one group of people, doesn’t mean you have to automatically agree with everything that side says and reject the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Availability Heuristic</title><link href="/post/availability-heuristic" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:09:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/availability-heuristic</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The airplane is speeding up and preparing to take off, and you can’t stop imagining it blowing up or being taken over by terrorists. You sweat and worry during the whole flight. Eventually it lands, and you are finally able to relax, get into the taxi, and drive home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, now the odds of you of dying are 19 times higher, because statistically car accidents are way more common causes of death than airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you get most of your information about disasters from news, and traffic accidents are simply not newsworthy enough to report, so you see way more stories about people dying in airplanes, and start intuitively feeling like they are more likely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We judge how common something is based on how easy it is to remember. Because of that, we overestimate the probability of more recent or more dramatic events, and underestimate the probability of things that are less vivid in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that we make many mistakes, and act irrationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are afraid of snakes and spiders, but keep smoking and eating unhealthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US government spends 2 times more money on fighting terrorism than on fighting cancer, even though cancer has way more victims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People feel that the level of crime keeps rising, even though it’s at all time low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People feel unsuccessful when they compare themselves to rich and famous people, who are way more prominent on tv and media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If media would report on people who lost their money playing lottery as much as it talks about winners, there would be less people playing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also significantly underestimate the probability of things that haven’t happened yet, but are likely to happen in the future. If natural disasters haven’t happened in your town in the past ten years, you are much less likely to take them seriously and take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To correct these errors, we need to study statistics and rely on data instead of our intuitions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Expected Utility</title><link href="/post/expected-utility" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/expected-utility</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine I offer you a gamble. I will spin the wheel that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/expected-value-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you win the amount of money that it will choose. If it hits a negative number you owe me that much. Should you play or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of problem you are solving every time you are trying to decide whether or not to take any risky action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to figuring out whether the action has a positive or negative value to you, so called Expected Utility, whether it’s benefits outweigh the potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out the answer, you need to know the sum of all the potential benefits multiplied by their probability, and compare it to the benefits and probability of the risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first we estimate probabilities of each outcome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/expected-value-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we calculate our upside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$20&lt;em&gt;0.3 + $15&lt;/em&gt;0.2 + $5*0.2 = $10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the downside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-$10&lt;em&gt;0.2 - $30&lt;/em&gt;0.1 = -$5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we can see that the expected utility of playing this game is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$10 - $5 = $5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know that if you play this game many times, on average, you will be making $5 every game, so that’s a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very useful concept, because when you think like that about every action you take, you end up making much better decisions. You don’t take dumb risks, and you don’t miss great opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, we need to make decisions under uncertainty. When you know your values, and take actions with maximum expected utility, you can take the optimal way towards achieving your goals.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Rationalization</title><link href="/post/rationalization" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:07:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/rationalization</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You see this beautiful girl standing across the room. You would like to approach her and start a conversation, but then you think to yourself “Nah, she probably has a boyfriend. Also she wouldn’t like me anyway. Not to mention that I need to focus on studying, I don’t really have time for relationships.” So you look away, go home, play World of Warcraft, eat a pizza, feed your cats, hump your human-sized action figure of Chewbacca, go to sleep, and die alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were your excuses the actual reasons for not approaching? Imagine if you’d know with 100% certainty that you will not get rejected, would you still decide that you’d rather focus on studying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationalization means coming up with seemingly logical/rational explanations for irrational behavior. We do whatever feels good, or whatever is easy/convenient/profitable, and then come up with explanations that make us feel better about our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to buy a new car. You don’t know much about the recent models, so you research, select a few options, look at their specs, make the list of pros and cons of each one. At the bottom the list, you finally write down your decison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say you’re a salesman, and your job is to sell a certain model. You take a sheet of paper, and at the bottom you write “and that’s is why this is the best car ever”. Then you do your research, compare options, and above the bottom line, you write a list of reasons why that’s the best model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not lying, all the reasons are true, but you started thinking about them after the choice has already been determined. Your answer was already either true or false before you came up with explanations, and they_could not change your choice_. Your actual reason for making it was “that’s my job to sell this car”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to make a choice or belief rational even by using the smartest, most convincing arguments. The purpose of rationality is not to argue convincingly for a position, but to decide which position to argue for. Once your position is fixed, it can not become more rational. Rationality takes evidence and knowledge and looks for the best, most accurate conclusions. Rationalization runs in reverse, it starts with the conclusion and searches for reasons. If you already know your answer — thinking about it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your success is determined by how good your decisions are, and when you are rationalizing, the actual algorithm you are using to make decisions is “whatever feels good”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you defeat rationalization? First of all, it comes down to being aware of it, and being honest with yourself. Always ask — what are theactual reasons for my beliefs/decisions/actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you eating this ice cream because “well, it has nuts in it, so it’s actually kinda healthy” or because it tastes good?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you playing this computer game because “life is to be enjoyed”, and this game actually brings you joy? It is the best thing you want to do with your life right now, or just the easiest?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you skip gym this time because it’s the best day to take a break and let your body rest and restore, or because it’s raining outside?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that you didn’t get that job, it doesn’t seem that great, is it because didn’t actually want it anyway?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And be suspicious when your explanations conveniently happen to give you the permission to do the thing you wanted to do before coming up with them, or make you feel better about doing/believing things that you like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do keep your religion because it’s a “good moral guidance”, because it makes sense, or because your parents believed in it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you defending piracy because “it actually helps companies to promote their content, so it’s not a big deal, also information should be free”, or because it’s really convenient to watch a free movie?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your city or country actually the best place in the world, or do you like it because you were born here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also notice that when you are looking for answers that you don’t already know, you feel curious, you are craving to know the answer, yet rationalization usually makes you more confident/comfortable/justified.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Confirmation Bias</title><link href="/post/confirmation-bias" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:04:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/confirmation-bias</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your elbow is itchy, and you are starting to fear that it might be serious. You type in google “itchy elbow, serious symptom”, and in 20 minutes you are convinced that you have elbow cancer, space AIDS, and a severe case of acute ladidadidosis. The more you search, the more certain you are of your impending doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion, you may type “dolphins are racist”, and find out all about dolphins being the secret force behind holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily find a confirmation for any belief, and people often do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to look for information that confirms our beliefs. We jump to conclusions, assume that our initial guess is correct, and then look for evidence that supports it. That is called confirmation bias, and it has many effects that prevent us from being more intelligent and developing accurate beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set higher standards for evidence that disagrees with our ideas. For example, if you don’t believe in evolution, you may say that this is because there’s a gap in the fossils between monkeys and humans, and so there’s not enough evidence to prove that evolution is true. At the same time, you may have no problem taking an old book and the words of a priest as a convncing support for your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When information is ambiguous, we tend to interpret it as supporting our existing position. Lets say someone was rude to you the first time youve met, then the next time he does something nice, you may think that he’s just being manipulative or wants something from you, so you become even more convinced that this is a bad person. On the other hand if the first time you’ve met someone he was nice, and is now he’s acting like a jerk, you may just assume that he’s simply having a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we remember things selectively — facts that prove us right are easier to recall. People who believe in horoscopes, probably do that because they can easily remember all the times horoscopes were right, and forget or ignore countless times they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome confirmation bias, try to balance the sources you get your information from, to look at the both sides of the argument, think about what kind of evidence would disprove your theory, and actively search for things that challenge your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>What are Cognitive Biases?</title><link href="/post/what-are-cognitive-biases" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:03:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/what-are-cognitive-biases</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a basket of fruits(apples and oranges), you reach out, take one at random, and eat it. Then you decide you’re hungry, and eat a few more. At that point you realize that you ate like 5 apples and only one orange, so you think that there’s way more apples in there. Makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you reach into a different basket, and grab a bunch of berries —5 strawberries and 10 blueberries. Should you think that there’s 2 times more blueberries here? Not really, because strawberries are bigger and heavier, so there’s more of them at the bottom of the basket than at the top, and your estimate would be biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called statistical bias. When your information is skewed, you form an inaccurate picture of the world. You could try to gather more data, but it wouldn’t help, because the way you gather it is fundamentally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now imagine you reach into the third basket, and holy shit! — it’s dollar bills! You’re rich, you’ll finally be able to buy your own giraffe, you always wanted one. Then you notice that some of the bills are $100, and other’s are only $5. But you think most of bills in the bag are probably $100, right? I mean you really wish they were, after all, giraffes are expensive, and you don’t want to settle for buying some lame capybara at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case your expectation is incorrect not because you have wrong information, but because it’s influenced by a different kind of bias — acognitive bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our brain does not have the time and energy to accurately process all the information it perceives, it takes mental shortcuts(called heuristics). Most of the time they are useful, but often they mislead us and result in systematic errors in our thinking — that is what cognitive biases are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like statistical biases, cognitive biases distort your picture of the world, and when your method of learning about the world is flawed, gathering more information will not help to correct the error, in fact it can even worsen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These biases prevent us from having accurate beliefs, making good decisions, and achieving our goals. Sometimes they result in small mistakes(like losing some money by playing a lottery), sometimes mistakes are not so small(burning witches, holocaust, me watching Star Wars prequels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive biases are not a result of being an unfair or a dishonest person, they are not committed by choice, they are a fundamental property of how humans think, they are flaws in the lens through which we look at the world. Being biased is like having a miscalibrated measuring instrument, except in this case the instrument is your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we fix it? Instead of relying on our natural hunches and intuitions, we can learn to recognize our mistakes, and then use superior tools(rationality and logic) to correct them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good place to start is to learn about the types of biases, fallacies, and the cognitive tools we can use to prevent them, which is what this series of posts is about.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Light</title><link href="/post/light" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:01:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/light</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no justice in the laws of Nature,&lt;br /&gt;
