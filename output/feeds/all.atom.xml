&lt;p&gt;My goal is to explain how comedy works, and to understand the process of writing jokes.
If I am successful, I will be able to teach a person who has no experience of writing comedy to write jokes at will, whenever he wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything below is my hypothesis about how comedy works, and if it is correct, after reading and understanding this post, you should be able to take a setup, go through a series of steps, and end up writing a joke(s).
&lt;!-- regardless of how good they are, just has to be recognizable as a joke --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background (how mind works)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main function of a brain is to make predictions about the world.
(when you can predict what happens next you are better at survival and reproduction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain makes predictions by learning(memorizing) and then recognizing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Default thinking patterns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think you follow a sequence of familiar, memorized steps, to go from one thought to another.
These are "thinking patterns", I will call them "&lt;strong&gt;lanes&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;What is the last worrd at the end of this _______?
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can naturally fill the last word(sentence) because you have recognized the beginning of a familiar pattern, and can predict what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More examples of patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;A B C D _ F
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(you can predict that the 5th letter is F)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1 2 3 4 _
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Wake up &amp;gt; Drink Coffee &amp;gt; ________
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Dress and Go to work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- More complex, high-level ones: --&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;I see a man in a business suit &amp;gt;?he is probably successfull and competent
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I see a person that looks a cerain way, this is how he is supposed to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;?Example
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This kind of a situation usually have this kind of ouctome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;I see man and woman holding hands &amp;gt; they are probably in love
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I see a certain kind of a situation it usually has this explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of kinds of Lanes&lt;/strong&gt;(thinking patterns):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prediction&lt;/em&gt; a person makes about what will happen,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;his &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt; about the &lt;em&gt;outcome&lt;/em&gt; of this situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or his &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; of what is going on in this situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all of the &lt;em&gt;assumptions&lt;/em&gt; that he makes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;his &lt;em&gt;interpretations&lt;/em&gt; of what's going on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically lanes are the "trails of thought", everything that you consciously "think" about a situation, or unconsciously expect to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
### New ideas and inventions

Examples above were the examples of the "default" lanes.
New ideas are the patterns that nobody has recognized before.

When scientist invent new laws or formulas - they are essentially finding new (unexpected) patterns, and then teaching other people to recognize these patterns.

When writers write fiction, they setup situations and then show the unexpected outcomes.

People value new thinking patterns very much and enjoy learning them&lt;!-- (especially when they are valuable). Similarly people value destroying the wrong patterns(finding mistakes in their thinking).

I have a strong viceral sense that the concepts of curiosity, creativity, and comedy have something very similar with each other. Based on that theory of mind, here are quick definitions of creativity and curiosity:

Creativity is the process of finding/creating the new patterns.

Curiosity is what people experience when they are faced with a question that they can not predict the outcome of. The more valuable it is to predict that outcome the more curious people are.
--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is comedy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comedy happens when:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person realizes that the assumption(based on a default thinking pattern) that he made about a situation was (very)wrong, and as a result he &lt;em&gt;detects mistaken reasoning (that he was not aware of?) and quickly deletes a false version/old-pattern&lt;/em&gt;,
and that's when he laughs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, comedy happens when:
Something &lt;em&gt;break/defeats/shatters&lt;/em&gt; the default &lt;em&gt;thinking pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a person laughs when he recognizes that the lane he took was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wrong, and as a result
&lt;em&gt;his thinking quickly switches to the unexpected, alternative lane&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default lane&lt;/strong&gt; - default thinking pattern, everything that you think/predict/expect/assume/interpret/etc by default.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The 2nd(alternative) lane&lt;/strong&gt; - a new lane that your thinking switches to when you hear the punch-line of the joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To achieve that effect, your goal is to:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To do that you need to&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find an alternative lane(&lt;em&gt;pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome&lt;/em&gt;) that is &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; from the default lane that a person took,
but &lt;em&gt;compatible with the information you have, makes sense in the hindsight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative lane is what turns out to be the true perception of reality, but is very different from what is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wide Gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gap&lt;/em&gt; is, well, a gap between the default lane and an alternative lane. The difference between the default perception of the reality and an alternative one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wider the gap - the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, a good ways to thinnk about the 2nd lane are:
- Crazy alternative
- Very-not-true interpretation
- "Wrong "interpretation
- Over-the-top&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Joke structure.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every joke has a setup and a punch line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; is what creates(sets-up) a "default" lane, and &lt;strong&gt;punch&lt;/strong&gt; is what reveals the 2nd, "alternative" lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connector&lt;/strong&gt; - is the element of a joke that is compatible with both lanes.
It is a thing that can be interpreted in 2 ways, that makes both the default and the alternative lane possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;connection/association/explanation&lt;/em&gt; that is compatible with both lanes, that connects them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of a joke(from a book "Step by Step to Stand up comedy" by Greg Dean):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep.... But the kids on the bus were screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/deep-learning/deep-learning-roadmap.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Joke Structure" src="/images/joke-structure.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"1st Story" in this diagram is the same as the "default lane", and "2nd Story" is the same as the "alternative lane". That's just what writer calls them, I use my own terminology because I think it's better.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this joke, when you hear the &lt;strong&gt;setup&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep....&lt;/em&gt;)
your brain creates a &lt;strong&gt;thinking pattern(assumption, lane)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;you imagine an old man lying peacefully in his bed&lt;/em&gt;, when you hear the &lt;strong&gt;punch-line&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;But the kids on the bus were screaming.&lt;/em&gt;) you immediately switch lanes(&lt;em&gt;image of a bus and a sleeping driver&lt;/em&gt;), you realize that your default interpretation of the reality was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wrong, your brain detects the mistaken pattern, and that's when you laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Another Example:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor's appointment.&lt;br /&gt;
    - I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.&lt;br /&gt;
    - But why?&lt;br /&gt;
    - So I could examine you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default lane&lt;/strong&gt;: Image of a doctor, patient, the doctor gives him advice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alternative lane&lt;/strong&gt;: Image of a dude jerking off in front of the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative lane is &lt;em&gt;compatible with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.&lt;/em&gt; Yet your &lt;em&gt;pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome&lt;/em&gt;
was &lt;em&gt;very wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Importance of the connector&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonsequitir. Just something crazy but not funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Types of connectors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of connectors are similar to the types of lanes you can have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpretation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My opinion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meaning(word/phrase)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;//metaphor  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The main challenge in comedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge in comedy is&lt;br /&gt;
finding that 2nd lane, &lt;em&gt;(very unexpected alternative),&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
that is &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;crazy/very-not-true/wrong/over-the-top/unexpected&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and at the same time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;compatible, makes sense in the hindsight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what makes it hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding an alternative explanation that makes sense is easy, you just list all the possible explanations that make sense. But it will not be funny.(&lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a crazy idea is also easy("I'm afraid that you have to stop masturbating - But why? - because fish live under water". "My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep.... But humans can breathe in space") - but it will be just that, crazy. It will not be funny because it is not connected or associated with a setup in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second lane should be &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; crazy, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; make a lot of sense in retrospect, be a viable explanation for what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding the alternative lane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1 Connectors &amp;gt; Crazy Alternatives&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for things(possible connectors) that have double meanings or 2 alternative explanations/interpretations/etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or - take a situation(setup) and look at all the elements/properties that may have double meanin/nterpretations, and try to find the alternative lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the way that most of the double entendres are made, and most of the jokes based on the words with double meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method seems very simple and straightforward. The downside of this method is that sometimes it's hard to find connectors with 2 lanes from a setup/situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also it is hard to imagine how a lot of high-level jokes or funny stories to be made using this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2 Misdirection.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can phrase a setup in a way that misleads a person into wrong lanes, creates wrong assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this method you basically start with a 2nd lane(the one that the punch line) is based on, and then you come up with a setup that is compatible with it, but strongly suggest a different meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this method is weird and I'm mentioning it just because I think comedians are often using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3 Jump&amp;gt;Move&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is more complex, and requires understanding of some new concepts, but I also think that it is the most interesting and the most universal one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the main reason I am writing this article, I am hoping that it will be possible to create more complex and high-level types of comedy with this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creation of a lot of the most hilarious comedy(xkcd, community) is unlikely to be explained by the first 2 methods, but I think that this one &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be formalizing the thinking process really cool comedians are going through, but are struggling to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest of the article explains the concepts you need to understand to use it and the steps for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jump&amp;gt;Move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea is to&lt;br /&gt;
- start with creating the crazy idea (crazy lane, 3rd lane, not connected lane)&lt;br /&gt;
and /then/&lt;br /&gt;
- find/create a connector and the 2nd lane, in the process of moving??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call these 2 steps "&lt;em&gt;jump&lt;/em&gt;" and "&lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt;".(I explain why use these names later)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come up with a crazy idea first("&lt;em&gt;jump&lt;/em&gt;"), and then find a way to connect it("&lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt;").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jump&lt;/strong&gt; is the step where you create an unconnected &lt;em&gt;crazy idea&lt;/em&gt;, the 3rd lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- **Move** this is where you find a connector, the *crazy association*. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move&lt;/strong&gt; this is where you find a the &lt;em&gt;crazy association&lt;/em&gt;, try find a connection between the "crazy idea" and reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important thing: the 2nd lane is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the same as the "crazy idea". You find the second lane in the process of trying to connect the "crazy idea" with the reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just trying to make crazy idea make sense will not work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2nd lane lies inbetween the "crazy" lane idea and the "default" lane??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This steps connects the 2 lanes, make the "crazy idea" sensible in the hindsight, and that makes a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jump&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal - create&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;crazy/very-not-true/wrong/over-the-top/wide-gap&lt;/em&gt;
crazy alternative.
(comic reality? Looking for crazy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reversal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exaggeration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect to field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perspective (Max angle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straightforward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Move //~crazy association??&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal - create/find crazy/new&lt;br /&gt;
connection/association/reinterpretation/alternative&lt;br /&gt;
by seriously thinking on crazy stuff.&lt;br /&gt;
(Rationally explain the insane thing, and this is how you find a conector??)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive aspect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situation in which it could be useful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// why? how? explain? imagine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//thoughts sparkling through gaps between default and crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shirley/annie - buddy/detectives.
You don't have to find the association, you can make one.
(//with a strong frame)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Example of writing a joke --&gt;

&lt;!-- Request
If anything is confusing or unclear to you - please leave a comment.
If you have any questions - let me know.
Also please take the setups that I've provided, and try writing a joke based on them.
Briefly show me your thinking process, and the resulting jokes.
Tell me what worked and what didn't. What was easy and where you struggled.
If it didn't work for you - let me know.
If you need help at one of the steps or more examples - tell me.
And the success rate, how many of the attempts resulted in a joke.

Also if this post helped you and you are feeling grateful, the best thing you can do(besides leaving feedback) - is to share this post with your friends or on social networks.

&lt;p&gt;Sounds of several gunshots echoed in the abandoned metro station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few bullets blasted the column right above the Max's shoulder as he dived into the space between trash containers to get away from the line of fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He estimated that they had about half a minute, so he got back to vigorously typing in his laptop. "Hey, that's what I call 'agile programming'!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle didn't appreciate the joke. He was hiding behind another column, watching 4 people in expensive suits and with guns in their hands running in their direction. "You've said it will be safe! You've sayed it will be just a simple job!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, the next time we will be more careful"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; time?! You gotta be high to think that I will agree to something like that again!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max just smiled. Typing has slowed down and then stopped with the victorious hit on enter key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now we just give it a minute for it to work. Do you have any idea how do we last a minute without getting shot?"&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[2031-03-11 12:36]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny old house, one of the very few that still left in the center of a big city.
Group of 6 people gathered in the biggest room on the first floor.
All of them looked thoughtful and grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So I take it we're completely screwed, huh?" abscentmindedly mumbled Alice(16 years old, long black hair, very lean) from the couch, without taking eyes off her tablet that was propped against her legs, where she was carefully drawing something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Uh-huh" responded Mike(21 years old, buttoned-up t-shirt with a pocket protector. Seriously.) . He was sitting on the opposite end of the couch, and reading Feynman's lectures on physics(Volume 1) for a 4th time. He was always reading when he was fighting stress. Or not. He was always reading, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How did we manage not to get this one? It was a website for a baking company for ktulhu's-sake!!" asked Amber(22 years old, bulky but comfortable cloth, shuffled red hair), although they all knew perfectly well how "I do not blame Kyle for not pushing on that one, of course" she was sitting on the floor tinkering with wires on the raspberry pi project that she was making. Very, very rarely there was a moment where you could see Amber without a cheerful simle on her face. That was one of thouse moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm telling you, guys, I should've negotiated this project. You all are bored to death with this kind of work, and it shows, I don't really care, so I could've talked them into letting you do the job" Usually relaxed and careless Seth(28 years old, slightly overweight, very hairy and beardy) was playing xbox, but he kept losing the same simple level, his heart wasn't in it. The last part of the sentence rose to the intense scream, as a figure on the screen was firing hell on crowds of aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yiii-ha!!" Max(22, black shuffled hair and short beard, black jeans and shirt with an orange tie, also in glasses - but regular ones, simple black narrow rectangles. Bright and intent brown eyes, with strikingly sharp and saturated, almost orange retinas) looked up from behind his thinkpad x4, happy smile dawning on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What?" Kyle(24, shaved head, goatee, long coat, piercing, intent, intelligent sight from behind his augmented reality glases) was standing in the center of the room, staring intently at Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've got an idea! I've got this friend who..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Uu-ugh..." - from every person in the room. Not again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, hear me out!! This time it's legit... Almost. Well, at least less illegal. And &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; much less dangerous!" they've had this conversation before, but Max was certain that this time he will convince them. They didn't have much of a choice really. He was the only one really excited about a prospect of doing some hacking - he always found it invigorating - but he was pretty sure that all of them will really enjoy that too, eventually. Even though it really didn't seem possible right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Alright, what do you have?" said Kyle, as everybody were staring at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max's simle grew even wider. I knew this time it will work!! As cautious Kyle was, he was clealry more sick of the boring projects than any of them, and he may not like admitting it, but Max remembered very clearly how excited Kyle was on their last and only hack. Despite how that all turned out... Kyle may not think that hacking is very prudent, but this time he will take the interesting and challenging project he was craving for for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have this... acquitance... who says he has a job for us. It won't be like the last time, I promise. It is a small company that doesn't take their security very seriously, and he says that all we need to do is steal some data from them for their competitors. Cmon, let's at least hear what do they have to offer!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fine. Setup a meeting." Kyle's voice was still stern, but his face got noticeably less grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[2031-03-14. 02:36AM]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in the expensive black suit was standing in the middle of the old metro station, looking bemused. Two serious-looking guys in sunglasses(In the metro. At night.) were standing by his sides. "What did you choose this place for?" said the man, a little concerned. "Couldn't we met in starbucks or something?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle and Max looked at each other. From what Max knew about that kind of meetings from movies, he assumed that the old abandoned metro station was the way to go, besides he thought that this could impress 'an owner of a small company, a regular guy' his acquitance said they were supposed to meet. Now he himself was a little nervous, the guys that were standing in front of them were looking more like some low-level thugs. Thakfully, they were looking confused and unthreatening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is more private" said Kyle, assuming the authoritative tone, Max firmly nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So" said Max, "what job do you have for us?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Recently we learned that our, uhm, competitors, got some data about out company. Private data abot our employees mostly, and also some financial and buisiness information that we would like to keep secret. What you will need to do is to find and destroy all the information they have on their servers about our company"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[to be continued....]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The battle was at it's hardest, and they were losing.
Vi was protecting him and Kyle with her force field while Kyle was struggling to keep his portal open while Dash was attempting to throw sleeping bombs at their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team they were fighting against included very powerful supers. One could control the metal, another, Pyro, could manipulate the fire, and finally, they had a telepath and seer. A seer!! How are you supposed to fight against someone who can literally see the future, even if for 8.5 seconds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant that whenever Dash was going to attack - seer would simply send a telepathic command to magnetto, and Dash would face a metal wall on his way, while having to dodge the streams of fire from Pyro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their only hope was to disable or confuse the seer.
And their only advantage was that dash was faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is not to choose a path that leads to victory, but to make sure that all the paths lead to victory - he remembered someone's quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vi!" said Dash, "Create the force field around the seer!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle's portals could not penetrate Vi's shield, there was a chance that seer's powers will not be able to do that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field around them disappeared, immediately reappearing around the seer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes!!" Apparently that was an attack that seer had no way of avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it was up to Dash and Kyle to disable the last 2 opponents, which suddenly became a lot more doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next second, right before the huge stream of fire was about to hit them, Kyle opened a portal, which consumed the fire and spat it out in the direction of magneto, who this time was unable to dodge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the time slowed down and things seemed to become share but more colorless, as Dash used the last burst of his power to run towards Pyro and shoot a stream of stunning rays at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then everything got quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyro was peacefully sleeping in the middle of the battlefield, seer was trapped in the force field, and magnet to was probably teleported into informatory by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We won!!" yelled Dash, as the simulated environment around them faded, slowly turning into the inwards of a sleeping capsule they used to simulate their training battles.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="short-stories"></category><category term="commuity"></category></entry><entry><title>On the ship</title><link href="/post/on-the-ship" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-31T13:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-01-31:post/on-the-ship</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ship was kneeling left and right as the giant waves were hitting it's sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirate Cornelius was in a bad mood, and that had nothing to do with the storm. He was used to dealing with storms. What he was not used to dealing with was….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But according to even the briefest calculations using Bayesian probability, considering the priors available to me, the chances of that happening are infitesimally small!!” said the thin figure in the black pants and t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornelius looked at his crew. "Alright, which one of you idiots is responsible for taking &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;" the gesture to the figure “on our ship!? And why is he not feeding the sharks since 3 hours ago?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, boss, I'm sorry boss, but you've told us to bring a hostage! You've said that it should be someone from the rich family, but this one even better!! This is a magician!!” said Boram-the-giant, a huge muscular man, a great warrior but not a very sharp guy. He was bigger and stronger than Cornelius, but still very afraid of him - he saw what Cornelius did with many others who were bigger and stronger, yet not careful enough around him. Boram had every intention of staying on the captain's advisor good side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MAGICIAN?? What have you done you fools!! What will we do with the magician?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I've heard they are rich, and have all kinds of artifacts…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The point of taking a hostage was to trade him for money or immunity from federation's ships!! What do you think magicians will do when they find out we have one of their own? Give us money? Ha!! They can teleport into this ship or fly here on dragons or send ghosts on our heads!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look of shock and horror was dawning on the faces of everyone who heard that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh no.... But… but.. But what if we throw him overboard now, and nobody will have to know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah? Have you thought about what this one mage can do to us? I saw spells that burned and sank the whole fleets! And what makes you think that magicians don't know that we took him already? They have ways of knowing about each other." said the old one-legged pirate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, for all we know he is just toying with us, waiting for a pleasant moment to burn this ship or turn us into his fateful zombies or worse….” said skinny-Rick. He was not normally a fearful guy, but right now he wished he was very very far away from this ship, he also heard the tales of what magicians could do when they're angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But this is just a kid.” protested Boram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He. Is. A. MAGICIAN!!” yelled Cornelius. “What part of the word ‘magician’ don't you understand? They can cause tornadoes infested by flaming sharks &lt;em&gt;by accident&lt;/em&gt;!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric's head was spinning. Part of him was still hoping that this was an acid flashback, but the rest of him knew that it wasn't.
Just yesterday he was at his university, attending lectures, hanging with friends, working as a junior software developer in a cool startup, and today….. today was this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last normal thing he remembered was waiting for a cab in Palo Alto to take him to Stanford, when he thought that he saw a glimpse of a weird hooded figure(?). And the next moment, in a brief purple flash, he was standing under the rain, in the middle what seemed like an old town, illuminated only by a full bright moon peering from behind the clouds, and by fire, that was coming from a few burning buildings around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He remembered seeing 3 men with knives and old(?) guns running towards him. And after what seemed like a few minutes of chaos and running and chaos, he regained his consciousness on a wet wooden floor of a cabin. It was immediately obvious that he was on a ship, with all the /?ship equipment? laying around him and hanging off the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he was peeking through the door(which was unlocked), it suddenly jerked open, and the next moment he was dragged outside, and surrounded by a group of terrifyingly looking men, several of them holding their torches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them yelled something, and the group of men took a step back, suddenly looking scared and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, what's going on here?” Eric demanded an explanation. He wasn't usually careless or acting cocky in the uncertain and clearly dangerous situation, but the mixture of confusion and the seeming unreality of what was going on made him determined to find out what the hell any of that meant, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the pirates - of course, these were pirates, stereotypical pirates that could as well have came out of a cartoon - seemed eager to answer his question.
“Where am I?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ehm…. You're on a ship...” said one of the men uncertainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”But according to even the briefest calculations using Bayesian probability, considering the priors available to me, the chances of that happening are infitesimally small!!” Eric felt that he was starting to panic, his attempts to explain how he could get out of the sunny California into the pirate ship in the middle of the night were crashing against the utter impossibility of that happening. Seeing that he was surrounded by a sea in every direction he could look wasn't helping.&lt;/p&gt;

Before anybody had time to say anything, the Dean suddenly appeared in the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, crap, I have just started hoping for a nice, normal day. I guess that doesn't happen in the Greendale, does it?" thought Jeff out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dean was wearing a fabulous light-blue dress, a wig of long light hair, and carrying 3 small stuffed dragons on his shoulders. "Hello everyone!! I am Deanarys Targaryen, the mother of dragons, and I am here to tell you that our school needs your help. Greendale is not the best school, but for generations we have been proud to hold the award for the best pacman score in the area, until City College took it from us 5 years ago. And now I am proud to say that we have an opportunity to get this honor back, return Greendale it's throne, so to speak." said he in a loud and cheerful voice while pointing at his dress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Oh, cmon, guys, please! You are our only chance! Greendale never had a team of heroes to be able to defeat the City College Dynasty of pacman players!! We are hosting the tournament this year, it will be too embarrassing to lose again!” said Dean in response to the disbelieving  stares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, I will kick their butts if it's so important to you. You may not know that, but in school I've always been something of a pacman prodigy.” said Troy with a cocky smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone stared at him in the stunned silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First day of the tournament started the next week, and it was not looking well for Greendale.
It all started when the City College team entered the campus.
Like superheroes ninja assassins their players envaded.
Walking in a weirdly discreet way, turning only in the right angles, never crossing anything diagonally, City College Dynasty of pacman players strode through the Greendale grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were legends that since their first steps these people were learning to walk only in straight lines, along the threads that were suspending small M&amp;amp;M's up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them carrying a flag with a sigyl each of the team members had on their cloth - pacman chasing the ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them were singing something that seemed like a gymn, played with an 8-bit melody, it's words were hard to distinguish, except for the /?repeated lines? that went “waka-waka”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy, looking shocked, turned around and stumbled away, mumbling something about “needing to practice more”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy was practicing energetically the whole time since he saw what he was up against.
He wasn't sure why he was so invested in the game(#q), but he knew that he had to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powerbars and soda cans were lying all around him in the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abed was glancing at him with a slightly worried looks from time to time. Troy should've taken it as a danger sign that this time it was &lt;em&gt;Abed&lt;/em&gt; who was worried about &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt;  behavior, but Troy didn't notice. He had pellets to collect and ghosts to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few minutes of intense gaming the controller fell to the floor as Troy's /?sat back? on the couch, his fierce glare turning into a grimmace of exasperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don't look upset. What's going on?” asked Abed with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last year's record was 827!! 827, Abed!! My best score is 563!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abed smiled slyly “I know what you need. You need a pac-sei.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A pac-what?…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Troy was spending all his time on practice, everyone else were getting busy meeting the City College team - to look for their weaknesses, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, everyone except for Jeff.
“Oh, cmon Jeff!! You have to help us to help Troy!! We have no chance without your help! It is important!” said Pierce persuasively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No I don't, yes you do, and no it's not. And why do you care?” replied Jeff without looking up from his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(#q)“Well, I may or may not have bet a /?considerable amount of money? on Troy winning this game”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why would you do that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, that happened before I saw the city college team, and I wanted to support Troy in his endeavor, because we are bros and that's what bros do ” //Pierce is overly enthusiastic about being bros with Troy in this episode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavy smoke rushed away from the door as the two figures, visible only as dark silhouettes in the bright light of a doorway, entered the small and dimly lit room. Quiet sound of gong signified the presence of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From behind the black-blue-yellow curtains, decorated with labyrinths and pellets and ghosts, came out the pac-master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he looked at the guests, his sight stopped on Troy.
“Hel-” began Troy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I knew this day day would come!” said the Master, with excitement in his voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wha…"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are the one! The chosen one, the only one capanle to defeat the dark warriors of the pac-Dynasty!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy suspected that there was something more than tobacco in the pac-master's pipe, but said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hello, ehm, pac-master. I am here to learn from you the ancient art of…. beating the pacman game with the highest score or something… ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know” said the Master, looking all incredibly wise and experienced. “Come with me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient computer stood in the clouded room.
Figures off ghosts and pellets were spread across the small space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy was dodging the stick with the ghosts at the end of it, pac-master was trying to reach him with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is this really necessary? I thought I was going to learn tp play the game!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To play pacman” (in a heavy accent) “you must learn to think like pacman, you must BE pacman!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Greendale Ben Chang was unrolling the red tape. The whole campus was /?inwebd? by it, as no straight 90 degree angle left in the entire college grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students were navigated the labyrinth of the tapes looking annoyed and confused, but not anywhere near as much as the /?opponents? have been. This was war, and Chang had only one weapon - of a psychological kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time you could see ghosts images and people in ghost costumes jumping from behind the corners inside buildings, /?breeding? panic among the City College students. 
Their team was looking distressed but determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the last battle everything was quiet in the Greendale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of the computer class there was a brightly lit /?boxing podium? with 2 computers old standing in the center of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited crowd gathered around the scene, and at the sound of gong, 2 players entered the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure in the black /?battle dress? with a yellow belt was the /?Chinese? player, the last survivor of the ruthless tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure in the black robes threw back it's /?head thingy? revealing the determined face of Troy barns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And so we met again" said he ominously.
The opponent replied with a sharp nod.
Well, let's get to it then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the battle has began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboard keys were pressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pellets were eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghosts were destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last seconds of the battle, Troy remembered in a flashback and applied the secret trick his teacher has taught him, thus defeating his opponent, and getting the glorious prize of a pacman-cup back to the Greendale.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="short-stories"></category><category term="commuity"></category></entry></feed>
