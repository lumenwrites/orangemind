&lt;p&gt;Pirate Cornelius was in a bad mood, and that had nothing to do with the storm. He was used to dealing with storms. What he was not used to dealing with was….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But according to even the briefest calculations using Bayesian probability, considering the priors available to me, the chances of that happening are infitesimally small!!” said the thin figure in the black pants and t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornelius looked at his crew. "Alright, which one of you idiots is responsible for taking &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;" the gesture to the figure “on our ship!? And why is he not feeding the sharks since 3 hours ago?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, boss, I'm sorry boss, but you've told us to bring a hostage! You've said that it should be someone from the rich family, but this one even better!! This is a magician!!” said Boram-the-giant, a huge muscular man, a great warrior but not a very sharp guy. He was bigger and stronger than Cornelius, but still very afraid of him - he saw what Cornelius did with many others who were bigger and stronger, yet not careful enough around him. Boram had every intention of staying on the captain's advisor good side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MAGICIAN?? What have you done you fools!! What will we do with the magician?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I've heard they are rich, and have all kinds of artifacts…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The point of taking a hostage was to trade him for money or immunity from federation's ships!! What do you think magicians will do when they find out we have one of their own? Give us money? Ha!! They can teleport into this ship or fly here on dragons or send ghosts on our heads!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look of shock and horror was dawning on the faces of everyone who heard that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh no.... But… but.. But what if we throw him overboard now, and nobody will have to know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah? Have you thought about what this one mage can do to us? I saw spells that burned and sank the whole fleets! And what makes you think that magicians don't know that we took him already? They have ways of knowing about each other." said the old one-legged pirate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, for all we know he is just toying with us, waiting for a pleasant moment to burn this ship or turn us into his fateful zombies or worse….” said skinny-Rick. He was not normally a fearful guy, but right now he wished he was very very far away from this ship, he also heard the tales of what magicians could do when they're angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But this is just a kid.” protested Boram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He. Is. A. MAGICIAN!!” yelled Cornelius. “What part of the word ‘magician’ don't you understand? They can cause tornadoes infested by flaming sharks &lt;em&gt;by accident&lt;/em&gt;!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric's head was spinning. Part of him was still hoping that this was an acid flashback, but the rest of him knew that it wasn't.
Just yesterday he was at his university, attending lectures, hanging with friends, working as a junior software developer in a cool startup, and today….. today was this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last normal thing he remembered was waiting for a cab in Palo Alto to take him to Stanford, when he thought that he saw a glimpse of a weird hooded figure(?). And the next moment, in a brief purple flash, he was standing under the rain, in the middle what seemed like an old town, illuminated only by a full bright moon peering from behind the clouds, and by fire, that was coming from a few burning buildings around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He remembered seeing 3 men with knives and old(?) guns running towards him. And after what seemed like a few minutes of chaos and running and chaos, he regained his consciousness on a wet wooden floor of a cabin. It was immediately obvious that he was on a ship, with all the /?ship equipment? laying around him and hanging off the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he was peeking through the door(which was unlocked), it suddenly jerked open, and the next moment he was dragged outside, and surrounded by a group of terrifyingly looking men, several of them holding their torches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them yelled something, and the group of men took a step back, suddenly looking scared and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, what's going on here?” Eric demanded an explanation. He wasn't usually careless or acting cocky in the uncertain and clearly dangerous situation, but the mixture of confusion and the seeming unreality of what was going on made him determined to find out what the hell any of that meant, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the pirates - of course, these were pirates, stereotypical pirates that could as well have came out of a cartoon - seemed eager to answer his question.
“Where am I?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ehm…. You're on a ship...” said one of the men uncertainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”But according to even the briefest calculations using Bayesian probability, considering the priors available to me, the chances of that happening are infitesimally small!!” Eric felt that he was starting to panic, his attempts to explain how he could get out of the sunny California into the pirate ship in the middle of the night were crashing against the utter impossibility of that happening. Seeing that he was surrounded by a sea in every direction he could look wasn't helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;to be continued....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="short-stories"></category><category term="pirates"></category></entry><entry><title>The Battle of Pacman</title><link href="/post/the-battle-of-pacman" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-01-25:post/the-battle-of-pacman</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Oh, please guys, you are our only chance? Greendale never had a team of heroes to be able to defeat the City College Dynasty of pacman players!! We are hosting the tournament this year, it will be too embarrassing to lose again!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, I will kick their butts if it's so important to you. You may not know that, but in school I've always been something of a pacman prodigy.” said Troy with a cocky smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone stared at him in the stunned silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First day of the tournament started the next week, and it was not looking well for Greendale.
It all started when the City College team entered the campus.
Like superheroes ninja assassins their players envaded.
Walking in a weirdly discreet way, turning only in the right angles, never crossing anything diagonally, City College Dynasty of pacman players strode through the Greendale grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were legends that since their first steps these people were learning to walk only in straight lines, along the threads that were suspending small M&amp;amp;M's up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them carrying a flag with a sigyl each of the team members had on their cloth - pacman chasing the ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them were singing something that seemed like a gymn, played with an 8-bit melody, it's words were hard to distinguish, except for the /?repeated lines? that went “waka-waka”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy, looking shocked, turned around and stumbled away, mumbling something about “needing to practice more”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy was practicing energetically the whole time since he saw what he was up against.
He wasn't sure why he was so invested in the game(#q), but he knew that he had to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powerbars and soda cans were lying all around him in the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abed was glancing at him with a slightly worried looks from time to time. Troy should've taken it as a danger sign that this time it was &lt;em&gt;Abed&lt;/em&gt; who was worried about &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt;  behavior, but Troy didn't notice. He had pellets to collect and ghosts to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few minutes of intense gaming the controller fell to the floor as Troy's /?sat back? on the couch, his fierce glare turning into a grimmace of exasperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don't look upset. What's going on?” asked Abed with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last year's record was 827!! 827, Abed!! My best score is 563!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abed smiled slyly “I know what you need. You need a pac-sei.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A pac-what?…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Troy was spending all his time on practice, everyone else were getting busy meeting the City College team - to look for their weaknesses, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, everyone except for Jeff.
“Oh, cmon Jeff!! You have to help us to help Troy!! We have no chance without your help! It is important!” said Pierce persuasively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No I don't, yes you do, and no it's not. And why do you care?” replied Jeff without looking up from his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(#q)“Well, I may or may not have bet a /?considerable amount of money? on Troy winning this game”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why would you do that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, that happened before I saw the city college team, and I wanted to support Troy in his endeavor, because we are bros and that's what bros do ” //Pierce is overly enthusiastic about being bros with Troy in this episode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavy smoke rushed away from the door as the two figures, visible only as dark silhouettes in the bright light of a doorway, entered the small and dimly lit room. Quiet sound of gong signified the presence of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From behind the black-blue-yellow curtains, decorated with labyrinths and pellets and ghosts, came out the pac-master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he looked at the guests, his sight stopped on Troy.
“Hel-” began Troy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I knew this day day would come!” said the Master, with excitement in his voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wha…"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are the one! The chosen one, the only one capanle to defeat the dark warriors of the pac-Dynasty!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy suspected that there was something more than tobacco in the pac-master's pipe, but said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hello, ehm, pac-master. I am here to learn from you the ancient art of…. beating the pacman game with the highest score or something… ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know” said the Master, looking all incredibly wise and experienced. “Come with me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient computer stood in the clouded room.
Figures off ghosts and pellets were spread across the small space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy was dodging the stick with the ghosts at the end of it, pac-master was trying to reach him with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is this really necessary? I thought I was going to learn tp play the game!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“To play pacman” (in a heavy accent) “you must learn to think like pacman, you must BE pacman!!”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Greendale Ben Chang was unrolling the red tape. The whole campus was /?inwebd? by it, as no straight 90 degree angle left in the entire college grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students were navigated the labyrinth of the tapes looking annoyed and confused, but not anywhere near as much as the /?opponents? have been. This was war, and Chang had only one weapon - of a psychological kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time you could see ghosts images and people in ghost costumes jumping from behind the corners inside buildings, /?breeding? panic among the City College students. 
Their team was looking distressed but determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the last battle everything was quiet in the Greendale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of the computer class there was a brightly lit /?boxing podium? with 2 computers old standing in the center of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited crowd gathered around the scene, and at the sound of gong, 2 players entered the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure in the black /?battle dress? with a yellow belt was the /?Chinese? player, the last survivor of the ruthless tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure in the black robes threw back it's /?head thingy? revealing the determined face of Troy barns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And so we met again" said he ominously.
The opponent replied with a sharp nod.
Well, let's get to it then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the battle has began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboard keys were pressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pellets were eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghosts were destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last seconds of the battle, Troy remembered in a flashback and applied the secret trick his teacher has taught him, thus defeating his opponent, and getting the glorious prize of a pacman-cup back to the Greendale.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="short-stories"></category><category term="commuity"></category></entry><entry><title>The first battle</title><link href="/post/the-first-battle" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-01-25:post/the-first-battle</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dash felt like he was going to pass out of exhaustion.
The battle was at it's hardest, and they were losing.
Vi was protecting him and Kyle with her force field while Kyle was struggling to keep his portal open while Dash was attempting to throw sleeping bombs at their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team they were fighting against included very powerful supers. One could control the metal, another, Pyro, could manipulate the fire, and finally, they had a telepath and seer. A seer!! How are you supposed to fight against someone who can literally see the future, even if for 8.5 seconds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant that whenever Dash was going to attack - seer would simply send a telepathic command to magnetto, and Dash would face a metal wall on his way, while having to dodge the streams of fire from Pyro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their only hope was to disable or confuse the seer.
And their only advantage was that dash was faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is not to choose a path that leads to victory, but to make sure that all the paths lead to victory - he remembered someone's quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vi!" said Dash, "Create the force field around the seer!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle's portals could not penetrate Vi's shield, there was a chance that seer's powers will not be able to do that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field around them disappeared, immediately reappearing around the seer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes!!" Apparently that was an attack that seer had no way of avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it was up to Dash and Kyle to disable the last 2 opponents, which suddenly became a lot more doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next second, right before the huge stream of fire was about to hit them, Kyle opened a portal, which consumed the fire and spat it out in the direction of magneto, who this time was unable to dodge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the time slowed down and things seemed to become share but more colorless, as Dash used the last burst of his power to run towards Pyro and shoot a stream of stunning rays at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then everything got quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyro was peacefully sleeping in the middle of the battlefield, seer was trapped in the force field, and magnet to was probably teleported into informatory by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We won!!" yelled Dash, as the simulated environment around them faded, slowly turning into the inwards of a sleeping capsule they used to simulate their training battles.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="short-stories"></category><category term="commuity"></category></entry><entry><title>Creating Story plot</title><link href="/post/creating-story-plot" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-01-16:post/creating-story-plot</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Story = Setting + Character + Plot&lt;/p&gt;

Climax - achieving/failing the goal
Event - step closer/farther from a goal.
Everything inbetween - struggling to get it(conflict)
Character - your avatar
Empathy, every step closer/farther to value - emotion
Plot is NOT the only value.
New patterns are value.
- Comedy
