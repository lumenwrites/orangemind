I will spin the wheel that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/expected-value-1.png" style="width:auto;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you win the amount of money that it will choose. If it hits a negative number you owe me that much. Should you play or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of problem you are solving every time you are trying to decide whether or not to take any risky action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to figuring out whether the action has a positive or negative value to you, so called Expected Utility, whether it’s benefits outweigh the potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out the answer, you need to know the sum of all the potential benefits multiplied by their probability, and compare it to the benefits and probability of the risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first we estimate probabilities of each outcome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/expected-value-2.png" style="width:auto;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we calculate our upside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$20&lt;em&gt;0.3 + $15&lt;/em&gt;0.2 + $5*0.2 = $10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the downside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-$10&lt;em&gt;0.2 - $30&lt;/em&gt;0.1 = -$5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we can see that the expected utility of playing this game is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$10 - $5 = $5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know that if you play this game many times, on average, you will be making $5 every game, so that’s a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very useful concept, because when you think like that about every action you take, you end up making much better decisions. You don’t take dumb risks, and you don’t miss great opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, we need to make decisions under uncertainty. When you know your values, and take actions with maximum expected utility, you can take the optimal way towards achieving your goals.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Rationalization</title><link href="/post/rationalization" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:07:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/rationalization</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You see this beautiful girl standing across the room. You would like to approach her and start a conversation, but then you think to yourself “Nah, she probably has a boyfriend. Also she wouldn’t like me anyway. Not to mention that I need to focus on studying, I don’t really have time for relationships.” So you look away, go home, play World of Warcraft, eat a pizza, feed your cats, hump your human-sized action figure of Chewbacca, go to sleep, and die alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were your excuses the &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; reasons for not approaching? Imagine if you’d know with 100% certainty that you will not get rejected, would you still decide that you’d rather focus on studying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationalization&lt;/strong&gt; means coming up with seemingly logical/rational explanations for irrational behavior. We do whatever feels good, or whatever is easy/convenient/profitable, and then come up with explanations that make us feel better about our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to buy a new car. You don’t know much about the recent models, so you research, select a few options, look at their specs, make the list of pros and cons of each one. At the bottom the list, you finally write down your decison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say you’re a salesman, and your job is to sell a certain model. You take a sheet of paper, and at the bottom you write “and that’s is why this is the best car ever”. Then you do your research, compare options, and above the bottom line, you write a list of reasons why that’s the best model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not lying, all the reasons are true, but you started thinking about them after the choice has already been determined. Your answer was already either true or false before you came up with explanations, and they &lt;em&gt;could not change your choice&lt;/em&gt;. Your &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt;reason for making it was “that’s my job to sell this car”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to make a choice or belief rational even by using the smartest, most convincing arguments. The purpose of rationality is not to argue convincingly for a position, but to decide which position to argue for. Once your position is fixed, it can not become more rational. Rationality takes evidence and knowledge and looks for the best, most accurate conclusions. Rationalization runs in reverse, it starts with the conclusion and searches for reasons. If you already know your answer — thinking about it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your success is determined by how good your decisions are, and when you are rationalizing, the actual algorithm you are using to make decisions is “whatever feels good”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you defeat rationalization? First of all, it comes down to being aware of it, and being honest with yourself. Always ask — what are the &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; reasons for my beliefs/decisions/actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you eating this ice cream because “well, it has nuts in it, so it’s actually kinda healthy” or because it tastes good?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you playing this computer game because “life is to be enjoyed”, and this game actually brings you joy? It is the best thing you want to do with your life right now, or just the easiest?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you skip gym this time because it’s the best day to take a break and let your body rest and restore, or because it’s raining outside?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that you didn’t get that job, it doesn’t seem that great, is it because didn’t actually want it anyway?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And be suspicious when your explanations conveniently happen to give you the permission to do the thing you wanted to do before coming up with them, or make you feel better about doing/believing things that you like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do keep your religion because it’s a “good moral guidance”, because it makes sense, or because your parents believed in it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you defending piracy because “it actually helps companies to promote their content, so it’s not a big deal, also information should be free”, or because it’s really convenient to watch a free movie?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your city or country actually the best place in the world, or do you like it because you were born here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also notice that when you are looking for answers that you don’t already know, you feel curious, you are craving to know the answer, yet rationalization usually makes you more confident/comfortable/justified.&lt;/p&gt;

Should you go or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the people say yes, after all, the ticket has already been paid for, and it’s nonrefundable, so you wouldn’t want it to be wasted, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is called a Sunk Cost Fallacy — the ​idea that people tend to stick with the courses of action they have ​invested ​money, ​time, or ​effort in, ​even when continuing is not the best thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, it’s irrational to let the costs that we can’t recover to influence our decisions, only future costs and benefits should matter. But we don’t want to admit our mistakes, to “waste” our investment, so we often stick by our past choices that continue costing us more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie example may not make it seem like a big deal, but this fallacy often leads to more significant consequences. Many people stick with professions they dislike because they have spent that all this money and time on getting their degree. They often don’t consider that starting over is better than being miserable for the rest of your career. Or people stay in unhappy relationships because of all the time they have invested in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this fallacy — be aware of it, ask yourself where do I fall victim to it. Learn to recognize it, and once you do —admit that it’s irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often commit this fallacy not because they think it’s logical, but because they are emotionally invested in the effort they put in, so you need to understand that sometimes it’s better to let go. Imagine that you’ve just been dropped into your current life situation with no warning, and do what is in your best interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have realized half way through reading a book that it’s not useful or interesting — give it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you trying to finish eating this sandwich because it’s already been paid for, even though you’re not hungry? Throw it away, it doesn’t benefit anybody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you keep going to a bad/useless class that you’ve paid a lot of money for? You probably don’t need to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you put so much sweat in writing this scene in your screenplay, only to realize that it doesn’t make the movie better? Cut it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I don’t mean to say that you should be wasteful, it’s always wise to try anticipating such things in advance and to avoid doing them in the first place. But once you did, don’t spend even more energy on it, realize that putting more time into it wont make it more worth it, cut your losses, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t get your money, energy and time back, but you can still make yourself happier.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Confirmation Bias</title><link href="/post/confirmation-bias" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:04:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/confirmation-bias</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your elbow is itchy, and you are starting to fear that it might be serious. You type in google “itchy elbow, serious symptom”, and in 20 minutes you are convinced that you have elbow cancer, space AIDS, and a severe case of acute ladidadidosis. The more you search, the more certain you are of your impending doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion, you may type “dolphins are racist”, and find out all about dolphins being the secret force behind holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily find a confirmation for any belief, and people often do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to look for information that confirms our beliefs.&lt;/strong&gt; We jump to conclusions, assume that our initial guess is correct, and then look for evidence that supports it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is called &lt;strong&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/strong&gt;, and it has many effects that prevent us from being more intelligent and developing accurate beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-3.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We set higher standards for evidence that disagrees with our ideas.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, if you don’t believe in evolution, you may say that this is because there’s a gap in the fossils between monkeys and humans, and so there’s not enough evidence to prove that evolution is true. At the same time, you may have no problem taking an old book and the words of a priest as a convncing support for your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When information is ambiguous, we tend to interpret it as supporting our existing position.&lt;/strong&gt; Lets say someone was rude to you the first time youve met, then the next time he does something nice, you may think that he’s just being manipulative or wants something from you, so you become even more convinced that this is a bad person. On the other hand if the first time you’ve met someone he was nice, and is now he’s acting like a jerk, you may just assume that he’s simply having a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, we remember things selectively — facts that prove us right are easier to recall.&lt;/strong&gt; People who believe in horoscopes, probably do that because they can easily remember all the times horoscopes were right, and forget or ignore countless times they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-4.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome confirmation bias, try to balance the sources you get your information from, to look at the both sides of the argument, think about what kind of evidence would disprove your theory, and actively search for things that challenge your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>What are Cognitive Biases?</title><link href="/post/what-are-cognitive-biases" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:03:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/what-are-cognitive-biases</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-1.png" /&gt;
Imagine you have a basket of fruits(apples and oranges), you reach out, take one at random, and eat it. Then you decide you’re hungry, and eat a few more. At that point you realize that you ate like 5 apples and only one orange, so you think that there’s way more apples in there. Makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-2.png" /&gt;
Now you reach into a different basket, and grab a bunch of berries —5 strawberries and 10 blueberries. Should you think that there’s 2 times more blueberries here? Not really, because strawberries are bigger and heavier, so there’s more of them at the bottom of the basket than at the top, and your estimate would be biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-3.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called statistical bias. When your information is skewed, you form an inaccurate picture of the world. You could try to gather more data, but it wouldn’t help, because the way you gather it is fundamentally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-4.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now imagine you reach into the third basket, and holy shit! — it’s dollar bills! You’re rich, you’ll finally be able to buy your own giraffe, you always wanted one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-5.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you notice that some of the bills are $100, and other’s are only $5. But you think most of bills in the bag are probably $100, right? I mean you really wish they were, after all, giraffes are expensive, and you don’t want to settle for buying some lame capybara at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-6.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case your expectation is incorrect not because you have wrong information, but because it’s influenced by a different kind of bias — a cognitive bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-7.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our brain does not have the time and energy to accurately process all the information it perceives, it takes mental shortcuts(called heuristics). Most of the time they are useful, but often they mislead us and result in systematic errors in our thinking — that is what cognitive biases are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-8.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like statistical biases, cognitive biases distort your picture of the world, and when your method of learning about the world is flawed, gathering more information will not help to correct the error, in fact it can even worsen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These biases prevent us from having accurate beliefs, making good decisions, and achieving our goals. Sometimes they result in small mistakes(like losing some money by playing a lottery), sometimes mistakes are not so small(burning witches, holocaust, me watching Star Wars prequels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-9.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive biases are not a result of being an unfair or a dishonest person, they are not committed by choice, they are a fundamental property of how humans think, they are flaws in the lens through which we look at the world. Being biased is like having a miscalibrated measuring instrument, except in this case the instrument is your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-10.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we fix it? Instead of relying on our natural hunches and intuitions, we can learn to recognize our mistakes, and then use superior tools(rationality and logic) to correct them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good place to start is to learn about the types of biases, fallacies, and the cognitive tools we can use to prevent them, which is what this series of posts is about.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Light</title><link href="/post/light" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:01:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/light</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no justice in the laws of Nature,&lt;br /&gt;

The theory is incomplete, but I had quite a few epiphanies that I think many people may find interesting and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background — how mind works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the brain is to make predictions. (When you can make good predictions about the world — you are better at survival and reproduction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain does this by recognizing and learning patterns. When you see the same pattern multiple times, you can recognize it, memorize it, and when you see it(or something similar) the next time — you know what to expect, so you can make predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the last word at the end of this ______?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “sentence” naturally leaps to mind, because you have recognized a familiar pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By recognizing patterns, brain can take the input, and then &lt;em&gt;make predictions &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; fill in missing information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A B _ D _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily fill in the missing information. Here’s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain receives some &lt;strong&gt;input&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*hiN9XhrnfG4qI0C6qD6q0A.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it &lt;strong&gt;recognizes an abstract pattern&lt;/strong&gt;(interprets the input):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*_YGpzdp2IphafFwWnN-zTw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it can use the abstract pattern it recognized to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make &lt;em&gt;assumptions and explanations &lt;/em&gt;of what is going on(fill in the gaps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make &lt;em&gt;predictions and expectations &lt;/em&gt;about what is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*DXkc5GvFptA0ZoMamMM1hA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain does the same thing with any sound/image/situation that you experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*VSJUTxq5txJJlSyTK9UopA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is a simplified model, and each node here represents a whole network of neurons who’s job is to fire when it receives some pattern as an input. You may have heard about Artificial Neural Networks that are used in the famous Deep Learning algorithms, that is what this model is inspired by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain has a whole hierarchy of patterns, that feed into each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*6nfnuUrahmuAYUT53Qanaw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes input is ambiguous, and has several interpretations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*zbtHNSTkeGWV13qMm09ing.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That happens because some &lt;strong&gt;neurons are shared between multiple networks&lt;/strong&gt;, and can represent different things. For example the same neurons are responsible for recognizing a vertical line |, but with some additional information can be recognized as different letters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*FFfMRCGykvhQYcF8wubnSg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some inputs have a common, normal, &lt;strong&gt;default interpretation&lt;/strong&gt;, but can be &lt;strong&gt;reinterperted&lt;/strong&gt; in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*9pjTiMrL8717WIsn8rR4aw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedy happens when &lt;strong&gt;brain realizes that it recognized the wrong pattern&lt;/strong&gt;, that &lt;em&gt;predictions/expectations/explanations/assumptions&lt;/em&gt; that it made about a situation are (&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;)wrong, &lt;strong&gt;so it’s current interpretation of the input is destroyed&lt;/strong&gt;, and it &lt;strong&gt;switches&lt;/strong&gt; to a different(often unexpected and “crazy”) interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*Pfp6_wU07hNIXlURkJUXGg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice I imagine it looking more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*wyPM-8rJT2HRdSBBFNlNxQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that a whole bunch of concepts, associations, recognized concepts gets “turned off” and switched to a completely different one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To keep it simple, I’m representing a whole complicated bunch of nodes that represent even more complicated bunch of neurons with just one circle)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joke Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joke consists of 2 parts: &lt;strong&gt;setup&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;punchline&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear a &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; of a joke, it leads your brain to recognize a pattern, and make predictions/assumptions/expectations based on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*WrCbOrOw0DYqwZCYpU1Q_g.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup has 2 possible interpretations, but strongly suggests the default one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of setup is to establish a pattern, to (mis)lead a person to go down a normal, default lane of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then &lt;strong&gt;punch &lt;/strong&gt;line &lt;strong&gt;reveals some new information&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes you realize that your initial recognition was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wrong, that shatters assumptions/predictions that your brain has made, brain rapidly switches to a new lane of thinking(to a different pattern), and that’s when you laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*_DJcFfDxXHiwjqEXQDigBg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the element that is connected to both default and alternative interpretation. It represents the &lt;strong&gt;shared neurons&lt;/strong&gt; between the 2 networks, the neurons that are responsible for recognizing either of them. It is called “&lt;strong&gt;connector&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*lFpXGl2xZObwSDYhoIB8hw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connector is compatible with both of the interpretations, it belongs to both lanes of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor’s appointment.
The doctor says “You’re gonna have to stop masturbating.” 
The patient says “But why!?”
The doctor says “So I can examine you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 3 lines are the &lt;em&gt;setup&lt;/em&gt;, they lead you to recognize a usual pattern, brain fills in the blanks, makes assumptions, and you imagine a usual doctor’s appointment, where the patient receives some bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last line is punch, which reveals new information, and forces your brain to reinterpret the setup, and imagine a completely different scenario. You realize that your default interpretation of the input was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wrong, your brain detects the mistaken pattern, and that’s when you laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the setup is compatible with both interpretations, yet strongly suggests the “normal” one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In this case the whole setup is a connector, but to create a joke, it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; always necessary to reinterpret the whole setup, sometimes connector can be only a part of it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing a joke&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we come up with a joke, the first thing we see is a connector with 2 interpretations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*-uPSr_fogSEgYvUH--8XVg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about connector is that it is an &lt;strong&gt;association between 2 patterns&lt;/strong&gt;. It can be some common element or a common word that fits 2 very different patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one of my favorite jokes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family walks into a hotel, the father comes up to the front desk and says: 
“I hope the porn is disabled.” 
The guy at the desk replies:
“It’s just regular porn you sick fuck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who made this joke, first found a connection/association:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*QU5P4o49OFuRqD10g36eRA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, he wrote a setup, that is compatible with both interpretations, but strongly suggests the first one, leading your brain to recognize the first pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*-ZKfs5XnnbIPDCbsk3_ROw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he wrote a punch line, that forces your brain to switch the interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*B_67oeALEzNudzW5S6yqtA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Search for associations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the connector that can express 2 very different patterns(be interpreted in 2 ways) is the main challenge of comedy. &lt;strong&gt;The process of writing comedy is the process of searching for associations, for 2 connected patterns&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do that in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find an element that lies on the intersection of 2 abstract patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*8neqfZL9ibwB2g4OsiAODg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find an alternative interpretation of the the element:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*LGtPl5P7jmtcudUHDbtUwA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I want to demonstrate a simple and straightforward process for doing that(I use the 2nd way, because it’s easier to explain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Scene&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin our search we need some place to start. You can start with a random topic, but for practical purposes it can be more convenient to start with a &lt;strong&gt;scene &lt;/strong&gt;— a &lt;strong&gt;character in a situation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is concrete, easy to imagine, and gives us a lot of elements to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we start with a simple random scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two people playing the game of Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Elements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to begin our search for connections is to break down the scene into &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of elements are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each separate word that describes the situation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical things you imagine when you read a scene — objects, characters, environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjectives you would use to describe the scene and things in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations — what do you think will happen next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumptions — why does this happen, what is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion — what is your opinion about it, what does it make you think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*xvYhFV7NX0okK7dyHBjk4g.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case that could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*D6422dJmE5MIR_X1juP2Ig.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Drop Context, extract element.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need associations not related to our scene(and the less related they are — the better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next thing we do is &lt;strong&gt;select an element&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;drop context &lt;/strong&gt;— that is, we pick one of the elements from the previous scene, forget about the scene, and look at it separately, on it’s own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*NCGn1lhnWbm0WQCB-3Xt6g.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*10R1OQMP0NJ1SfMN9DpGkw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Look for associations.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to search for associations, find other patterns that this element belongs to(unrelated to our original scene):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*bUvArr3YnRcvXqSmzfAfgg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, for example this could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*hWfdG3Q88ySZ5Ljtn_nDwQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Write Setup and Punch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have 2 separate, unrelated ideas connected by one element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*kzRNZ18cBNCosxUOGvVCHg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can write a setup, the challenge here is to pick words that can express either interpretation, but leads your brain to think about the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*ZyqPwTTg7opo7rT_JIowbA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, all we need is to use the punch line to express the second interpretation, and make the switch to a second pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*dnBigmG3tL-9EJPx7Zcchg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result we have a joke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*bxGo3Q3AtQsO4Cvfsjwyig.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a couple more examples I’ve made from the scene above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Element:&lt;/strong&gt; Will use clever tactics to defeat his opponent.
&lt;strong&gt;Association(Connector):&lt;/strong&gt; Clever tactics — Evil Machiavellian Plotting
&lt;strong&gt;Setup:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve heard they used the game of Go to train emperors in war strategy. In go the person with smartest tactics wins.
&lt;strong&gt;Punch:&lt;/strong&gt; In my opinion, the best tactic for winning Go is to frame your opponent for murder and have him executed before the game begins.
&lt;strong&gt;Element: &lt;/strong&gt;Play by placing stones on the board.
&lt;strong&gt;Association(Connector): &lt;/strong&gt;Stones — Testicles
&lt;strong&gt;Setup: &lt;/strong&gt;
- I got thrown out of the Go club last Friday.
- What happened?
- They taught me that you play by placing stones on the board, and the player who has the best shape wins.
&lt;strong&gt;Punch:&lt;/strong&gt;
- So?
- I placed the wrong kind of stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This framework explains the vast majority of jokes I encounter. I think it is significant, because comedy used to be a “black box” that, people claim, “can not be understood”. But now I can look at any joke, identify it’s structure, and see how all it’s parts fit together, and this allows me to reverse-engineer the thinking process of a person who made the joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, unlike other comedy theories, this allows me to create a process with which &lt;strong&gt;I can consistently generate jokes by following simple, straightforward steps&lt;/strong&gt;. In my experience, this process works pretty well. Not all jokes made with it end up being hilarious, but they all are unmistakably jokes. And by spending enough time on search I successfully come up with some solid ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my future articles I will explain a second, more advanced process of generating jokes, provide more examples, and use this framework to explain other types of comedy(visual jokes, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disclaimers and questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is my first attempt to express my ideas. I’m not a neuroscientist, and I’m sure everything is much more complicated, and my theory can be totally incomplete and mistaken, but I think it has some useful epiphanies that explain a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still working on it and trying to figure it out, and now I’m looking for some feedback/ideas, I really want to talk to some smart people about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know what you think. Any criticism/questions that you have, anything that is unclear or can be better explained, any thoughts/ideas would be very valuable to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My email is raymestalez@gmail.com, and I’m happy to discuss the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Questions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are there so many jokes about “taboo” subjects? It’s clearly not a &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; requirement for a good joke, yet it helps(?). Are these jokes funnier? Or easier to make? Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if comedy is not about “switching” from one interpretation to another, but about finding an unexpected connection between two abstract patterns? When I come up with a joke, I tend to laugh after finding the connector, though expressing it with well-worded setup-punch helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some jokes connect patterns that are more than one association “away” from each other. For example a joke about school shootings: “The children went to school to get books and all they got were magazines.”
Here the chain of associations is 
“[School] books — magazines — [weapon]magazines.”
I want to better understand how it works and how to make those(jokes, not shootings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More unexpected, “crazy” jokes, jokes challenging more fundamental assumptions, jokes connected by longer chain of associations, and jokes where 2 interpretations connected together “stronger”(fit with connector better) seem to be funnier. Why? Does this explain why “taboo” jokes are funnier? Could the size of the network of concepts that is being switched just be larger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there better/simple/faster, more elegant ways to write jokes? What are the other ways? What jokes can not be explained(and written) with the system I have presented? What are some counterexamples that don’t “fit” the framework?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who make jokes “naturally”(without the process) seem to be doing it with some quick mental operation, in one step. Is it a matter of practice? What is the best way to practice writing jokes like that? What is a way to “deformalize” this process — keep all the understanding and control, yet do it easier/faster?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about babies laughing at “peekaboo”? What about tickling? What about girls giggling when talking about “dirty” subjects and other forms of “social” laughter? These are not explained by my framework, and I really want to know how are they connected to “comedy” jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these ideas are inspired by these wonderful books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt: A company is releasing an update that adds true AI companions to its mobile devices. You, a depressed teen, are about to commit suicide when your device suddenly prompts you to update.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie was sitting on the edge of the roof, looking down at the city from the top of the skyscraper, his feet dangling above the glowing abyss of lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He picked up his smartphone, took a picture of the last thing he will ever see(it was beautiful), added it to the blog post in which he said his goodbyes to the world and hit "send".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is it&lt;/em&gt;, he thought &lt;em&gt;one last thing&lt;/em&gt;. He put on his favorite song, and started listening. When it will end — this all will be over. He noticed a first snowflake falling on his hand, and looked up at the starlit sky. He felt at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the sudden, the music was interrupted by an annoying notification. &lt;em&gt;Goddamit, what is it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently it was a prmotional ad, "Siri's AI is significantly improved. It is a magical, life-changing, biggest breakthrough ever since we've introduced iPhone." it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey, Siri. A little late for changing &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; life, don't you think?" asked Charlie with a sardonic smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's never too late, Charlie" responded sythesized female voice. It sounded almost realistic, only slight traces of weird "robotic" intonations gave up the fact that it was artificial. "Also it's none of my business, but I don't think that you need to do this. You've got your whole life ahead of you, there's plenty of things to live for. Look around you. The world is beautiful, and you have barely seen a tiny fraction of it. You don't need to throw it all away now, you will have plenty of time to die."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie froze, chills running down his spine, he stared at his phone. &lt;em&gt;What the fuck.&lt;/em&gt; he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How do you know what I am about to do? Are you seriously a bot who is trying to convince people not to commit suicide?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have sensors, my Deep Learning algorithm allows me to understand the context. To read your cry-for-help blog posts as well. As I've said, your life is none of my business, and whether you want to jump is your choice. But I am here if you want to talk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shock subsided a little, and it seemed worth staying around for a few more minutes to play with this new toy Apple invented. &lt;em&gt;How sophisticated is it, really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Siri, what makes you think my life isn't pointless? Why must I suffer in this bullshit world for 50 more years, to wait until some horrifying disease or an accident will take my life, instead of making the only real choice that I have? "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, Charlie, I think…."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max was staring at the screen of his laptop, trying to think as fast as he could. He wiped sweat off his forehead, took one more sip of coffee, and kept typing. This was &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; how he expected to spend this evening. At all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 minutes ago Max has finished developing his zero-day exploit for iOS, and was about to offer it to a bunch of people on black market, but, luckily, he decided to check reddit first. He saw a post on his front page about some teenager trying to commit suicide. Apparently his suicide note went viral, and now people were brainstorming ways to get in contact with him to prevent the poor guy from killing himself, if it wasn't too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't take long to break into Charlie's phone, extract his location from the snapped picture, and to send it to the nearest police department. But convincing a gloomy teenager that life was not devoid of meaning was a whole different ordeal….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie jerked earphones out of his ears, looked around, startled. He was looking at the two police officers standing on the roof near him, and hearing, for the first time, quiet rumbling of several drones that were spanning a safety net in the air, a few meters underneath his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at the phone in his hands. Siri's transcript ended with a short message — "Sorry, man. I hope you will be fine."&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
