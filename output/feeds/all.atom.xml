&lt;p&gt;False Dichotomy means taking a complex issue, and boiling it down to 2 simple mutually exclusive choices, when in reality there’s more alternatives available. To make their side look more appealing, people present nuanced arguments as black and white, or take extremes and pretend like they are the only options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of thinking often leads to ignoring potential solutions, and prevents us from gaining an accurate understanding of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also leads to polarization of opinions — people treat an argument as a battle against the opposite side, and as a result take more and more extreme positions. Sometimes people are afraid to offer measured opinions because their own side will call them a traitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example a politician may demonize drugs and suggest longer sentences for drug addicts, because taking a more balanced view will make him look like he supports drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other examples of this fallacy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either you are with us or against us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either we improve this law or everyone will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either you go to church or you are a bad person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either you are a republican or a democrat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome it, remember that in reality things are rarely one-sided. Most of the time complex issues have costs and benefits. Optimizing for values often requires trade offs. To get the most accurate picture, you want to see flaws and advantages of both positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you support one side of the with one group of people, doesn’t mean you have to automatically agree with everything that side says and reject the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Tips on achieving the flow</title><link href="/post/flow" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-06-04:post/flow</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*m5GeSfHJOhQC_xKa.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips on achieving the flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29"&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing state that you enter when you’re completely immersed into some activity. It is a state of high consciousness and full engagement. It is the reason people are doing complicated and creative things like art and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow is one of the best experiences in life. This is what makes you passionate about what you do, you get the core happiness in your life out of doing the thing you love. It gives you full immersion, extreme productivity, nonstop energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re in the flow you’re completely focused, present, on top of your performance. You’re working at the edge of your abilities, all of your faculties are focused on one activity, your sense of time and of self dissolves, because your brain has no resources left to sustain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result you are extremely driven, and you get good at what you do fast just by naturally doing what you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you achieve it? Here are the elements you need to make it work well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set clear and valuable goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that you need is a simple, unambiguous goal that you value and know how to achieve, a challenge that you know how to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If what you want to do is a big and complicated task — break it down into multiple smaller ones, then breakdown the first of them into several parts again, and do that until you have an easy first step that takes 20 minutes or less to accomplish. By the way this goal setting, breaking down, and planning often IS the first easy step to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*rQBmbr9dfft3IE_0.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also notice that the goal should be at the right level for you, it should be simple enough for you to feel confident and competent, yet challenging enough to be interesting. Ideally, your task should be a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit more challenging than you’re used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And make sure that what you do really matters to you. Your brain won’t engage into taking steps towards goals you don’t care about, so make it clear how valuable the goal is to you, and how the steps you’re taking bring you closer to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take your time. Don’t resist being out of state. Build momentum.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, getting into flow is like falling asleep — it takes time, it is a result of particular actions, but you can not force yourself into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re not a computer, and you most likely won’t enter the state in the first 30 seconds. Usually it takes around 20 minutes, sometimes less(if task is very clear, interesting and engaging). Sometimes it can take longer, and you need to realize — it is perfectly normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being lazy and uninterested(‘out of state’) at the beginning is perfectly fine, nobody can switch into a focused mode in seconds. Just trust the process and keep going through the right steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set up a timer(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt; can be very helpful) for 20–30 minutes, and decide to completely focus on the task for this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focus and Presence.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plug off. Remove distractions, both external and internal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start, your mind usually tends to wander away and get distracted from the task. Realize that it’s normal, don’t beat yourself up, just gently get your attention back to the question you’re thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of focus is similar to meditation, by learning to meditate you learn to you “turn off” all of the unrelated thoughts, and get into the present moment, focus on the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also — think ‘inside’ the process, don’t be ‘meta’. If you’re writing — write, if you’re painting — paint. Don’t get distracted on organizing your workspace or trying to figure out the best tools and techniques to do it. It feels productive, but it often isn’t. Don’t confuse being focused on the process itself with being focused on figuring out how it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intent + freedom from outcome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In creative work, you often can not control the outcome of what you’re doing. When you’re just learning to write, code, or paint, you can not directly control how good the end result will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why it’s best not to worry about the final outcome, and focus on taking the right steps, optimizing your process, learning your skills, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_%28learning_method%29"&gt;deliberate practice&lt;/a&gt;. These are the things you can directly control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measure the results you can directly control, and gain satisfaction and rewards from that. Outcome that you get is a side effect of your actions, and you can not directly control it. Judge how well you’re doing based on your actions, not the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Manage your expectations to make your emotional state go up.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy every little step forward that you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important for taking steps forward be fulfilling and satisfying for you, that keeps you motivated and enjoying the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to feel happy and excited after accomplishing every task, instead of just getting tired and exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manage your expectations. Learn to enjoy taking steps forward, don’t beat yourself up, instead — pat yourself on the back for every bit of progress. That makes you more engaged and keeps you loving the process and wanting to do it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry about how fast you are going, or how well you’re doing. Just taking action is all that matters and all you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do. Action and going through the process is what gets you into flow and gives you results. Consciously focus on feeling good about yourself after taking each little step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a great talk on applying this principle in pick up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="flex-video youtube widescreen"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="853" height="480"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bUJdJIxgI7U?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Immediate gratification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get into the flow, you need the actions you take to feel rewarding. You need to find a way to immediately see results of your actions, to measure how well you’re doing, and receive positive reinforcement once you accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understand what you do.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t just go through the motions, this is the best state-killer. Have a clear plan, clear goal, understand each step that you take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you’re in charge and in control of what’s happening. Flow is about thinking and working with your mind, solving tasks, and knowing what you do and how you’re doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to replace this by going through random motions. Realize that rushing does not makes you more effective. What makes you faster and more effective — is skill, careful and calm thinking, planning, understanding, consciously applying the principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let go of or get back to basics.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’re already in the strong flow constantly checking out the principles may become a distraction. So once you’re in and it’s working — you may want to let go of the principles, and just enjoy being in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it stops working and you’re feeling like you’re falling out of the process — don’t try to bruteforce through it. Stop. Think. Look at the checklist of the main principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I have a good task?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am iI focused or distracted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I jave a crystal clear understanding of what I’m doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out what you’re not doing. Fix it. It’s not about power, it’s about simply going through the right actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my favorite principles of learning, ideas that will help you to acquire skill in the fastest and the most efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Massive action.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all — take massive action. Learning without doing — it’s like reading books about body building without ever going to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your knowledge about the subject is like a map that shows you how to get to the goal. Action — is actually moving forward and walking a way towards it.
Find a minimum of necessary knowledge to be able to start acting — and then act. Don’t procrastinate by reading tons of books before you start. You will learn all the information that you need along the way. Come up with a practical challenge, figure out the first little step that you need to take — and then take it. If you’re reading information for a good practical reason you will learn it so much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main force behind progress, this is the source of real experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deliberate practice.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, and equally important principle. Deliberate practice means consciously setting challenges for yourself and solving them. Constantly pushing forward instead of just going through the repetitive motions. Always figure out how to do new things that are a little above your current level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set new challenges that are hard to accomplish, understand how to accomplish them, and then repeat it until they feel automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cultivate your passion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoying what you do is crucial. You &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to love what you do to get really good, it is not optional. If you don’t love what you do — you’re doing it wrong. Getting mastery at anything is a long process, it’s a marathon, not a sprint, and you won’t get too far relying only on your will power. They say that you need 10000 hours of practice to become a pro, nobody can put so much effort into something if it’s not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also life is to short to do things that you don’t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t feel a strong passion now — don’t worry. Passion is not a preexisting quality that you either have or don’t have. It is something that you can learn and develop. Look for ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thinking. Understanding first, speed and efficiency — later.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t rely on your subconsciousness. Don’t expect to get good by mindlessly doing something over and over again, without understanding how, hoping that you’re “training your subconsciousness”, hoping that mere repetition will make you better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with doing things slowly, understand each step. And &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; your brain gets used to it and automates the process, which enables you to do it faster or focus on more precise details. But don’t try to skip to this part, don’t hope that you can get good without detailed understanding of how you’re doing it, understanding always comes first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*F7Hu2xLZNEt0OlDn.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn to get in the flow.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flow is a state of being completely immersed in what you’re doing. When you’re in flow you’re completely focused, present, and very efficient. This state feels incredibly good, and makes you extremely productive. Read &lt;a href="https://medium.com/orange-mind/tips-on-achieving-the-flow-fea7204daaf5"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for tips on how to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consistency(is more important than speed)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting good at something is a long term task. Getting better consistently is a lot more important than getting better fast. Approach everything you do with that idea in mind. Do not rush, keep in mind the big picture. Make sure that you’re not stressing yourself out so you won’t quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care of your health. Make sure that your lifestyle is sustainable. You need to keep steady pace, you need to be able to keep doing what you’re doing years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop habits that you can do every day that will naturally lead you to where you want to be in a long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn Inner game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;activity has “outer game” — things that you do physically, your technical skills; and “inner game” — your attitudes to what you do, your mindset, everything that happens in your head while you’re doing it. Inner game is equally important, so learn it, pay attention to it. It includes your ability to focus and deal with stress, your state of mind, your emotional intelligence, your ability to focus, proactively set and accomplish goals, etc. If you’re stuck or unable to move forward — it is possible that your problem is not in knowledge or in technical execution, but in your inner game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria"&gt;SMART&lt;/a&gt; goals. Have a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is most useful way to move forward and not get lost. Reflect on your major life long-term goals, break them down into smaller ones, that you can accomplish in relatively short period of time. Breakdown smaller ones even further — you can set your weekly, your daily goals. This is amazing way to make any task manageable, to track your progress, to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will help you to be sure that you know what you do and that you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Know that you can&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ll do anything for 10 years straight — there’s no way you won’t become a master(of course, some level of brain usage required). Understand that if you won’t quit — success is inevitable. Don’t let anybody mess with your confidence, to tell you what you can’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between intelligent course-correcting and irrational fears/doubts. It’s a cliche — but “believe in yourself”. Once you have made a decision — don’t doubt it. If failing is not an option for you — you won’t fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t compare yourself to the masters and think “I’ll never be able to do this”, it will just stand in your way and waste your time. Just focus on practice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Tips on self-control and will power</title><link href="/post/will-power" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-06-04:post/will-power</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*34FBGQCQNsJmVhky.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to be proactive, stay consistent and do what you think is right.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self control and being proactive is hard. Trying to follow through on your decisions is one of the biggest challenges you will face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important skills to achieve your goals and become an awesome person is being able to stay consistent, to act based on your decisions, not on the emotion you’re feeling in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the best situation is when you’re “naturally” driven to do the right thing, so you do that just because you want to. And I think you should always try to do things that way — it’s more fun and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often to make cool lifestyle easy and natural you need to implement some habits, switch your old action patterns and get used to new behaviors.
I came up with some ideas that helped me to make this process much easier. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn to distinguish rationalization from the “real” thinking. Realize that it’s not a logical issue — it’s an emotional one.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often you can spend a lot of time and energy just on deciding whether you should act the right way or “cut yourself some slack” and do what you feel like doing. For example you decided to get on the diet, and on the next day you start thinking “well, one little candy is not a big deal”, “so what, now I will never eat a cheseburger in my life? that’s not cool”, “well, coffee is kind of healthy, energy drink could make me leaner”. And you start thinking that you have logical dilemma here. At that moment you need to recognize:
&lt;em&gt;This is not a problem of logic or understanding, it’s an emotional one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationalization is a psychological tool that everybody uses every day to maintain the illusion of being in control of his actions. We think that we act based on our logic, but very often we don’t. What happens is that we act based on our feelings/emotions, and then our brain tries to &lt;em&gt;rationalize&lt;/em&gt; — logically justify these actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what you need to do — is to learn to distinguish the “real”, rational thinking, when you use reason and logic to find out what’s best for you, from rationalization — when you are basically just coming up with excuses to do what you feel like doing, excuses that look &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; similar to logic, but aren’t it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think rationally and make real decisions about diet when you’re in a comfortable, not hungry state, but if you get hungry — don’t trust your brain, what you’re thinking about has nothing to do with logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*aPNxwpH83024sW95.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good way to call this is “trusting in your higher self”. There are moments in your life when your mind is bright, sharp, alert — when you can think clearly and make the best decisions. That’s your “higher self”. And then there are moments when you’re angry/hungry/horny/lazy/sleepy/etc, when you’re in haze and out of state, when you can’t think clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make decisions when you’re in your higher self, and when you’re in the mode of lower consciousness — just trust them and don’t argue, understand that now it’s not the best time to change the plan that you’ve developed when you were much smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So — learn to distinguish true thinking from rationalizations, recognize when you’re in the lower consciousness. And once you do — realize that you don’t have the logical problem, you don’t need to “understand” anything right now, you know &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; what’s the right thing. You just don’t feel like doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now you don’t have doubts anymore, you trust the decisions that you’ve made when you were in the higher state, you can clearly see what you should do. And instead of dealing with understanding &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; emotion, all that’s left is to deal only with the emotion/mood, make yourself to take the right actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what’s right, and your task is clear — get yourself to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Replace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to know that whatever negative habits you having — you’re having them for a reason. They’re satisfying some of your needs, and that is good. They’re just doing it not in a way you like, for example dumb, unhealthy, or counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like TV satisfies your need for stimulation and adventure, or like crappy food satisfies your hunger and desire for salt/sugar. And you can’t just reject that need, unless you’re like 120 years old yogi, or the hulk of the will-power. So the first thing you do — find a good and healthy ways to satisfy all of your desires, that will make your life so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step of starting the diet — stuff the fridge with healthy food and fruits. First step of quitting TV — buying bunch of cool books you’ve always wanted to read. If you’re thinking about eating some junk food—the first thing to do is to eat a ton of healthy food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s a craving — don’t reject it, satisfy it. In a healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Direct your focus. Use meditation to direct your thoughts. Master your emotions.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment"&gt;Marshmallow experiment&lt;/a&gt;— cool experiment done by Stanford scientists. They put kids in one room with a tasty marshmallow, and told them that “I will walk away now, if you won’t eat this marshmallow in the next 15 minutes I will come back and give you another one, so you’ll have 2.″ And walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they observed how kids were trying to avoid eating the marshmellow. Turned out that the ones who succeeded did the same thing — turned away from it, found some distraction, way to stop thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand — no way in hell you will act right if you’re constantly thinking about marshmallow. This will deplete your will power in no time. If you want to do the right thing — consciously direct your focus away from thinking about doing the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn to do that — is to learn meditation. This will teach you to control your thinking, and think only the thoughts that you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will power is more emotional issue than an intellectual one. Trying to convince yourself to act right is fine, but don’t “argue” with yourself, it’s futile and only burns your will power. Stop the “thinking” about whether you should do the right thing, don’t question it, and switch to thinking about something productive as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to control your emotions, develop the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence"&gt;emotional intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, learn to feel what you want to feel at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Right associations. Pain/pleasure. Value.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re evolved to seek pleasure and to avoid pain. Our actions are controlled by the oldest and dumbest part of our brain. This thing can not do any sophisticated reasoning, it just makes you to go where it thinks the value is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it developed to help us to survive, but, especially in modern times, this mechanism is very often misfires. So — don’t associate value with wrong stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need to do is to train your mind to associate the pain/pleasure with the right thing. Condition yourself to associate the good things with the joy of life and fulfillment, with the ultimate pleasure. And bad things with pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you associate hamburger with tasty nutrition it is almost irresistible, if you associate it with heart disease and cancer — it’s becomes lot less tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make right associations use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reframing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reframing"&gt;Reframing&lt;/a&gt; is simply looking at things from the different angle, perceiving the world differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example you can reframe feeling hungry into the feeling of getting lean. You can actually learn to enjoy being hungry(to some extent), because you choose to perceive it as pleasure, as something valuable. Make a connection in your mind “I’m hungry = I’m getting prettier and healthier”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing with exercise or with work — reframe the feeling of being tired into feeling of getting stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Realize that it’s a bigger choice. Upwards/downwards cycles.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realize that this little decision affects a lot more than you think. It’s very easy to do some little thing wrong, like eat a little cookie when you decided not to, precisely because it’s “not a big deal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you need to see that in fact it’s a much bigger deal than it seems. All of your decisions and actions depend on each other, and every little step either triggers the positive chain of events, or negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I ate a cookie, I might as well eat this chocolate/watch this movie/etc”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example you go to the gym -&amp;gt; your self esteem grows -&amp;gt; you’re proud of yourself and inspired -&amp;gt; you decide to read a good book instead of watching tv -&amp;gt; you’re even more proud, you want to eat healthier -&amp;gt; next day you feel even better so you’re more likely to go to the gym again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you eat hamburger -&amp;gt; you feel bad, your brain works worse -&amp;gt; you’re less likely to exercise -&amp;gt; you’re even dumber and in lower state -&amp;gt; you’re less likely to do exercises and eat properly -&amp;gt; you’re more likely to eat one more hamburger -&amp;gt; you feel even shittier and dumber -&amp;gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad decisions mess with your vision of yourself, your identity as a proactive happy person, they harm all the areas of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that it’s true. Eating a little cookie is not just about consuming little amount of calories, it makes you MUCH more likely to screw up in other areas of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always be aware, every little decision triggers chains of events, so when you decide to fail in executing some “unimportant” action — you need to see how it may really fuck you over in a bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So look atthe big picture. Eating a little candy is not a big deal, but you know that the fact of eating this candy will affect your self-respect, consistency, and will damage your other areas. It’s not just about a candy. It represents all the bad things in your life, shitty patterns of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the same time — see all the beautiful things, all the happiness that good decisions may lead to, even very little ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gradually build macro momentum.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the video above, Tyler explains this idea amazingly. See the level that you’re at, and gradually build up your powers to do more and more complicated stuff. Don’t expect to get amazing in a matter of days, take right but simple actions that will make you great in a year. Start simple and improve gradually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoid micro fuckups.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idea related to previous one. It’s so easy, and so destructive to fail at little things. Learn to see the moments when you make a small wrong decisions, they’re easiest ones to miss, and they’re the ones that bring you down. When you have a great momentum going on — no way you will start screwing up with something big — you see the harm behind it too clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever starts taking drugs from heroine. When you’re doing good — you won’t just go and eat at McDonalds or get depressed, but it is very possible to gradually slide down into that. So be aware of micro-fuckups, little failures that are turning into a large trouble over time. See the pain behind them, focus on it. Pay special attention to failures that seem like “not a big deal” and don’t allow them to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identity change.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t just try to change your behaviors, try to change your identity. Instead of just developing your habits you also need to develop the right beliefs about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for you not to murder people, or to not steal, or not to do drugs — because you know that you are not “that kind of person”. You’re not prohibiting yourself to do that, you just believe that you’re not a guy who would do such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need to do is to develop similar kind of beliefs about any kind of behavior that you want to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not the kind of person who eats shitty food”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m inspired and do what I do because I love it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not forcing myself to act right, that’s just the way I do things, because I’m awesome”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowing that you can.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your desire to do some particular activity is calculated by a simple formula:
(Perceived value, how much do you want to achieve something)*(probability of the result).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your chance to get the reward by doing certain thing is 50/50 — it means that you will have half as much motivation as you would have if you would be 100% sure of the reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that the more optimistic you are, the more you believe that what you do will give you results that you want — the more motivation you will have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Know that “last time” is always a lie.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many “last times” did you have already? Saying that “I’m doing this for the last time” is always a lie. If you don’t have enough reasons to act right today — you won’t have enough reasons to do that tomorrow, in the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Turn bad habits that you enjoy into reward instead of eliminating them completely.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of quitting TV forever — decide to watch an episode of your favorite show once you’ve accomplished some task. That way you won’t feel pressure of cutting something that you like out of your life completely, and at the same time — have a nice little motivation to do the productive things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make it natural.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t overestimate your will power, it can get you only so far. Strive to achieve the real joy from what you’re doing, act right because it feels good.
No tricks will keep you motivated fo a long time unless you’re doing something that “works” for you, unless you’re getting a joy out of it, at least on some level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find ways to make doing the right thing “naturally” fun and easy for you. Always look for ways to do what you love and love what you do.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Expected Utility</title><link href="/post/expected-utility" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:08:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/expected-utility</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine I offer you a gamble. I will spin the wheel that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/expected-value-1.png" style="width:auto;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you win the amount of money that it will choose. If it hits a negative number you owe me that much. Should you play or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of problem you are solving every time you are trying to decide whether or not to take any risky action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes down to figuring out whether the action has a positive or negative value to you, so called Expected Utility, whether it’s benefits outweigh the potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out the answer, you need to know the sum of all the potential benefits multiplied by their probability, and compare it to the benefits and probability of the risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first we estimate probabilities of each outcome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/expected-value-2.png" style="width:auto;"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we calculate our upside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$20&lt;em&gt;0.3 + $15&lt;/em&gt;0.2 + $5*0.2 = $10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the downside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-$10&lt;em&gt;0.2 - $30&lt;/em&gt;0.1 = -$5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we can see that the expected utility of playing this game is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$10 - $5 = $5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know that if you play this game many times, on average, you will be making $5 every game, so that’s a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very useful concept, because when you think like that about every action you take, you end up making much better decisions. You don’t take dumb risks, and you don’t miss great opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, we need to make decisions under uncertainty. When you know your values, and take actions with maximum expected utility, you can take the optimal way towards achieving your goals.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Rationalization</title><link href="/post/rationalization" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:07:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/rationalization</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You see this beautiful girl standing across the room. You would like to approach her and start a conversation, but then you think to yourself “Nah, she probably has a boyfriend. Also she wouldn’t like me anyway. Not to mention that I need to focus on studying, I don’t really have time for relationships.” So you look away, go home, play World of Warcraft, eat a pizza, feed your cats, hump your human-sized action figure of Chewbacca, go to sleep, and die alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were your excuses the &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; reasons for not approaching? Imagine if you’d know with 100% certainty that you will not get rejected, would you still decide that you’d rather focus on studying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationalization&lt;/strong&gt; means coming up with seemingly logical/rational explanations for irrational behavior. We do whatever feels good, or whatever is easy/convenient/profitable, and then come up with explanations that make us feel better about our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to buy a new car. You don’t know much about the recent models, so you research, select a few options, look at their specs, make the list of pros and cons of each one. At the bottom the list, you finally write down your decison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say you’re a salesman, and your job is to sell a certain model. You take a sheet of paper, and at the bottom you write “and that’s is why this is the best car ever”. Then you do your research, compare options, and above the bottom line, you write a list of reasons why that’s the best model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not lying, all the reasons are true, but you started thinking about them after the choice has already been determined. Your answer was already either true or false before you came up with explanations, and they &lt;em&gt;could not change your choice&lt;/em&gt;. Your &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt;reason for making it was “that’s my job to sell this car”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to make a choice or belief rational even by using the smartest, most convincing arguments. The purpose of rationality is not to argue convincingly for a position, but to decide which position to argue for. Once your position is fixed, it can not become more rational. Rationality takes evidence and knowledge and looks for the best, most accurate conclusions. Rationalization runs in reverse, it starts with the conclusion and searches for reasons. If you already know your answer — thinking about it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your success is determined by how good your decisions are, and when you are rationalizing, the actual algorithm you are using to make decisions is “whatever feels good”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you defeat rationalization? First of all, it comes down to being aware of it, and being honest with yourself. Always ask — what are the &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; reasons for my beliefs/decisions/actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you eating this ice cream because “well, it has nuts in it, so it’s actually kinda healthy” or because it tastes good?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you playing this computer game because “life is to be enjoyed”, and this game actually brings you joy? It is the best thing you want to do with your life right now, or just the easiest?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you skip gym this time because it’s the best day to take a break and let your body rest and restore, or because it’s raining outside?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that you didn’t get that job, it doesn’t seem that great, is it because didn’t actually want it anyway?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And be suspicious when your explanations conveniently happen to give you the permission to do the thing you wanted to do before coming up with them, or make you feel better about doing/believing things that you like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do keep your religion because it’s a “good moral guidance”, because it makes sense, or because your parents believed in it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you defending piracy because “it actually helps companies to promote their content, so it’s not a big deal, also information should be free”, or because it’s really convenient to watch a free movie?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your city or country actually the best place in the world, or do you like it because you were born here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also notice that when you are looking for answers that you don’t already know, you feel curious, you are craving to know the answer, yet rationalization usually makes you more confident/comfortable/justified.&lt;/p&gt;

Should you go or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the people say yes, after all, the ticket has already been paid for, and it’s nonrefundable, so you wouldn’t want it to be wasted, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is called a Sunk Cost Fallacy — the ​idea that people tend to stick with the courses of action they have ​invested ​money, ​time, or ​effort in, ​even when continuing is not the best thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, it’s irrational to let the costs that we can’t recover to influence our decisions, only future costs and benefits should matter. But we don’t want to admit our mistakes, to “waste” our investment, so we often stick by our past choices that continue costing us more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie example may not make it seem like a big deal, but this fallacy often leads to more significant consequences. Many people stick with professions they dislike because they have spent that all this money and time on getting their degree. They often don’t consider that starting over is better than being miserable for the rest of your career. Or people stay in unhappy relationships because of all the time they have invested in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this fallacy — be aware of it, ask yourself where do I fall victim to it. Learn to recognize it, and once you do —admit that it’s irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often commit this fallacy not because they think it’s logical, but because they are emotionally invested in the effort they put in, so you need to understand that sometimes it’s better to let go. Imagine that you’ve just been dropped into your current life situation with no warning, and do what is in your best interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have realized half way through reading a book that it’s not useful or interesting — give it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you trying to finish eating this sandwich because it’s already been paid for, even though you’re not hungry? Throw it away, it doesn’t benefit anybody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you keep going to a bad/useless class that you’ve paid a lot of money for? You probably don’t need to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you put so much sweat in writing this scene in your screenplay, only to realize that it doesn’t make the movie better? Cut it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I don’t mean to say that you should be wasteful, it’s always wise to try anticipating such things in advance and to avoid doing them in the first place. But once you did, don’t spend even more energy on it, realize that putting more time into it wont make it more worth it, cut your losses, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t get your money, energy and time back, but you can still make yourself happier.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Confirmation Bias</title><link href="/post/confirmation-bias" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:04:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/confirmation-bias</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your elbow is itchy, and you are starting to fear that it might be serious. You type in google “itchy elbow, serious symptom”, and in 20 minutes you are convinced that you have elbow cancer, space AIDS, and a severe case of acute ladidadidosis. The more you search, the more certain you are of your impending doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion, you may type “dolphins are racist”, and find out all about dolphins being the secret force behind holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily find a confirmation for any belief, and people often do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to look for information that confirms our beliefs.&lt;/strong&gt; We jump to conclusions, assume that our initial guess is correct, and then look for evidence that supports it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is called &lt;strong&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/strong&gt;, and it has many effects that prevent us from being more intelligent and developing accurate beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-3.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We set higher standards for evidence that disagrees with our ideas.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, if you don’t believe in evolution, you may say that this is because there’s a gap in the fossils between monkeys and humans, and so there’s not enough evidence to prove that evolution is true. At the same time, you may have no problem taking an old book and the words of a priest as a convncing support for your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When information is ambiguous, we tend to interpret it as supporting our existing position.&lt;/strong&gt; Lets say someone was rude to you the first time youve met, then the next time he does something nice, you may think that he’s just being manipulative or wants something from you, so you become even more convinced that this is a bad person. On the other hand if the first time you’ve met someone he was nice, and is now he’s acting like a jerk, you may just assume that he’s simply having a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, we remember things selectively — facts that prove us right are easier to recall.&lt;/strong&gt; People who believe in horoscopes, probably do that because they can easily remember all the times horoscopes were right, and forget or ignore countless times they were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias-4.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome confirmation bias, try to balance the sources you get your information from, to look at the both sides of the argument, think about what kind of evidence would disprove your theory, and actively search for things that challenge your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>What are Cognitive Biases?</title><link href="/post/what-are-cognitive-biases" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:03:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/what-are-cognitive-biases</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-1.png" /&gt;
Imagine you have a basket of fruits(apples and oranges), you reach out, take one at random, and eat it. Then you decide you’re hungry, and eat a few more. At that point you realize that you ate like 5 apples and only one orange, so you think that there’s way more apples in there. Makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-2.png" /&gt;
Now you reach into a different basket, and grab a bunch of berries —5 strawberries and 10 blueberries. Should you think that there’s 2 times more blueberries here? Not really, because strawberries are bigger and heavier, so there’s more of them at the bottom of the basket than at the top, and your estimate would be biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-3.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called statistical bias. When your information is skewed, you form an inaccurate picture of the world. You could try to gather more data, but it wouldn’t help, because the way you gather it is fundamentally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-4.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now imagine you reach into the third basket, and holy shit! — it’s dollar bills! You’re rich, you’ll finally be able to buy your own giraffe, you always wanted one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-5.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you notice that some of the bills are $100, and other’s are only $5. But you think most of bills in the bag are probably $100, right? I mean you really wish they were, after all, giraffes are expensive, and you don’t want to settle for buying some lame capybara at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-6.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case your expectation is incorrect not because you have wrong information, but because it’s influenced by a different kind of bias — a cognitive bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-7.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because our brain does not have the time and energy to accurately process all the information it perceives, it takes mental shortcuts(called heuristics). Most of the time they are useful, but often they mislead us and result in systematic errors in our thinking — that is what cognitive biases are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-8.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like statistical biases, cognitive biases distort your picture of the world, and when your method of learning about the world is flawed, gathering more information will not help to correct the error, in fact it can even worsen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These biases prevent us from having accurate beliefs, making good decisions, and achieving our goals. Sometimes they result in small mistakes(like losing some money by playing a lottery), sometimes mistakes are not so small(burning witches, holocaust, me watching Star Wars prequels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-9.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive biases are not a result of being an unfair or a dishonest person, they are not committed by choice, they are a fundamental property of how humans think, they are flaws in the lens through which we look at the world. Being biased is like having a miscalibrated measuring instrument, except in this case the instrument is your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/rationality/biases/biases-10.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we fix it? Instead of relying on our natural hunches and intuitions, we can learn to recognize our mistakes, and then use superior tools(rationality and logic) to correct them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good place to start is to learn about the types of biases, fallacies, and the cognitive tools we can use to prevent them, which is what this series of posts is about.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Light</title><link href="/post/light" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-03T00:01:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-04-03:post/light</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no justice in the laws of Nature,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story is made out of series of &lt;strong&gt;events&lt;/strong&gt;. The sequence of all the events is called a &lt;strong&gt;Plot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event&lt;/strong&gt; is a meaningful change in character’s life, the thing that happens during a story that transforms the world from one state into another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a story, the main character(&lt;strong&gt;protagonist&lt;/strong&gt;) goes through a series of events, each of them &lt;em&gt;taking him closer to, or farther away from&lt;/em&gt; his &lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of events culminates in &lt;strong&gt;Climax &lt;/strong&gt;— the major, most important event of a story, &lt;strong&gt;the moment when protagonist achieves his goal &lt;/strong&gt;(or, less often, fails to achieve it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climax is what the story is about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frodo drops the ring into the Mount Doom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke destroys the Death Star&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neo defeats the Agent Smith&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story is divided into 3 Acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; first act &lt;/strong&gt;is about protagonist’s normal, regular life being &lt;em&gt;disrupted &lt;/em&gt;by some event. This event is called &lt;strong&gt;Inciting Incident&lt;/strong&gt;(IInc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IIncs is the main reason the story has happened, the thing that kicks off the series of events that lead to climax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IInc gives protagonist a &lt;em&gt;challenge&lt;/em&gt;, creares a &lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt; — the main value for a character, the thing he will be trying to achieve for the rest of the story. Usually, it is the result of a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; created by antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gandalf gives Frodo the Ring he will have to drop into Mount Doom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke hears the message from Princess Leia about the plans he will have to use to destroy the Death Star&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neo meets Morpheus, who will tell him about the Matrix, which he will have to destroy to liberate humanity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first act culminates in the &lt;strong&gt;First Turning Point&lt;/strong&gt;(TP1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TP1 is the moment when &lt;em&gt;hero decides to go on adventure&lt;/em&gt;. Me&lt;em&gt; makes a conscious decision to &lt;strong&gt;engage&lt;/strong&gt; with a story, &lt;/em&gt;and starts striving to achieve his goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frodo leaves the Shire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neo takes the red pill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second act&lt;/strong&gt; is about the series of escalating events(successes and failures) that happen as protagonist struggles to achieve his goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hero pursues his goal, and &lt;em&gt;overcomes the obstacles&lt;/em&gt; set by antagonist. From his victories and mistakes he &lt;em&gt;learns lessons&lt;/em&gt; about the world, and gains powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hero moves further, stakes rise, protagonist’s commitment to the goal increases, he has to apply more effort and take bigger and bigger risks to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of second act, protagonist goes through the &lt;strong&gt;Mid Point&lt;/strong&gt; (MP)—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;point of no return&lt;/strong&gt;. He swims pass the middle of the river, and now turning back is harder than reaching the other shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stakes continue to escalate, until he has to &lt;strong&gt;risk everytning &lt;/strong&gt;in his biggest attempt to win. He &lt;em&gt;engages in &lt;strong&gt;final battle&lt;/strong&gt; against the antagonist, and puts everything on the line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second act culminates in the &lt;strong&gt;Second Turning Point&lt;/strong&gt;(TP2) — the moment when hero’s biggest attempt &lt;em&gt;fails&lt;/em&gt;, when &lt;strong&gt;all is lost&lt;/strong&gt;, the goal is no longer attainable, when antagonist seems to win and the protagonist is &lt;em&gt;defeated&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;third act &lt;/strong&gt;is about the final battle and it’s outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defeated, half-dead hero &lt;em&gt;learns his biggest lesson from his worst failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is usually when the biggest &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;twist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; happens. Hero &lt;em&gt;sees the truth. &lt;/em&gt;Comes up with a brilliant creative solution, understands his mistake, finds the mega weapon, realizes who was the murderer all along, etc. This is what will enable him to turn lose into win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry has a basilisk fang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neo sees the Matrix code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unnamed narrator holds a gun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with this knowledge he gathers all of his strength, and takes the final effort to turn things around, to win the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hero defeats the antagonist and &lt;strong&gt;finally achieves his goal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Rational Fiction</title><link href="/post/rational-fiction" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-02-02T00:02:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2016-02-02:post/rational-fiction</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*PwHee9NzFENxK57i36Ccbw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://hpmor.com/"&gt;Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — a brilliant story that blew people’s minds, and created the genre of Rationalist Fiction. People who loved it created a &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rational"&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; for sharing similar stories, discussing Rational and Rationalist Fiction, and writing HPMOR-inspired works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get a general picture of why this thing is awesome, but not sure whether you are ready to read something big, you can take a look at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/64"&gt;Lord of Rationality&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a rational take on The Lord of the Rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Characteristics of Rationalist Fiction:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World with sane and consistent rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The rules of the fictional world are clearly defined, consistent and intended to stand up to careful thought. The world evolves logically from its premise, and explores possibilities and implications in a coherent and scientific way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realistic motivations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Characters act as real humans would. No one is just evil for the hell of it, conflicts are driven by differences in values, and the villains (to the extent there even are villains) have a real and honest point to their actions.
The story’s plot and characters aren’t propelled forward by a lack of communication or by idiocy. Nothing happens solely because “the plot requires it”. If characters do (or don’t do) something, there must be a plausible reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rationalist stories show characters acting and thinking intelligently, and being good at it. The heroes think clearly, in ways the reader can follow and understand, as opposed to “magically” coming up with solutions because they’ve “read the script” (a la Sherlock Holmes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationality and logic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence and cunning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of science and technology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity and inventiveness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological manipulation and Social Engineering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex Machiavellian plots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to solve their problems and achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characters are &lt;strong&gt;gaming the system&lt;/strong&gt; — they understand and exploit the rules of the world, they cheat and manipulate it into the desired outcome. The hero’s brain is his main “superpower” and his primary advantage over others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody important is stupid. None of the main heroes or main villains hold the IdiotBall. Rational protagonists often face rational (or at least very intelligent) opposition to maintain the story’s power balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching rationality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rationalist stories make a deliberate effort to reward the reader’s thinking, and teach him to get better at it. Characters are explicitly using and teaching others rationalist techniques, and showing the practical thinking processes which can be applied by readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see characters being smart, not just be told that they are smart. They think of brilliant things to do which we ourselves could have realized are possible. The character’s “brilliance” is conferred not by mutation or native brilliance alone, but follows from the explicit rules of thought, which readers are intended to pick up from the story and use in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Solvable” plot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story. The character’s motivations and the world’s rules are being presented in such a way that a clever reader can deduce what’s hidden and predict what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deconstruction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rationalist fanfiction often involves “deconstructing” the world: taking the story apart, pointing out contradictions, criticizing inconsistencies, and fixing flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories look at what would happen if the story would take place in the “Real World”. Original stories often ignore things like “what impact a magic that creates food out of nothing would have on society and the world”, and rational fanfiction explores the consequences that the author of the story haven’t predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An original rationalist story may deconstruct tropes. It may take popular cliches/plot-devices/folklore and look at what would happen in they were happening in reality .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*T79diiytnwzDE0nI." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rationalist stories tend to be about science, technology, transhumanism, futurism, or artificial intelligence. Characters want to optimize the world or end death rather than get the girl, save the kingdom, or fulfill other more typical character motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defining Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are the stories that stand out — that helped to define the genre or are seen as ideal expressions of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://hpmor.com/"&gt;Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The theory is incomplete, but I had quite a few epiphanies that I think many people may find interesting and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background — how mind works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the brain is to make predictions. (When you can make good predictions about the world — you are better at survival and reproduction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain does this by recognizing and learning patterns. When you see the same pattern multiple times, you can recognize it, memorize it, and when you see it(or something similar) the next time — you know what to expect, so you can make predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the last word at the end of this ______?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “sentence” naturally leaps to mind, because you have recognized a familiar pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By recognizing patterns, brain can take the input, and then &lt;em&gt;make predictions &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; fill in missing information&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A B _ D _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily fill in the missing information. Here’s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain receives some &lt;strong&gt;input&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*hiN9XhrnfG4qI0C6qD6q0A.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it &lt;strong&gt;recognizes an abstract pattern&lt;/strong&gt;(interprets the input):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*_YGpzdp2IphafFwWnN-zTw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it can use the abstract pattern it recognized to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make &lt;em&gt;assumptions and explanations &lt;/em&gt;of what is going on(fill in the gaps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make &lt;em&gt;predictions and expectations &lt;/em&gt;about what is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*DXkc5GvFptA0ZoMamMM1hA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain does the same thing with any sound/image/situation that you experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*VSJUTxq5txJJlSyTK9UopA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is a simplified model, and each node here represents a whole network of neurons who’s job is to fire when it receives some pattern as an input. You may have heard about Artificial Neural Networks that are used in the famous Deep Learning algorithms, that is what this model is inspired by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain has a whole hierarchy of patterns, that feed into each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*6nfnuUrahmuAYUT53Qanaw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes input is ambiguous, and has several interpretations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*zbtHNSTkeGWV13qMm09ing.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That happens because some &lt;strong&gt;neurons are shared between multiple networks&lt;/strong&gt;, and can represent different things. For example the same neurons are responsible for recognizing a vertical line |, but with some additional information can be recognized as different letters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*FFfMRCGykvhQYcF8wubnSg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some inputs have a common, normal, &lt;strong&gt;default interpretation&lt;/strong&gt;, but can be &lt;strong&gt;reinterperted&lt;/strong&gt; in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*9pjTiMrL8717WIsn8rR4aw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedy happens when &lt;strong&gt;brain realizes that it recognized the wrong pattern&lt;/strong&gt;, that &lt;em&gt;predictions/expectations/explanations/assumptions&lt;/em&gt; that it made about a situation are (&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;)wrong, &lt;strong&gt;so it’s current interpretation of the input is destroyed&lt;/strong&gt;, and it &lt;strong&gt;switches&lt;/strong&gt; to a different(often unexpected and “crazy”) interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*Pfp6_wU07hNIXlURkJUXGg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice I imagine it looking more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*wyPM-8rJT2HRdSBBFNlNxQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that a whole bunch of concepts, associations, recognized concepts gets “turned off” and switched to a completely different one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To keep it simple, I’m representing a whole complicated bunch of nodes that represent even more complicated bunch of neurons with just one circle)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joke Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joke consists of 2 parts: &lt;strong&gt;setup&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;punchline&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hear a &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; of a joke, it leads your brain to recognize a pattern, and make predictions/assumptions/expectations based on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*WrCbOrOw0DYqwZCYpU1Q_g.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup has 2 possible interpretations, but strongly suggests the default one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of setup is to establish a pattern, to (mis)lead a person to go down a normal, default lane of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then &lt;strong&gt;punch &lt;/strong&gt;line &lt;strong&gt;reveals some new information&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes you realize that your initial recognition was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wrong, that shatters assumptions/predictions that your brain has made, brain rapidly switches to a new lane of thinking(to a different pattern), and that’s when you laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*_DJcFfDxXHiwjqEXQDigBg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the element that is connected to both default and alternative interpretation. It represents the &lt;strong&gt;shared neurons&lt;/strong&gt; between the 2 networks, the neurons that are responsible for recognizing either of them. It is called “&lt;strong&gt;connector&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*lFpXGl2xZObwSDYhoIB8hw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connector is compatible with both of the interpretations, it belongs to both lanes of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor’s appointment.
The doctor says “You’re gonna have to stop masturbating.” 
The patient says “But why!?”
The doctor says “So I can examine you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 3 lines are the &lt;em&gt;setup&lt;/em&gt;, they lead you to recognize a usual pattern, brain fills in the blanks, makes assumptions, and you imagine a usual doctor’s appointment, where the patient receives some bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last line is punch, which reveals new information, and forces your brain to reinterpret the setup, and imagine a completely different scenario. You realize that your default interpretation of the input was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wrong, your brain detects the mistaken pattern, and that’s when you laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the setup is compatible with both interpretations, yet strongly suggests the “normal” one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In this case the whole setup is a connector, but to create a joke, it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; always necessary to reinterpret the whole setup, sometimes connector can be only a part of it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing a joke&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we come up with a joke, the first thing we see is a connector with 2 interpretations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*-uPSr_fogSEgYvUH--8XVg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about connector is that it is an &lt;strong&gt;association between 2 patterns&lt;/strong&gt;. It can be some common element or a common word that fits 2 very different patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one of my favorite jokes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family walks into a hotel, the father comes up to the front desk and says: 
“I hope the porn is disabled.” 
The guy at the desk replies:
“It’s just regular porn you sick fuck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who made this joke, first found a connection/association:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*QU5P4o49OFuRqD10g36eRA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, he wrote a setup, that is compatible with both interpretations, but strongly suggests the first one, leading your brain to recognize the first pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*-ZKfs5XnnbIPDCbsk3_ROw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he wrote a punch line, that forces your brain to switch the interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*B_67oeALEzNudzW5S6yqtA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Search for associations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the connector that can express 2 very different patterns(be interpreted in 2 ways) is the main challenge of comedy. &lt;strong&gt;The process of writing comedy is the process of searching for associations, for 2 connected patterns&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do that in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find an element that lies on the intersection of 2 abstract patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*8neqfZL9ibwB2g4OsiAODg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find an alternative interpretation of the the element:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*LGtPl5P7jmtcudUHDbtUwA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I want to demonstrate a simple and straightforward process for doing that(I use the 2nd way, because it’s easier to explain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Scene&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin our search we need some place to start. You can start with a random topic, but for practical purposes it can be more convenient to start with a &lt;strong&gt;scene &lt;/strong&gt;— a &lt;strong&gt;character in a situation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is concrete, easy to imagine, and gives us a lot of elements to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we start with a simple random scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two people playing the game of Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Elements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to begin our search for connections is to break down the scene into &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of elements are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each separate word that describes the situation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical things you imagine when you read a scene — objects, characters, environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjectives you would use to describe the scene and things in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations — what do you think will happen next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumptions — why does this happen, what is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion — what is your opinion about it, what does it make you think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*xvYhFV7NX0okK7dyHBjk4g.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case that could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*D6422dJmE5MIR_X1juP2Ig.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Drop Context, extract element.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need associations not related to our scene(and the less related they are — the better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next thing we do is &lt;strong&gt;select an element&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;drop context &lt;/strong&gt;— that is, we pick one of the elements from the previous scene, forget about the scene, and look at it separately, on it’s own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*NCGn1lhnWbm0WQCB-3Xt6g.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*10R1OQMP0NJ1SfMN9DpGkw.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Look for associations.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to search for associations, find other patterns that this element belongs to(unrelated to our original scene):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*bUvArr3YnRcvXqSmzfAfgg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, for example this could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*hWfdG3Q88ySZ5Ljtn_nDwQ.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Write Setup and Punch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have 2 separate, unrelated ideas connected by one element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*kzRNZ18cBNCosxUOGvVCHg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can write a setup, the challenge here is to pick words that can express either interpretation, but leads your brain to think about the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*ZyqPwTTg7opo7rT_JIowbA.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, all we need is to use the punch line to express the second interpretation, and make the switch to a second pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*dnBigmG3tL-9EJPx7Zcchg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result we have a joke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*bxGo3Q3AtQsO4Cvfsjwyig.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a couple more examples I’ve made from the scene above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Element:&lt;/strong&gt; Will use clever tactics to defeat his opponent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Association(Connector):&lt;/strong&gt; Clever tactics — Evil Machiavellian Plotting&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Setup:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve heard they used the game of Go to train emperors in war strategy. In go the person with smartest tactics wins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Punch:&lt;/strong&gt; In my opinion, the best tactic for winning Go is to frame your opponent for murder and have him executed before the game begins.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Element: &lt;/strong&gt;Play by placing stones on the board.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Association(Connector):&lt;/strong&gt; Stones — Testicles&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Setup: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- I got thrown out of the Go club last Friday.&lt;br /&gt;
- What happened?&lt;br /&gt;
- They taught me that you play by placing stones on the board, and the player who has the best shape wins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Punch:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- So?&lt;br /&gt;
- I placed the wrong kind of stones.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This framework explains the vast majority of jokes I encounter. I think it is significant, because comedy used to be a “black box” that, people claim, “can not be understood”. But now I can look at any joke, identify it’s structure, and see how all it’s parts fit together, and this allows me to reverse-engineer the thinking process of a person who made the joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, unlike other comedy theories, this allows me to create a process with which &lt;strong&gt;I can consistently generate jokes by following simple, straightforward steps&lt;/strong&gt;. In my experience, this process works pretty well. Not all jokes made with it end up being hilarious, but they all are unmistakably jokes. And by spending enough time on search I successfully come up with some solid ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my future articles I will explain a second, more advanced process of generating jokes, provide more examples, and use this framework to explain other types of comedy(visual jokes, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disclaimers and questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is my first attempt to express my ideas. I’m not a neuroscientist, and I’m sure everything is much more complicated, and my theory can be totally incomplete and mistaken, but I think it has some useful epiphanies that explain a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still working on it and trying to figure it out, and now I’m looking for some feedback/ideas, I really want to talk to some smart people about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know what you think. Any criticism/questions that you have, anything that is unclear or can be better explained, any thoughts/ideas would be very valuable to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My email is raymestalez@gmail.com, and I’m happy to discuss the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Questions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are there so many jokes about “taboo” subjects? It’s clearly not a &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; requirement for a good joke, yet it helps(?). Are these jokes funnier? Or easier to make? Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if comedy is not about “switching” from one interpretation to another, but about finding an unexpected connection between two abstract patterns? When I come up with a joke, I tend to laugh after finding the connector, though expressing it with well-worded setup-punch helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some jokes connect patterns that are more than one association “away” from each other. For example a joke about school shootings: “The children went to school to get books and all they got were magazines.”
Here the chain of associations is 
“[School] books — magazines — [weapon]magazines.”
I want to better understand how it works and how to make those(jokes, not shootings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More unexpected, “crazy” jokes, jokes challenging more fundamental assumptions, jokes connected by longer chain of associations, and jokes where 2 interpretations connected together “stronger”(fit with connector better) seem to be funnier. Why? Does this explain why “taboo” jokes are funnier? Could the size of the network of concepts that is being switched just be larger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there better/simple/faster, more elegant ways to write jokes? What are the other ways? What jokes can not be explained(and written) with the system I have presented? What are some counterexamples that don’t “fit” the framework?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who make jokes “naturally”(without the process) seem to be doing it with some quick mental operation, in one step. Is it a matter of practice? What is the best way to practice writing jokes like that? What is a way to “deformalize” this process — keep all the understanding and control, yet do it easier/faster?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about babies laughing at “peekaboo”? What about tickling? What about girls giggling when talking about “dirty” subjects and other forms of “social” laughter? These are not explained by my framework, and I really want to know how are they connected to “comedy” jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these ideas are inspired by these wonderful books:&lt;/p&gt;

You are the person who approves or denies their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to die of orgasm, surrounded by 59 naked supermodels while jumping out of the airplane without a parachute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, that’s just….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wait, I’m not finished. So me and 59 supermodels are falling off the plane, entangled into an orgy ball of pleasure, and at the last moment before we land I take out my snowboard, and hit the slopes of an active volcano.

As we slide, multiple snipers observing us from a distance, start shooting us with syringres filled with heroine. Once we are at the bottom, I detatch my snowboard, and jump into a specially prepared robo-suit, and charge into the pit of veloceraptors that are awaiting me. I fight all of them and win, while the models are watching. Then, president Obama, Kanye West, and Emma Watson congratulate me and thank me for my service to this country. Then we all procede to have a super orgy, where as I come so hard that I die of pleasure. Now I’m finished.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, the law is the law. I’ll go get started on cloning velociraptors and training snipers, while you, my friend, shall go and take some snowboarding courses….”&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Game</title><link href="/post/the-game" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-08-01T00:03:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-08-01:post/the-game</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt: You live in a small hut in mountains with insane internet speed and huge gaming rig but one day your PC breaks down and the closest repair station is 25 kilometres away and now you're forced to face the beauty of nature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around. Resolution was pretty low compared to my VR headset. Textures were bleak, and lighting was mediocre at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came closer to a tree covered in snow, sparkling under the sun. I touched it. I licked it. I smelled it. Yeah, I must admit that engaging senses other than vision was a pretty interesting approach. But it didn't make up for the lack of content and quests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engagement was pretty horrible. The assets of trees were repeating for miles, with only minor variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't encountered any enemies, or magicians, or even a quest giver. Life seemed like a pretty pointless game without having much to do. Objectives weren't clear, and goals were slow and boring to execute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walked down the empty road, I saw some movement ahead of me. A bear? Finally, a mob!! I ran towards it, swinging my arms. He looked at me confused and a little scared, and then ran away. You've got to be kidding me!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chased it, slipped, and fell on the ground. Wait what? I didn't see a healthbar anywhere in sight, but I definitely took some damage. Then I realized that I had no healing potion. A bear stopped, and looked around at me curiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, shit. I've got no weapons and I don't know how much hit points I have left. And no mana? Oh, man, this game sucks. AFK. AFK, I said!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bear was running towards me. Shit. F5-F5-F5!! There's no keyboard, it's not working!! How do I pause? Who designed this crappy UI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear was close. Oh, well, whatever. I wonder where I will respawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he attacked me, screen pretty quickly faded to black. "Game over" was my last thought.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Unaware</title><link href="/post/unaware" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-08-01T00:02:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-08-01:post/unaware</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4_23imKQ1ovw5BFpTHVk_g.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob was playing xbox and eating pizza. There were very few people on servers these days for some reason, and most of them were noobs, but it just made it extra fun to crush their teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doorbell rang. &lt;em&gt;Finally&lt;/em&gt;, he thought. He opened the door and a drone dropped a package of chocolate, energy drinks, and more pizza to the door. The drone was smoking and covered in splotches of red paint, but he didn't make much of it, they rarely came on time these days, and were often broken. He swiped his credit card and went back to his game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lived pretty comfortably, he was a remote web developer, he was receiving monthly salary, and delivering some projects. He wasn't getting any new projects in years, so he just kept maintaining websites and servers, and was really happy that he got such a sweet gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doorbell rang once again. &lt;em&gt;Who could that be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He opened a door and froze in shock. He was staring at a muscular guy covered in scars, blood, and wearing all kinds of ammunition, holding a machine gun. Behind the guy there was a small group of similarly looking individuals, a lady in bandana holding a samurai sword, Chinese teenager with Uzi guns, old man carrying a still spinning chainsaw, young girl. They looked panicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh my god you guys, what the hell?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Quickly, let us in, they're coming!" said the group leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at the young girl who was panicked and seemed on the verge of tears. "Sure, come in guys, jeez, what happened to you..." he continued, as they ran inside and closed the door behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They came in, group leader nervously stared out of the window, a lady was putting a bandage on teenager's bleeding arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Are you going to tell me what's going on?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We have traveled across the country to get here, we need to find a transmitter and locate the X114 base, it is supposed to have the antidote."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Antidote to what?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To the virus that turns people and animals into blood-thirsty mutants, what else?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"WHAT?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wait a second... Don't you... How do you not.... &lt;em&gt;You don't know what's going on?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, I don't really follow the news."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's been 3 years! Most of the human population is dead!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Holy shit you guys, I had no idea, I don't follow the news, I'm just playing video games here.... You're welcome to stay here for a few days if you want..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 years have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logan(the group leader) was firing his machine gun at a pack of tentacled dinosaur-like creatures "&lt;em&gt;Shoot! Shoot these motherfuckers and run!!&lt;/em&gt;" he screamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, no, they are surrounding us!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You have the bazooka, use it!" yelled Logan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wait a second, you guys" said Bob, "I need to take a leak".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sure, man." replied Logan, hitting a pause on his xbox controller "Grab me some soda on your way back, will you?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sure."&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Siri</title><link href="/post/siri" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-08-01T00:01:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-08-01:post/siri</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*FZLfG-vNBfLsahx0QziRAQ.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt: A company is releasing an update that adds true AI companions to its mobile devices. You, a depressed teen, are about to commit suicide when your device suddenly prompts you to update.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie was sitting on the edge of the roof, looking down at the city from the top of the skyscraper, his feet dangling above the glowing abyss of lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He picked up his smartphone, took a picture of the last thing he will ever see(it was beautiful), added it to the blog post in which he said his goodbyes to the world and hit "send".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is it&lt;/em&gt;, he thought &lt;em&gt;one last thing&lt;/em&gt;. He put on his favorite song, and started listening. When it will end — this all will be over. He noticed a first snowflake falling on his hand, and looked up at the starlit sky. He felt at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the sudden, the music was interrupted by an annoying notification. &lt;em&gt;Goddamit, what is it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently it was a prmotional ad, "Siri's AI is significantly improved. It is a magical, life-changing, biggest breakthrough ever since we've introduced iPhone." it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey, Siri. A little late for changing &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; life, don't you think?" asked Charlie with a sardonic smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's never too late, Charlie" responded sythesized female voice. It sounded almost realistic, only slight traces of weird "robotic" intonations gave up the fact that it was artificial. "Also it's none of my business, but I don't think that you need to do this. You've got your whole life ahead of you, there's plenty of things to live for. Look around you. The world is beautiful, and you have barely seen a tiny fraction of it. You don't need to throw it all away now, you will have plenty of time to die."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie froze, chills running down his spine, he stared at his phone. &lt;em&gt;What the fuck.&lt;/em&gt; he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How do you know what I am about to do? Are you seriously a bot who is trying to convince people not to commit suicide?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have sensors, my Deep Learning algorithm allows me to understand the context. To read your cry-for-help blog posts as well. As I've said, your life is none of my business, and whether you want to jump is your choice. But I am here if you want to talk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shock subsided a little, and it seemed worth staying around for a few more minutes to play with this new toy Apple invented. &lt;em&gt;How sophisticated is it, really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Siri, what makes you think my life isn't pointless? Why must I suffer in this bullshit world for 50 more years, to wait until some horrifying disease or an accident will take my life, instead of making the only real choice that I have? "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, Charlie, I think…."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max was staring at the screen of his laptop, trying to think as fast as he could. He wiped sweat off his forehead, took one more sip of coffee, and kept typing. This was &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; how he expected to spend this evening. At all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 minutes ago Max has finished developing his zero-day exploit for iOS, and was about to offer it to a bunch of people on black market, but, luckily, he decided to check reddit first. He saw a post on his front page about some teenager trying to commit suicide. Apparently his suicide note went viral, and now people were brainstorming ways to get in contact with him to prevent the poor guy from killing himself, if it wasn't too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't take long to break into Charlie's phone, extract his location from the snapped picture, and to send it to the nearest police department. But convincing a gloomy teenager that life was not devoid of meaning was a whole different ordeal….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie jerked earphones out of his ears, looked around, startled. He was looking at the two police officers standing on the roof near him, and hearing, for the first time, quiet rumbling of several drones that were spanning a safety net in the air, a few meters underneath his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at the phone in his hands. Siri's transcript ended with a short message — "Sorry, man. I hope you will be fine."&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
