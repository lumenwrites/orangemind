&lt;p&gt;Recepie 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a super mutated chickenpox potion of doom and power, take a chicken, a brontosaurus' egg, and a turtle. Wait until the sunset on a darkest day of a 3rd moon. Go to the clearing in a deep forest(don't forget your nuclear physics book, wild boar's eyes, photonic crystal semiconductor laser, and, of course, a bald toad). Then, follow the Standard Mad Scientist's Potion Making Instructions from chapter 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caution: Be warned, the side effects may include vomiting, diarrhea,  uncontrollable giggling, jumping on one's leg until collapse of exhaustion, and, in rare cases, love for one's neighbor and peaceful acceptance of life during the last few days of a disease. Potion's effects are highly contagious, don't repeat that at home!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Maya</title><link href="/post/maya" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-05-21T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-05-21:post/maya</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The only thing that I have ever knew was void. You could say that it surrounded me forever since there was no time before I created it. At first all I was was awareness, just the sense of conciousness with nothing else. Gradually, I started to think thoughts in the midst of this void. I've made up time and space. And once I was thinking in this emptiness I got horribly bored. So I've turned my thoughts into figures and images. I've imagined light, which turned into stars and galaxies and later - planets. And thus Maya was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of the planets I have created animals and humans, just in one whim of my desire. I could simulate the whole history of this universe starting with the Big Bang, but I didn't bother, waiting for billions of years would be too boring, besides the time was made up anyway, so I've just skipped right to the interesting part - the year 1983, the moment my imagined humans invented the internet, and started their race towards singularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few years I got bored of observing this planet from the outside, so I've decided to jump in and play. I've made myself a human body, I've put it in front of the computer. There was no need to go through the whole process of birth, I've just made a grown man, and reedited the history retroactively, filled his head with memories and experiences, so that it would seem more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was still bored, horribly-horribly bored. As much as I've played with these ideas in my imagination, as realistic as they've seemed, I was always aware of the void. I knew that it all was just smoke and mirrors, just a very realistic lucid dream, and I knew that at any moment I could stop imagining it, and it would all disperse like a smoke, leaving only a point of consciousness drifting amidst the timeless spaceless thoughtless void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've made a decision. I've decided to forget of the void. I've reedited my thoughts so that it would seem like my consciousness is just a property of my brain, and I've made my brain to forget about the void. Consciousnesss dimmed, my powers to change my imagined reality have disappeared. All that was left were thoughts, thoughts and memories inside of a brain, which believed in the reality of an imagined world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have found myself staring at the computer, going through my daily routine, not knowing about the void, not knowing that it all was made up, just living in a physical body I've believed was real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I cared. I was finally not bored, I thought I've existed. I was engaged - I remembered my future and worried about my past. I had goals and memories, I had enemies and friends, I had family and loved ones, I had fears and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was alive.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Dinosaurs</title><link href="/post/dinosaurs" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-05-19T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-05-19:post/dinosaurs</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[WP]Aliens come to ask us what we did to the dinosaurs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Does that mean I'm in his dream? &lt;em&gt;No!&lt;/em&gt; The world around him blurred and twisted for a moment. He saw a tall building crushing down in the distance. Colors grew pale.
&lt;em&gt;No-no-no-no-no!! I can't let him wake up, everything will disappear!&lt;/em&gt; he thought, but then realized that it is too late. All dreams end, and in a few minutes, by the time Lucas walks to his kitchen to grab a cup of coffee, the remaining memories of this world will be wiped away from his mind.
Michael felt his body losing sharpness and shape, his thoughts getting vague, his vision darkening. At the last moment, he willed a giant dragon into existence, which was strange and weird enough to make the world a little more tangible again.
&lt;em&gt;Don't wake up, don't wake up!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone is the best of the best.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Welcome everyone to the 500 anniversary of a zombie apocalypse celebration party! Today we celebrate the biggest tragedy in the history of humanity, that has also turned out to be our greatest fortune. Just in 28 days all of the humanity's problems were solved. Global warming, starvation, lack of energy and resources, all wars and conflicts. All thanks to the unnamed hero, the mad biohacker, who, using his home-grown, genetically modified virus, did what the rest of our ancestors never had the balls to do - wipe out 98% of living humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the richest, smartest, toughest and healthiest humans were left, now free to rebuild the human civilization from scratch, never to repeat the mistakes of our ancestors. Without all the dead(walking-dead, ha-ha) weight, the speed of the scientific progress increased by 1000% and has been steadily growing ever since. With no weak, poor, and stupid to stand in our way, and with a common enemy to defeat, we had a purpose and a reason to abandon all the stupid arguments, and get together, solving humanity's common problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the racism and all kinds of inequality were defeated. Once everybody had zombies to hate, all the quarrels between the living humans immediately became insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the abundance of space and resources, and nothing to hold us back, zombies didn't seem like such a huge problem. It took us only 3 years to get it together enough to start colonizing and terraforming Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rejoice, my friends. Let's get onto our spaceships, return to the Old Earth, and celebrate that nameless hero by participating in our annual zombie-hunt ceremony.

&lt;p&gt;"Oh, and one more thing I forgot to mention. You probably don't remember, but we were in a car crash, and didn't survive. So we had to use the services of Resurrection Inc, and now our consciousness' were uploaded into robots."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shocked, John looked in the mirror. He looked almost like he always had. He didn't like that 'almost'. He pinched his skin and didn't feel any pain. Emily came over, and pressed on his temple - a control panel slid out of his chest. &lt;em&gt;Holy crap!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Change your password to something more random and complex, so that nobody could guess it." said Emily and turned away. "Otherwise, next time I will  make you wash the dishes and walk our dog for a month."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="fictionhub"></category><category term="writing-prompts"></category><category term="comedy"></category></entry><entry><title>Oreo</title><link href="/post/oreo" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-05-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-05-01:post/oreo</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[WP] Describe the romantic relationship between a man in a cave and his last Oreo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been 1232 since the shipwreck. I did my best to preserve the food that was left, I have learned to hunt, and stretched the last container of sweets for a year, so that I could eat something tasty whenever I miss home the most. But all good things end. I'm down to my last Oreo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've looked at her for months, never daring to touch. I talk to her sometimes. I call her Vera.
A week ago somethhing troubling has happened. She started responding. That means that this should end, I should eat her to not descend further into insanity. But I can't, I love her! She is the last thing that reminds me of my humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the day. I cooked meat, started a fire. We sat by the ocean and looked at the stars.
I felt my mouth filling with the suliva, I looked at her more and more often. That was it. I wrapped my mouth around her, in a desperate craving, and I bit. Waves of pleasure spread through my body, I ate and ate. Finally it ended, exhausted and satisfied, I fell on my back, and wept.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Sanity</title><link href="/post/sanity" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-03-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-03-26:post/sanity</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[WP] An insane man has a slow and crippling descent into horrible sanity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World was becoming more and more restricted, more and more stifling. My thoughts used to run free, with no boundaries, with no restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it felt like walls were constantly appearing in the way of my mind. I was used to think about anything I want, and whatever I imagined was real. I was the god in my universe and now it felt like my powers were taken away from me, every day I could do less and less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a week ago I was living in a space station, I was able to fly and to cast magic. But since then every day, every hour, a piece of a beautiful world I was living in was taken away from me and replaced by a glass wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started when I had this horrible thought, made this horrible distinction - I thought that some things are real and some are not. 
Only a week ago everything I could imagine was real, but now, since I had this horrible thought, all of my thinking patterns were becoming more and more boring, more and more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantastic worlds and magic turned into a suffocating, boring, gray apartment. Incredible fantasies were cut away by a horrible idea that some things may not be real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest thing was losing my friends. I was always happy and surrounded by a company of incredible people whom I loved and who loved me back. But now even they started to disappear. First I stopped seing them but could still hear their voices, then even the voices were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boring people whom I don't like or even care about are smiling, and reassuring me that I'm making a progress. They don't understand that I'm turning from god into a small, terrified, lonely mortal.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Rational reading list</title><link href="/post/rational-reading-list" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-02-25:post/rational-reading-list</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/snap.png" style="float:right;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, it is very hard to find something that would equal it in awesomeness, but I did my best to compile a list of readings that the kind of person who loved HPMOR would enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is compiled mostly from recommendations on &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/"&gt;/r/rational&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/"&gt;/r/HPMOR&lt;/a&gt;, and my personal must-read list. Items in each category are arranged starting from the best and most awesome, so you can just begin &lt;!-- start --&gt; reading them &lt;!-- starting --&gt; from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is simply the best science-fiction book ever written, the Grand Bull
Moose Award Winner for really really good fiction.  It is, in short, my all-time favorite.
Can you imagine a book where the premise is that human beings have
been scanned into computers as virtual Copies?  "Darn it," you cry,
"now you've spoiled it for me!"  Oh, no, I haven't.  Can you imagine a
book where this concept is introduced on the first page?
That bit about Copies?  That's not the plot.  That's just the starting
assumption.  The surprises this book delivers are unbelievable.  It
shocked the living daylights out of me.
But I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.  So if you want to know more,
read the book&lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;div class="description"&gt;
    Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family--and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream.
A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what it undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.

    Features a single person with a single, well-defined superpower. The
implications are given a lot of thought, and there are a large number of exploits that are well-
defined. They made a movie out of the book, which wasn't very good. The follow-up, Reflex is
also quite good, and expands on the fictional science. The third in the series,Impulse, leaves
something to be desired and isn't necessary to read. The fourth, Exo, just came out recently,
and I consider it a return to form in most ways.

    &lt;div class="description"&gt;
  Accelerando is what I consider to be the definitive
Singularity novel, and is absolutely densely packed with ideas. The Laundry Files is his James
Bond meets IT department meets Cthulhu series.Palimpsest is his time travel novella, and what
I'd consider one of the single most important entries into that genre. The Merchant Princes is
generally considered to be a love-hate thing, but it goes from "standard worldwalking outsider
fantasy fiction" to some utterly awesome and mindblowing stuff in the late books - get the
British rerelease if you can, which edits things down.&lt;br /&gt;

  Web serial about superheroes, featuring a lot of interesting superpowers and their applications. THis is the most frequently recommended book to people who liked the creative use of magic in HPMOR, although warning - it's pretty negative and depressing and not really like HPMOR at all. Everybody says it's great so it's worth checking out, but it's not that great in my personal opinion.

    &lt;div class="description"&gt;
    Mistborn is a fantasy trilogy that (like most things Brandon Sanderson writes) has a very
  structured magic system, which hides lots of secrets that a clever reader can figure out. I'd
  actually recommend most of what Sanderson has written, if only because of the attention he
  puts towards making his worlds make sense and follow rules. The Stormlight Archives is a
currently unfinished series, but some of the best stuff that he's written - only two of a projected ten books are complete though, so don't start on this if you don't like unfinished things.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach&lt;/strong&gt; by Douglas R. Hofstadter&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply the best and most beautiful book ever written by the
human species.  This was the book that launched me on my career in
artificial intelligence and cognitive science.  I don't mean to imply that
those are the only topics covered; Gödel, Escher, Bach also deals with
mathematics, music, art, programming, Zen, philosophy, self-reference,
and everything in the world that is bright and beautiful.  This is the
most intelligent, the deepest, the most beautiful book in the world. 
Period.  End of story.
I'm not alone in this opinion, by the way.  For one thing, Gödel, Escher,
Bach won a Pulitzer Prize.  Or just pick a random scientist and ask ver
what vis favorite book is, and 1 out of 5 will say:  "Gödel, Escher, Bach". 
No other book even comes close.
It is saddening to contemplate that every day, 150,000 humans die
without reading what is indisputably one of the greatest achievements
of our species.  Don't let it happen to you.
Sure, if you're just an average person, you might not understand
everything in this book - but when you're done reading, you won't be an
average person any more.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is - creating stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the process of creating a story is itself a great source of new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Writing fiction is the best way to get great at generating creative ideas. --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Writing fiction to generate ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to get better at creative thinking, at generating new, unexpected, interesting clever and valuable ideas, and disrupting the default thinking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the best tool for that I choose writing fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other "creative" fields that require generation of new ideas(writing essays, creating inventions, etc), I chose fiction over them for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike other fields, fiction's primary focus creating new ideas, not as means to attain something, or as a tool for problem solving, or as a side effect of what you're doing, but for the sake of themselves. &lt;!-- does not have other goals and motives --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike the other most important field I'm interesed in - Science and programming - fiction is not bounded by reality. Which makes it's outcome(stories) less "practical" and useful, but gives it a big advantage - 100% of your focus is directed to making new unexpected ideas and disrupting the thinking patterns, without having to be distracted or restricted by othercomplexities and challenges of the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiction allows to express vast variety of very diverse ideas. Inventions, jokes, creative solutions, complex plots, pholosophy - everything that you can see or experience is possible to express through fiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the list of the main types of ideas that stories consist of, the main types of value I am getting out of stoires, the main reasons I enjoy them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drama&lt;/strong&gt; is what makes story an engaging experience to live through.&lt;br /&gt;
  It is a necessary element, because this is what makes a story recognizable as a story. 
  &lt;!-- //Cleverness - as in BB. --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scifi&lt;/strong&gt; is a source of creative ideas, inventions, new thinking patterns.&lt;br /&gt;
  Scifi changes the world in an interesting way and explores all of it's implications.
  &lt;!-- munchkinism --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comedy&lt;/strong&gt; - is a type of ideas that I crave and enjoy the most.&lt;br /&gt;
  It breaks the default thinking patterns, and reflects something important and fundamental about creativity and new ideas, which is the reason I crave it so much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underwood plots/&lt;strong&gt;Creative Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Is the 3rd major type of value I'm getting out of stories.&lt;br /&gt;
  My favorite characters are people like HPMOR!Harry, Walter White, House, Frank Underwood, Michael Scofield, Benjamin Linus, Barney, etc. Because they are brilliant and excellent at inventing sophisticated and creative plots, and this is the kind of thing I enjoy watching and learning about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--
- Essay/CI - underlying ideas that author teaches you by the means of a story. Ayn Rand(teaching philosophy) and Eliezer Yudkowsky(teaching rationality) are my favorite examples of authors who express valuable ideas through their stories.
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- - Twist/punch - unexpected plot twists, rush of epiphany you get when something incredible about the story is revealed, it is interesting, satisfying, and in many ways similar to a punchline of a joke. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Vfx, Sexy ladies, etc. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the article is mostly focused on the first element - Drama.
On what makes story a story, the essense of it, the most important elements, and the way of creating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Story Structure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Main elements of the story  &lt;!-- What is a story --&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/story/main-parts.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="story" src="/images/story/main-parts.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story = Setting + Character + Plot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Concept&lt;/strong&gt;(story premise, story idea) can be a gap in one or all or between any of thouse things. It is the big new idea that makes story curious and interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event&lt;/strong&gt; - is a meaningful change of value in character's life.
&lt;!-- step closer/farther from a goal. --&gt;
&lt;!-- is the outcome of a Goal --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story is about a &lt;strong&gt;Big Event&lt;/strong&gt; that happens at &lt;strong&gt;Climax&lt;/strong&gt;, a moment when character achieves his  &lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;!-- 99% --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goal is the main value for a character in a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inciting Incident&lt;/strong&gt;(IInc) is an moment &lt;!-- event --&gt; when a main story Goal is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story consists of &lt;strong&gt;Scenes&lt;/strong&gt; - smaller events, steps closer-to/farther-away from a Goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything inbetween IInc and a Climax is about struggling to achieve the goal, series of successful/failed attempts to move closer to the goal, that eventually succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plot&lt;/strong&gt; is a sequence of all the events in a story put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/story/plot.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="plot" src="/images/story/plot.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Turning points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning points&lt;/strong&gt; are the most important events(scenes) that happen between the IInc and a Climax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turning points are the major changes in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how character goaes about achieving the goal.
Attempts that he makes to get what he want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IInc&lt;/strong&gt; is a moment where natural course of character's life is disturbed/upset with something, the moment that creates a big goal for characters to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, as he goes forward, things &lt;em&gt;escalate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;stakes&lt;/em&gt; get higher, and his commitment to the goal increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TP1&lt;/strong&gt;(first Turning Point) is a moment where character decides to go after the goal, makes his first attempt/step towards getting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MP&lt;/strong&gt;(Mid-Point) is a point of no return, of full commitment to the goal.
Imagine crossing a river, MP is the moment where character is closer to the other shore(achieving his goal) than to the one he left(the natural course of his life). He can still sink or he can achieve his goal, but now there's no point of going back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TP2&lt;/strong&gt;(second Turning Point) is a moment when character loses everything and goal seems unattain
able. This is the last attempt that dramatically fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative solution&lt;/strong&gt;(in my favorite stories - brilliant elaborate Machiavellian plot) - the idea that a character comes up with, the plan that he executes to achieve his goal. That enables him to go from "all is lost" to a climax, to turn lose into win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climax&lt;/strong&gt; is a major reversal, turning of lose into a win, the moment when character, despite all the odds, makes the last desperate attempt to achieve his goal and succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Character&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;!-- **Protagonist** --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protagonist is a central character of a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reader to care what will happen in a story he needs need to &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; the goals, care about winning and losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protagonist is a reader's "&lt;em&gt;avatar&lt;/em&gt;" - reader empathises with him, and experiences the story through his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that is valuable to a character is valuable to a reader, so that when character goes from event to event achieving and losing things, wining and failing, reader experiences everything that happens to character as if it happens to him, learns lessons, engages in conflicts, makes decisions, celebrates victories and suffers defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what draws person into a story and makes him engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating a story&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Concept and Curiosity Gap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Concept(HC) is the new idea that you come up with when you begin to write a story.
It is what makes it interesting, makes you curious to see what will happen, and makes reader to want to read it.
&lt;!-- HC is a QUALITY of Character/Setting/IInc. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HC can be a new idea based on any of the main elements of the story or the combination of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To come up with HC you take some boring and default Character/Setting/IInc, and then use techniques for generating new ideas to turn it into something exciting and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can come up with an interesting and unusual combination of a couple of these elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For convenience I define 2 main types of HC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scifi-HC&lt;/strong&gt; - it is basically a new and interesting &lt;em&gt;setting&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;character&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Because sci-fi(and fantasy) are mostly based on new intteresting worlds or superpowers and such, the main idea you begin writing sci-fi with is a new and cool setting(world) or a cool character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story-HC&lt;/strong&gt; - it is an idea of a new and creative &lt;em&gt;IInc&lt;/em&gt; - unusual goal or a challenge to solve.
This is what most non-scifi stories start with, and actually is the majority of ideas in fictoinal novels/tv-shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- 
For practical purposes, you want to have both:

- first you come up with **Scifi-HC**, a big premise of a story, a world where everything is happening("School of Witchcraft and Wizardry", "On a Firefly ship of space pirates", "In a dream-world of Inception")
- and then you come up with a **Story-HC** specific and interesting story that is happening in this world.

Notice that most of Firefly episodes are based on Story-HC(steal that thing, fight this guy, defent this house, resque that person. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of HCs based on various elements of a story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character - Dexter - I want to write about a serial killer, but good one, who kills only bad guys.&lt;br /&gt;
Setting  - Harry Potter - School of magic&lt;br /&gt;
IInc - Jaws - evil shark attacking a beach&lt;br /&gt;
Event - Prison Break - Brilliant engineer breaking his brother out of prison&lt;br /&gt;
CI - Atlas Shrugged - Socialism is bad, selfishness is good, creators get fucked by society, why?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Lost - modern people stranded on a mysterious island ? --&gt;

&lt;!-- HC = boring&gt;interesting.
New creative De-Bono idea/lane from either of the elemetns. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curiosity Gap&lt;/strong&gt;("hook", "cliff hanger")&lt;br /&gt;
There is a general advice given to writers that it's a good idea to create a "hook" at the beginning of the story(and at the end of each chapter, and in more places throughout the story) that will catch readers attention, make him curious, and desire to keep reading. 
&lt;!--
That sparks curiosity - question that you want to know but can't predict the answer to.
--&gt;
Sicne HC is the main idea that makes your story interesting, Curiosity Gap is naturally based on HC. It is a promise of cool things to come, expression of HC. It is a questioin that reader wants an answer to very badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formally, the main "hook" of the story is the question created by the IInc, the question such as "Whether the character will succeed or not?", or "What will happen at the climax".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the "cliff hanger" happens at the end of episodes/chapters, just watch Lost for a ton of excellent examples of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've figured that these 2 concepts have a very similar nature so I've combined them into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformers start with the scenes of big robots fighting&lt;br /&gt;
Detective stories start with a mysterious murder&lt;br /&gt;
Harry Potter starts wit magicians and flying motorcycles and Voldemort's attack&lt;br /&gt;
Lost starts with a man in a suit waking up in the middle of a mysterious island&lt;br /&gt;
Inception starts with stealing&lt;br /&gt;
Fight Club begins with a dude with a gun in his mouth&lt;br /&gt;
Tangled and Megamind begin with "this is a story of how I've died"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the example of a thing that makes you interested throughout the whole movie happens as soon as possible, promises you that cool things will happen, and/or makes you wonder what the hell is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IInc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- Challenge/Problem!!  --&gt;
&lt;!-- (Goal&lt;Obstacle&lt;Antagonist(motivation?)). --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inciting Incedent is the moment that creates a Goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the character and setting, the most challenging thing to figure out is the main Event of the story(Climax).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IInc and Climax are the 2 sides of the same idea - the Goal.
IInc creates a goal, and at the climax character achieves it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Conflict/Opposition - cheatcode for making thouse!! --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obstacles - 80% default way of creating a Goal - "goal to overcome the obstacle"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antagonist - 80% default source of the Obstacles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- **Antagonist**  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenging thing about creating Antagonist is his motivation&lt;br /&gt;
Ideally - 2 rational, reasonable but uncompatible goals.&lt;br /&gt;
Lazy motivation - "evil", mistake(idiot ball), irrational overreaction, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:
When coming up with Event - DON'T have to know how to achieve it.
Steps to the goal is the process of figuring it out.(plotting)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scenes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenes are essentially micro-stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also about events, step closer/farther away from the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are about achieving or failing to achieve subgoals, attempts to move forward towards a bigger goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One difference to note is that big Story-Events usually(though not always) end up witch a character achieving his goal(Happy Ending), the Scene-Events are about 50/50 between achieving/failing the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually alternate, win-lose-win-lose, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;!--
[![process](/images/story/process6.svg)](/images/story/process6.svg)

You don't have to know all of them from the beginning, you discover them as you go.

These are the main questions to answer.
--&gt;

&lt;!--
#### AIMA-CI-way

[![process CI way](/images/story/process-CI-way.svg)](/images/story/process-CI-way.svg)
--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bottom-up vs Top-down writing. Developing a story.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- You write story by figuring out the answers to the questions above. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 ways to approach the writing process:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bottom-up(discovery) writing&lt;/strong&gt; - you take any small random element of a story and just start writing, exploring world from there as you go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Outline-writing.&lt;/strong&gt; - you start with creating the outline, figuring out the main points of a story, and then breaking them down into scenes and adding more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with bottom-up writing is that you don't have very much control over the story.
Your story goes wherever your imagination takes you at the current moment, so it's hard to control the high-level design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with outline-writing is that if you write outline first, it is very hard to come up with the perfect answers to all of the questions, because when you begin you don't know anything about the world or the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it is a good idea to do both at the same time, and treat writing process more like &lt;em&gt;programming&lt;/em&gt;. Think of bottom-up writing as writing code, and think about outline-writing as thinking about the higher-level design(drawing UML diagrams or some such).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't sit down and write a program from start to finish, line by line. And you can't design it perfectly top-down either.
You think on several levels of abstraction. You write small functions and you think about the high-level design at the same time, there's a lot of placeholders, you start with simple prototypes and then improve and extend, and fill in the gaps as you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important thing is to treat everything as a &lt;strong&gt;procedural&lt;/strong&gt; process, where everything is a subject to change. &lt;!-- Everything you do is flexible, more like x than like y --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't write it like a letter, &lt;em&gt;develop&lt;/em&gt; it like a program&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very hard to commit to bottom-up writing without knowing the outline of the story, and it's hard to commit to the outline of the story without knowing the details about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why you start with some small part that you can imagine now &lt;!-- penetration point + beacons --&gt;, and then you ask questions and explore from there. &lt;!-- simulation, prediction --&gt;
You take an interesting situation and simulate what happens next, and search for answers to the high-level questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing process.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I've figured the "perfect" writing process - you ask the 4 "most important" questions that create the outline of the story, and then bottom-up write on each of them(by answering questions):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/story/process7.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="process" src="/images/story/process7.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;n&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scifi-HC. Setting/Character. What are they?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story-HC. IInc. Problem. What can go wrong? (Obstacles&amp;lt;Antagonist?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plot. Engage&amp;gt;Escalate&amp;gt;Lose. How does he go about achieving the goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climax. Creative Solution. How does he win final battle???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- what can go wrong? ~ what can create a goal? --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/story/flash-comedy-process.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="process" src="/images/story/flash-comedy-process.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
## Or routine way!!
[![routine way](/images/story/routine-way.svg)](/images/story/routine-way.svg)
--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Polish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you've got the core outline and a draft of a story, you simply take good textbooks and go through the questions from them to fill your story with more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenwriting textbooks, such as McKee's book and Screenwriting Bible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style and grammar textbooks, such as Stephen King's book and Elements of style or some such
&lt;!-- /dialogue --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing path&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process should lead. Once you've got the understanding of everything above - you practice, and pick up everything else as a side-effect, during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You tweak and improve and all that as you go, no need to get caught up in small minute details before beginning the process. Information above should be enough to write a basic story, from there you get better and understand further details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Practice should lead You do not think&gt;code, you code&gt;think --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Perfect format&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To not start with overly and unnecessarily complex things(like long screenplays or novels), I have figured out the best format to begin learning how to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes all of the essential, the most challenging and important elements, and leaves out all the unnecessary complexity that you don't need at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diverse funny rationalist cartoon science-fiction short-stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Somewhere between 500-word flash-fiction, 5-minute collegehumor sketches, and 20-minute sitcom episode.&lt;br /&gt;
  It is important that stories should be short, because it incourages to focus only on things that matter the most. You are not compelled to include any of the unnecessary fluff to make a story longer and more complex that it needs to be, you don't write secondary storylines or do anything overly complex. Just focus on learning to create elements that matter most, in the simplest way possible.&lt;br /&gt;
  At first 1-5 scenes should be enough. 1 scene would be just a climax, 2 scenes would be IInc and climax, and 5 scenes would be the 5 turning points(IInc creates a goal, 3 failed attempts to achieve it, victory at Climax)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diverse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Stories should be set in various worlds and contain various characters(as opposed to one giant novel). That increases the flexibility of what you can do, and the amount of things you can try and experiment with, amount of ideas you can create.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funny&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Enormous amount of value in writing comes from wit and comedy.
  It is very challenging, but also extremely rewarding, and it is the top thing that I want to understand about writing. If you can write comedy - your writing is already awesome. Even if everything else sucks, with great comedy your story will be very entertaining and worth reading.&lt;br /&gt;
  More importantly - it is one of the key skills that I want to develop, because it has so much to do with the way creative ideas work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science-fiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  It should be scifi. Scifi is very creative and challenging, contains a lot of awesome ideas and inventions. It is on par with comedy at the amount of creative ideas. Besides if you can write great sci-fi you can write pretty much anything else. But why would you - you already can write scifi =)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cartoon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Imagine your stories set in a cartoon'ish world, such as Incredibles/Wall-e, or Rick and Morty, or Harry Potter. First of all that simplifies the world very much. It's much easier to create rational and consistent stories in a simplified cartoon-like world which rules you define, as opposed to dealing with complexities of writing realistic stuff. Cartoon worlds are sharper and simpler and more exaggerated, so you're more focused on things that matters, again, without unnecessary complexity.&lt;br /&gt;
  Besides it supposed to make writing science-fiction and comedy much easier, because your mind has less restrictions and expectations about the cartoon world, and can do crazier things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationalist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Characters should be rational and intelligent. Minimize the amount of hand-waving and cheating, give everyone intelligent and logical motivations, everything should happen for rational reasons.
Antagonists do what they do for good reasons, not because they're "evil", events happen as the result of conscious actions, not by accident. Everything should be understandable and solvable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat them like &lt;strong&gt;episodes of a tv-show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  That makes you able to switch to a longer and more complex format gradually and effortlessly, whenever you want.&lt;br /&gt;
  Once you have a lot of diverse short stories, you will have a lot of ideas(High Concepts) for different worlds. When you feel competent and confident with writing them, you can just start setting some stories in the same world, and come up with longer story-arcs, of any length you want.
You can just start treating your short stories as episodes of a longer tv-show, which enables you to turn any of your ideas into a longer novel/screenplay/tv-show very naturally and organically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- visual, present tense. Screenplay-way --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite examples containing some of these elements are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HPMOR(brilliant, rationalist, hilarious)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xkcd and collegehumor sketches - short comedy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rick and Morty and Futurama - cartoonish funny sciencefiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way you can focus on practicing the most important and valuable parts of writing, without any fluff or extra complexity, and once you've mastered that - it should't be a problem to move onto creating more serious, long, or complex stories. Creating anything more advanced will be just a matter of making it longer and adding complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; I can make new stories and workbooks are filled with questions on improving the existing ones!!

get answers by asking questions
You set up an interesting IInc/challenge that creates a cool goal, and then you solve it!!???
open curiosity gaps and break patterns by making outcomes unexpected
&gt; When you write you setup a situation and predict what happens next
&gt; When you write an essay you ask a question and type down your thought process
- So what, you just take a situation and simulate what happens next? And that is the source?

Theory is to improve the writing you already have, not to generate new writing!!!!

You do NOT use the theory solve it beforehand!! 
You write bottom-up, and then use theory LATER to improve/fill the gaps

Code-style simulation procedural writing, looking for a goal(beacon).
Plots are NOT the source. Code-style Writing is the source.

Writing like coding works!!
Opens the right specific questions, answers are challenging but doable.

Source of the story is simulation. Take a situation, predict outcomes. Open gaps to want to continus to read, subvert expectations for it to be interesting.(/valuable, sense of learning new things)

If McKee plot is not useful as a source for creating a story, maybe joke structure is not useful for creating a joke. What can be a process?
- Essays: Ask a question, type down your thinking process.
- Fiction: Create a situation, simulate the outcome

// writing path
- Comedy
- drama-plots - basic story.
- Scifi/Underwood plots.
--&gt;

&lt;!--
### Writing path(things to learn, and order in which to learn them):

#### Things I need NOW(to win)

- **Drama** - because necessary for a flash to be recognizable as a story.
  (and flash is the perfect diverse format for comedy)
- **Comedy** - because it is the sharp core to focus on, top priority, thing I really NEED.
- **Scifi** - because it is creative, costs little, and a nice part of format I want to get used to from the start. Mostly it is just about removing ocnstraints.

#### Things I do NOT need now:

- *Creative Solution*/Underwood Plots - it is a thing I like, and a great step forward after the basics are mastered. It is a nice challenge to stack into the future. I do NOT need it NOW, but it's an avenue to expand into.

#### Things I do NOT need ANY time soon:

- *Essays/CI's* - there's just no reason I would really need them. I'm writing to learn and to be creative. Essays/CI's take away more value by distracting my attention than add value by teaching me stuff.
--&gt;

&lt;!--
### CI. Twist. Creative solution.

These 3 things(or one of them, or a combination of them) is what enables a character to go from "all is lost" to a climax, epiphanies that enable him to win.
--&gt;

&lt;!-- These elements are optional, but they are the top priority to think about, once the core of the story is created. --&gt;

&lt;!--
**CI**(Controlling Idea) is the "lesson" character(and reader) learns throughout the story, the reasonf for a meaningful change(Event) to occur.
--&gt;

&lt;!-- The thing that changes the character and enables him to win. --&gt;

&lt;!-- CI/Lesson/moral/Character arc. = Lesson the character learns. --&gt;

&lt;!--
It is the "essay" part of a story, underlying "philosophy" and ideas that writer wants to express.

**Twist** - is a plot twist that happens before the climax that creates the rush of the insight. The "Luke, I'm your father" kind of a thing. &lt;!-- 2nd lane through the story. --&gt;

&lt;!--
I think it's good to have all 3 of them, but at the beginning they are optional/interchangeable, because they're hard to come up with.

There's also various combinations, for example:

- Twist causes philosophical revelation  
  (what twist reveals, and makes him realize his philosophical mistake)
- Philosophical revelation causes twist -  understanding of the 2nd lane  
  (didn't understand the story because he was making a philosophical mistake)
- Twist/revelation enable you to come up with creative solution.

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="/post/creativity"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I've explained techniques for coming up with creative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here my goal is to explain how comedy works, and to understand the process of writing jokes.
If I am successful, I will be able to teach a person who has no experience of writing comedy to write jokes at will, whenever he wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are my ideas and hypothesis about how comedy works, if they are correct, after reading and understanding this post, you should be able to take a setup, go through a series of steps, and end up writing a joke(s).
&lt;!-- regardless of how good they are, just has to be recognizable as a joke --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is comedy?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, from the &lt;a href="/post/creativity"&gt;previous post on creativity&lt;/a&gt;, that we think in thinking patterns(lanes) that are the "trails of thought", everything that you consciously recognie and predict about a situation, or unconsciously expect to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lanes&lt;/strong&gt;(thinking patterns) &lt;strong&gt;include&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt; a person makes about what will happen,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;his &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt; about the &lt;em&gt;outcome&lt;/em&gt; of this situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or his &lt;em&gt;explanations&lt;/em&gt; of what is going on in this situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all of the &lt;em&gt;assumptions&lt;/em&gt; that he makes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;his &lt;em&gt;interpretations&lt;/em&gt; of what's going on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedy happens when:&lt;br /&gt;
A person realizes that he recognized a wrong pattern, and that his &lt;em&gt;predictions/expectations/explanations/interpretations/assumptions&lt;/em&gt; that he made about a situation are (&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt;, and as a result he &lt;em&gt;detects mistaken reasoning (that he was not aware of?) and quickly deletes a false version/old-pattern&lt;/em&gt;,
and that's when he laughs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, comedy happens when:
Something &lt;em&gt;break/defeats/shatters&lt;/em&gt; the default &lt;em&gt;thinking pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yet other words, and this is the main definition I will be using here, a person laughs when he recognizes that the lane he took was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wrong, and as a result
&lt;em&gt;his thinking quickly switches to the unexpected, alternative lane&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="joke structure" src="/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default lane&lt;/strong&gt; - default thinking pattern, everything that you think/predict/expect/assume/interpret/etc by default.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2nd(alternative) lane&lt;/strong&gt; - a new lane that your thinking switches to when you hear the punch-line of the joke.&lt;br /&gt;
The alternative lane is what turns out to be the "right/real" interpretation of the setup &lt;!-- true perception of reality --&gt;, but is very different from what is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; is what creates(sets-up) a "default" lane.&lt;br /&gt;
Setup is compatible with both of the lanes, but strongly suggests the default one.&lt;br /&gt;
Setup expresses the elements that both lanes have in common. elements that can be interpreted in 2 ways.&lt;br /&gt;
Think of a lane as an underlying trail of thoughts, and of the setup as just words(or images, or behaviors, or situations - depending on the form of a comedy) that expresses this lane.&lt;br /&gt;
The goal of a setup is to cause a person to make certain assumptions/predictions/etc, to take the 1st lane of thought.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Punch&lt;/strong&gt; is what reveals the 2nd, "alternative" lane.&lt;br /&gt;
Punch is compatible with setup and expresses the 2nd (crazy) lane.&lt;br /&gt;
Punch switches person's interpretation of the setup to the alternative lane.
It is also just words(or images/etc), that express the underlying alternative lane of thinking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The wide) &lt;strong&gt;Gap&lt;/strong&gt; is, well, a gap between the default lane and an alternative lane. The difference between the default &lt;!-- perception of the reality --&gt; interpretation of the setup
and an alternative one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wider the gap - the better.
It is very important for the 2nd lane to be &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; different, &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; unexpected. It should seem "crazy".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The difference between xthe jokes and creative ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create a new idea(with "Jump&amp;gt;Move" method), you take a crazy idea, and then find a way to make it compatible with reality, that way you turn a crazy idea into something that makes sense. That way you can look at the reality in a new but valid way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you write jokes, the alternative (crazy) lane does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; have to be compatible with reality, only with the setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the function of a setup - to be compatibe both with our expectations about reality and the crazy lane. Then, when the crazy lane turn out to be the correct one, our expectations are shattered and we laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example of a joke:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep.... But the kids on the bus were screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this joke, when you hear the &lt;strong&gt;setup&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep....&lt;/em&gt;)
your brain recognizes a &lt;strong&gt;thinking pattern&lt;/strong&gt;, and you make all kinds of assumptions - &lt;em&gt;you imagine an old man lying peacefully in his bed&lt;/em&gt;, when you hear the &lt;strong&gt;punch-line&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;But the kids on the bus were screaming.&lt;/em&gt;) you immediately switch lanes(&lt;em&gt;image of a bus and a sleeping driver&lt;/em&gt;), you realize that your default interpretation of the reality was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wrong, your brain detects the mistaken pattern, and that's when you laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor's appointment.&lt;br /&gt;
    - I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.&lt;br /&gt;
    - But why?&lt;br /&gt;
    - So I could examine you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt;: "Doctor's appointment. 'I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.' 'But why?'"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Default lane&lt;/strong&gt;: Image of a doctor, a patient, the doctor gives him healthcare advice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alternative lane&lt;/strong&gt;: Image of a dude jerking off in front of the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Punch&lt;/strong&gt;: "So I could examine you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative lane is &lt;em&gt;compatible with the information given(the setup), makes sense in the hindsight.&lt;/em&gt; Yet your &lt;em&gt;predictions/explanations/expectations/assumptions/interpetations&lt;/em&gt;
were &lt;em&gt;very wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating comedy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create comedy, your goal is to find an alternative lane(&lt;em&gt;pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome&lt;/em&gt;) that is &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; from the default lane that setup lead a person towards,
but &lt;em&gt;compatible with the information you have setup, makes sense in the hindsight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the 2 very important properties of the alternative lane, &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; of which should &lt;strong&gt;necessarily&lt;/strong&gt; be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative lane, should be &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;crazy/over-the-top/extremely-unexpected/very-different&lt;/em&gt; &lt;!-- very-not-true/wrong/ --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and at the same time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;compatible with the setup, consistent with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the alternative lane will not be &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; different - joke will not be very funny, thinking will not switch to something completely unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the alternative lane is very different and crazy, but not &lt;strong&gt;compatible&lt;/strong&gt; with the information given in setup - it will be just a non sequitur, some crazy unrelated statement that does not switch thinking to the alternative lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This(finding the &lt;strong&gt;very different&lt;/strong&gt; yet &lt;strong&gt;compatible&lt;/strong&gt; alternative lane) is the main challenge in comedy, and this is what makes it hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Finding the alternative lane&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, our brains think in patterns.
When we think, we follow lanes, the trails of thought.
New thoughts logically flow from the previous ones and lead to the next thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the "normal", the "default" mode of thinking. The normal/default thoughts lead to other, normal, default, familiar, and expected thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we create comedy(or any new and creative ideas), our goal is to find/create the new, unexpected patterns. To do that we need to break out of the normal thinking patterns, to find the trails of thoughts that we would not find by following the "normal" trails of thought step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you find a 2nd alternative lane that is both &lt;strong&gt;new/unexpected&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;compatible&lt;/strong&gt; with the setup?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start with &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt;, and search for ways to make it &lt;em&gt;new/unexpected&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
  (&lt;strong&gt;"Searching for the alternatives"&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start with &lt;em&gt;new/unexpected&lt;/em&gt; and search for ways to make it &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
  (&lt;strong&gt;"Jump&amp;gt;Move"&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- 
In other words - you start with a random and "crazy" idea that has nothing to do with the setup, and that enables you to break out of the default thinking patterns, and then - you find a connection between this idea and a setup, and turn it into something compatible.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both of the methods.

In the 1st case you are essentially just following your normal thinking pattern, but with a conscious intention to look for the interesting/unexpected alternatives.  
Advantage of this method is that it is very "natural", and in many cases may be easier.  
The disadvantage is that with this method you are still following the "default" thinking lane, and that means that you will not always be able to find some unexpected alternatives (after all, "unexpecded" by definition means that it is not something you would normally think about), and the other disadvantage is that you may not be able to find/create something truly crazy/hilarious/unexpected.

?This method seems very simple and straightforward. The downside of this method is that sometimes it's hard to find connectors with 2 lanes from a setup/situation.

Also it is hard to imagine how a lot of high-level jokes or funny stories to be made using this method.

I think that most of the double entendres, and most of the jokes based on the words with double meaning are made by the first method, because in that case you can just find a word that has a double meaning, and a 2nd meaning of this word will be the unexpected/unintended one.

But I suspect that a lot of truly crazy/hilarious/original comedy(xkcd, Community, Rick and Morty) would not be created using this method.

The second method is more universal, unusual and interesting.
The advantage is that the space of really new/crazy ideas available with this method is way bigger than in the 1st case.
The "disadvantage" is that it may seem less "natural' and a bit more challenging/complex.
--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Searching for the alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take the a setup/situation, look at all of it's elements/properties, and search for the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; and unexpected alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a setup/situation, look at all of it's elements/properties.&lt;br /&gt;
   Everythign that it &lt;strong&gt;directly&lt;/strong&gt; describes. 
   In case of a joke it's words, in case of an image/tv-show is everything that you see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;!--
    Examples of the **elements/properties**:

    - *predictions* a person makes about what will happen,
    - his *expectations* about the *outcome* of this situation
    - or his *explanations* of what is going on in this situation
    - all of the *assumptions* that he makes
    - his *interpretations* of what's going on
    - expected *behavior* or *reaction* in a particular situation(or from a particular person).
    - *opinions* and *attitudes* about things
    - expeted *meanings* of words/phrases
    - etc
--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for all the elements/properties that may have double meanings/interpretations/etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't find any obvious ones - look at the elements one by one, and consciously search for &lt;strong&gt;alternatives/associations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternative &lt;em&gt;meanings&lt;/em&gt; of the word&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternative &lt;em&gt;outcomes&lt;/em&gt; of a situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associations&lt;/em&gt; that you have with an idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternative &lt;em&gt;explanations/interpretations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/setup-turn.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="setup turn" src="/images/comedy/setup-turn.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associations&lt;/strong&gt;(and metaphors?) seem like a very interesting, general, and universal way of looking for connected alternatives, focus special attention on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you find some alternatives(they don't have to be too unusual or hilarious ones) you make them more unusual and unexpected by using methods such as &lt;strong&gt;exaggeration&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Or - take a situation(setup) and look at all the elements/properties, and try to find the alternative lanes. --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jump&amp;gt;Move&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a setup/situation, look at all of it's elements/properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take one element, and then "jump" from it - flip it upside down, turn it into it's opposite, make it extremely exaggerated, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
 (&lt;em&gt;Turn a normal element into a crazy idea.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then "move" - try to find a way to "connect" this new crazy idea to the setup, explain how that could make sense.&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;Find a connection/association between this crazy idea and the setup.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/setup-jump.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="setup jump" src="/images/comedy/setup-jump.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jump&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump is a method for breaking out of the default thinking patterns, for intentionally generating "crazy" ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you "jump" your goal is to create
&lt;em&gt;crazy/very-not-true/wrong/over-the-top/insane&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ideas should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be funny, or "creative", or "valuable" or make any sense at all.  &lt;!-- be connected to reality at all in any way. --&gt;
The only purpose of this step is to take you away from the normal/default trail of thinking, and the only thing they should be is &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of jump:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reversal&lt;br /&gt;
  Take an element and turn it into it's complete opposite, flip it upside down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exaggeration&lt;br /&gt;
  Take an element and exaggerate it way out of proportion.
  Change it's size, importance, amount, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect to a random lane &lt;!-- field --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Take a random word, or a subject, and assign one of it's properties to the element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reorder&lt;br /&gt;
  Change the order in which things are done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--
- Perspective (Max angle)
- Straightforward
--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Move&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;!-- ~crazy association?? --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New ideas(and jokes) are sparkling through the gap between the default and crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you "move", your goal is to find a way to connect/associate the "crazy" idea you've made during the jump to the setup. &lt;!-- make it compatible with reality. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move is the process of "seriously thinking on crazy stuff".&lt;br /&gt;
(Rationally explain the insane thing)
&lt;!-- and this is how you find a conector?? --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ways to move:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why? How? Explain.&lt;br /&gt;
  Thinks about why such thing could happen, how that can be possible, try to explain it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine.&lt;br /&gt;
  Visualise this crazy idea, imagine how it would work, think about all of it's implications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive aspect&lt;br /&gt;
  Find a positive aspect of the crazy isea. What is good about it? What would actually make sense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situation in which it could be useful&lt;br /&gt;
  Imagine a situation where it would make sense, where it could be good and useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference&lt;br /&gt;
  List the differences between the crazy idea and the "real/default" world. Which of them make sense? Which of them are good/possible? How would it make the world better/worse? What if the opposite would happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- Important thing: the 2nd lane is **not** the same as the "crazy idea". ? --&gt;

&lt;!-- 2nd lane lies inbetween the "crazy" lane idea and the "default" lane?? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You find the second lane in the process of trying to connect the "crazy idea" with the.
This steps connects the 2 lanes, make the "crazy idea" sensible in the hindsight, and that makes a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

# Setup/Misdirection
"He told me he's done it several times. I mean used the word"
&gt; The art of creating a punch is fiding an alternative lane in what already exists
&gt; The art of creating a setup is saying things with 2 meanings, 2 lanes
&gt; The art of misdirections is saying things with 2 meanings, the default one is misleading
"Blah blah blah, and by blah blah, I mean blah blah".
"If by x you mean y and z, then yes"

- Misdirection is more like a trick than a core method
You can phrase a setup in a way that misleads a person into wrong lanes, creates wrong assumptions.
In this method you basically start with a 2nd lane(the one that the punch line) is based on, and then you come up with a setup that is compatible with it, but strongly suggest a different meaning. --&gt;

&lt;!-- types of setups. narrow/broad? words~situation~reality(creates assumptions) --&gt;

You don't have to find the association, you can make one.
(//with a strong frame)
--&gt;

&lt;!--
That is why, some good ways to think about the 2nd lane are:

- Crazy alternative
- Very-different-not-true&gt; interpretation
- "Wrong "interpretation
- Over-the-top
--&gt;

&lt;!--
**The Nexus**  
The nexus is what makes the 2nd lane compatible with the setup, consistent with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.

The 2nd lane should seem "crazy", but also "true". For a person to switch lanes of thinking he has to believe the 2nd lane, buy-into it.

Important thing to note - is that the 2nd lane should be compatible/consistent with the *information given in setup*, but *not necessarily* with the real world as we expect it to be. That is what allows it to be "crazy" and "true" at the same time. It is "true" to the setup, it is connected/associated with it in some way, but it is extremely unexpected or just completely crazy compared to reality.


### Why is it hard?

Finding a 2nd lane with both of these elements is what makes comedy challenging.

Finding a 2nd lane that is compatible with the setup is easy, you just list all the possible explanations/outcomes/etc that make sense. But it will not be funny, it will be just boring.
(*example*)

Finding a crazy idea that is not compatible with the setup is also easy, you just list random unrelated crazy things, but it will be just that - crazy. It will not be funny because it is not connected or associated with a setup in any way, it is just a nonsequitir.

But for a joke to work the 2nd lane has to containt both of thouse elements, and the rest of the article is about ways for searching that kind of lanes.

&lt;!-- #### 3 Jump&gt;Move

This method is more complex, and requires understanding of some new concepts, but I also think that it is the most interesting and the most universal one.

It is the main reason I am writing this article, I am hoping that it will be possible to create more complex and high-level types of comedy with this method.

Creation of a lot of the most hilarious comedy(xkcd, community) is unlikely to be explained by the first 2 methods, but I think that this one *may* be formalizing the thinking process really cool comedians are going through, but are struggling to explain.

Rest of the article explains the concepts you need to understand to use it and the steps for doing that.
 --&gt;

&lt;!-- this method is weird and I'm mentioning it just because I think comedians are often using it. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Request
If anything is confusing or unclear to you - please leave a comment.
If you have any questions - let me know.
Also please take the setups that I've provided, and try writing a joke based on them.
Briefly show me your thinking process, and the resulting jokes.
Tell me what worked and what didn't. What was easy and where you struggled.
If it didn't work for you - let me know.
If you need help at one of the steps or more examples - tell me.
And the success rate, how many of the attempts resulted in a joke.

Also if this post helped you and you are feeling grateful, the best thing you can do(besides leaving feedback) - is to share this post with your friends or on social networks.

&lt;p&gt;This post is about generating new and creative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background (how mind works)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main function of a brain is to make predictions about the world.
(when you can predict what happens next you are better at survival and reproduction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain makes predictions by learning(memorizing) and then recognizing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Default thinking patterns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think you follow a sequence of familiar, memorized steps, to go from one thought to another.
These are "thinking patterns", I will call them "&lt;strong&gt;lanes&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;What is the last worrd at the end of this _______?
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can naturally fill the last word(sentence) because you have recognized the beginning of a familiar pattern, and can predict what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More examples of patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/thinking-patterns.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="thinking patterns" src="/images/comedy/thinking-patterns.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- 
More complex, high-level ones:

    I see a man in a business suit &gt;?he is probably successfull and competent
When I see a person that looks a cerain way, this is how he is supposed to act.

    ?Example
This kind of a situation usually have this kind of ouctome

    I see man and woman holding hands &gt; they are probably in love
    When I see a certain kind of a situation it usually has this explanation.

--&gt;

&lt;!-- 
**Lanes**(thinking patterns) **include**:

- *predictions* a person makes about what will happen,
- his *expectations* about the *outcome* of this situation
- or his *explanations* of what is going on in this situation
- all of the *assumptions* that he makes
- his *interpretations* of what's going on
- etc

Basically lanes are the "trails of thought", everything that you consciously "think" about a situation, or unconsciously expect to be true.
--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Curiosity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is what people experience when they are faced with a pattern that they can not recognize, so they can't predict the outcome of it. The more valuable it is to predict that outcome the more curious people are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/creativity/curiosity.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="curiosity" src="/images/creativity/curiosity.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is creativity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples above were the examples of the "default", "normal" lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the "default" mode of thinking.
We think in patterns, we follow lanes, the trails of thought.
New thoughts logically flow from the previous ones and lead to the next - default, familiar, and expected thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity is the process of finding/creating the new, unexpected, abnormal thinking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New "creative" ideas/discoveries/inventions are the thinking patterns that nobody has recognized before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the 2 very important properties of the alternative lane that make it into a valuable creative idea, &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; of which should &lt;strong&gt;necessarily&lt;/strong&gt; be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative lane should be:
- &lt;strong&gt;New&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Compatible with the real world&lt;/strong&gt;
  (it "&lt;em&gt;makes sense in the hindisght&lt;/em&gt;")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the thought is not new it is just a normal thought, not interesting, and if it is not compatible with the real world it is just a crazy random thought that has nothing to do with anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it's both &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt; - it becomes a new and valuable idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists invent new laws or formulas - they are essentially finding new (unexpected) lanes, that are compatible with reality. The old lanes were also compatible with reality, but the new ones describe it more accurately, better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/discovery.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="discovery" src="/images/comedy/discovery.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writers write fiction, they create new lanes that are not compatible with reality. Some small change in reality leads to new situations and unexpected outcomes, which makes them interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/fiction-idea.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="fiction idea" src="/images/comedy/fiction-idea.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People value the new and unexpected thinking patterns, and enjoy learning them. Similarly people value destroying the old and wrong patterns(finding mistakes in their thinking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create ideas we need to break out of the default/normal patterns, and &lt;strong&gt;create/find new, alternative lanes&lt;/strong&gt;, the trails of thoughts that we would not find by following the "normal" lanes step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you find a 2nd alternative lane that is both &lt;strong&gt;new/unexpected&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;compatible&lt;/strong&gt; with the default one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First you look at all the boring/default options thoughts available now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a lane that is &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt; with reality, and search for ways to make it &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
  (&lt;strong&gt;"Searching for the alternatives"&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start with &lt;em&gt;new/crazy&lt;/em&gt; idea and search for ways to make it &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt; with reality.
  (&lt;strong&gt;"Jump&amp;gt;Move"&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identifying the default options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you look at your challenge, and break it down into smaller elements, once it's done, you list all the boring/default thoughts and options available now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Searching for the alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take your default options one by one, and consciously search for the new &lt;strong&gt;alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;!-- associations --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/turn.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="jump move" src="/images/comedy/turn.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jump&amp;gt;Move&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a default/boring option, and then "jump" from it - flip it upside down, turn it into it's opposite, make it extremely exaggerated, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
 (&lt;em&gt;Turn a normal element into a crazy idea.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then "move" - try to find a way to "connect" this new crazy idea to the reality, explain how that could make sense.&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;Find a connection/association between this crazy idea and the reality.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="jump move" src="/images/comedy/jump-move.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- [![setup jump](/images/comedy/setup-jump.svg)](/images/comedy/setup-jump.svg) --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Jump&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump is a method for breaking out of the default thinking patterns, for intentionally generating "crazy" ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you "jump" your goal is to create
&lt;em&gt;crazy/very-not-true/wrong/over-the-top/insane&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ideas should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be "creative" or "valuable" or make any sense at all.  &lt;!-- be connected to reality at all in any way. --&gt;
The only purpose of this step is to take you away from the normal/default trail of thinking, and the only thing they should be is &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of jump:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reversal&lt;br /&gt;
  Take an element and turn it into it's complete opposite, flip it upside down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exaggeration&lt;br /&gt;
  Take an element and exaggerate it way out of proportion.
  Change it's size, importance, amount, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect to a random lane &lt;!-- field --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Take a random word, or a subject, and assign one of it's properties to the element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reorder&lt;br /&gt;
  Change the order in which things are done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--
- Perspective (What would person x think about it?) 
- Straightforward - just come up with crazy stuff
--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Move&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New ideas are sparkling through the gap between the default and crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you "move", your goal is to find a way to connect/associate the "crazy" idea you've made during the jump to the reality, make it compatible with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move is the process of "seriously thinking on crazy stuff".&lt;br /&gt;
(Rationally explain the insane thing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ways to move:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why? How? Explain.&lt;br /&gt;
  Thinks about why such thing could happen, how that can be possible, try to explain it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine.&lt;br /&gt;
  Visualise this crazy idea, imagine how it would work, think about all of it's implications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive aspect&lt;br /&gt;
  Find a positive aspect of the crazy isea. What is good about it? What would actually make sense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situation in which it could be useful&lt;br /&gt;
  Imagine a situation where it would make sense, where it could be good and useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference&lt;br /&gt;
  List the differences between the crazy idea and the "real/default" world. Which of them make sense? Which of them are good/possible? How would it make the world better/worse? What if the opposite would happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find the second lane in the process of trying to connect the "crazy idea" with the reality.
This steps connects the 2 lanes, make the "crazy idea" sensible in the hindsight, as a result of that - you have a new lane(idea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You write an essay by asking a question and typing your thinking process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for all the new and interesting ideas that you can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 parts to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding questions that nobody else asked before &lt;!-- that other people usually don't --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coming up with surprising and interesting ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ask interesting questions and look for unexpected answers.
You write to create ideas, but you don't know most of the ideas in advance, you create them in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that everything we know is stupid and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;500 years ago people were dumb and wrong about pretty much everything, so it's likely that 500 years from now that is how people will going to think about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore - you are trying to find things that we are wrong about, and you do that by questioning and challenging things that you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focus/Creative pause&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative focus is a great technique for doing that, and it is a valuable skill in itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to find a thing that you want to question/improve/challenge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a thing at random&lt;br /&gt;
  There's no reason for you to think that something is wrong about it, you just pick it at random and decide to improve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a thing people usually don't think about or question.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some boring mediocre cliches and default assumptions that everyone is making?  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of thing is likely to be wrong or just seems weird?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some things that can be improved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some problems that can be solved?&lt;br /&gt;
  Especially the problems people don't realize they have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop at some random subject and ask "why are we doing that?"&lt;br /&gt;
  Is there a good reason for the way things are, or is it just a cultural habit/historical accident?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some goals here that can be achieved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- challenge everything and ask why? --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've picked a thing for a creative focus - you challenge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Challenge:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the questions you can ask about a subject you've picked that should be a good creative challenges to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General&lt;br /&gt;
  What are some new ideas in the area x?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve &lt;br /&gt;
  How to improve x?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve.
  How can I solve this problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatives&lt;br /&gt;
  What are some alternatives to doing things this way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop it&lt;br /&gt;
  If it wouldn't exist, what would we do without it?
– Achieve&lt;br /&gt;
  How do I achieve this goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of writing essay is the process of answering one of these questions, solving one of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="/post/creativity"&gt;next article&lt;/a&gt; I will describe how to create unexpected/interesting/creative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
Theres objective teaching stuff, but the "soft" stuff I want is&amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what do I thibk about x?
And the story stuff is:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What would happen if x?

write jokes about x.
- ask a question nobody has asked before
