&lt;p&gt;My goal is to explain how comedy works, and to understand the process of writing jokes.
If I am successful, I will be able to teach a person who has no experience of writing comedy to write jokes at will, whenever he wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything below is my hypothesis about how comedy works, and if it is correct, after reading and understanding this post, you should be able to take a setup, go through a series of steps, and end up writing a joke(s).
&lt;!-- regardless of how good they are, just has to be recognizable as a joke --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background (how mind works)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main function of a brain is to make predictions about the world.
(when you can predict what happens next you are better at survival and reproduction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain makes predictions by learning(memorizing) and then recognizing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Default thinking patterns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think you follow a sequence of familiar, memorized steps, to go from one thought to another.
These are "thinking patterns", I will call them "&lt;strong&gt;lanes&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/thinking-patterns.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="thinking patterns" src="/images/comedy/thinking-patterns.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;What is the last worrd at the end of this _______?
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can naturally fill the last word(sentence) because you have recognized the beginning of a familiar pattern, and can predict what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More examples of patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;A B C D _ F
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(you can predict that the 5th letter is F)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1 2 3 4 _
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Wake up &amp;gt; Drink Coffee &amp;gt; ________
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Dress and Go to work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- More complex, high-level ones: --&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;I see a man in a business suit &amp;gt;?he is probably successfull and competent
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I see a person that looks a cerain way, this is how he is supposed to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;?Example
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This kind of a situation usually have this kind of ouctome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;I see man and woman holding hands &amp;gt; they are probably in love
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I see a certain kind of a situation it usually has this explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of kinds of Lanes&lt;/strong&gt;(thinking patterns):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prediction&lt;/em&gt; a person makes about what will happen,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;his &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt; about the &lt;em&gt;outcome&lt;/em&gt; of this situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or his &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; of what is going on in this situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all of the &lt;em&gt;assumptions&lt;/em&gt; that he makes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;his &lt;em&gt;interpretations&lt;/em&gt; of what's going on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically lanes are the "trails of thought", everything that you consciously "think" about a situation, or unconsciously expect to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creativity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples above were the examples of the "default", "normal" lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity is the process of finding/creating the new, unexpected, abnormal thinking patterns.
The goal of creativity is to break out of the default/normal patterns, and create/search for new ways of thikning, new, alternative lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New "creative" ideas/discoveries/inventions are the thinking patterns that nobody has recognized before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a thought to be called an "idea" it has to have 2 properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has to be new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has to be valuable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what ideas are - just thoughts that are "&lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;" and "&lt;em&gt;valuable&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists invent new laws or formulas - they are essentially finding new (unexpected) patterns, and then teaching other people to recognize these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writers write fiction, they setup situations and then show the unexpected outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People value the new and unexpected thinking patterns, and enjoy learning them.&lt;!-- (especially when they are valuable).--&gt; Similarly people value destroying the old and wrong patterns(finding mistakes in their thinking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as you will see, this process is very much related to the process of creating comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- I have a strong viceral sense that the concepts of curiosity, creativity, and comedy have something very similar with each other. Based on that theory of mind, here are quick definitions of creativity and curiosity: --&gt;

&lt;!-- Curiosity is what people experience when they are faced with a question that they can not predict the outcome of. The more valuable it is to predict that outcome the more curious people are. --&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is comedy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedy happens when:&lt;br /&gt;
A person realizes that the assumption(based on a default thinking pattern) that he made about a situation was (very)wrong, and as a result he &lt;em&gt;detects mistaken reasoning (that he was not aware of?) and quickly deletes a false version/old-pattern&lt;/em&gt;,
and that's when he laughs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, comedy happens when:
Something &lt;em&gt;break/defeats/shatters&lt;/em&gt; the default &lt;em&gt;thinking pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yet other words, and this is the main definition I will be using here, a person laughs when he recognizes that the lane he took was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wrong, and as a result
&lt;em&gt;his thinking quickly switches to the unexpected, alternative lane&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default lane&lt;/strong&gt; - default thinking pattern, everything that you think/predict/expect/assume/interpret/etc by default.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The 2nd(alternative) lane&lt;/strong&gt; - a new lane that your thinking switches to when you hear the punch-line of the joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To achieve that effect, your goal is to:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find an alternative lane(&lt;em&gt;pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome&lt;/em&gt;) that is &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; from the default lane that a person took,
but &lt;em&gt;compatible with the information you have, makes sense in the hindsight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative lane is what turns out to be the true perception of reality, but is very different from what is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Joke structure.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every joke has a &lt;strong&gt;setup&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;punch-line&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; is what creates(sets-up) a "default" lane.&lt;br /&gt;
Think of a lane as an underlying trail of thoughts, and of the setup as just words(or images, or behaviors, or situations - depending on the form of a comedy) that expresses this lane.&lt;br /&gt;
The goal of a setup is to cause person to make certain assumptions/predictions/etc, to take the 1st lane of thought.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Punch&lt;/strong&gt; is what reveals the 2nd, "alternative" lane.&lt;br /&gt;
It is also just words(or images/etc), that express the underlying alternative lane of thinking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of a joke:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep.... But the kids on the bus were screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this joke, when you hear the &lt;strong&gt;setup&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep....&lt;/em&gt;)
your brain creates a &lt;strong&gt;thinking pattern(assumption, lane)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;you imagine an old man lying peacefully in his bed&lt;/em&gt;, when you hear the &lt;strong&gt;punch-line&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;But the kids on the bus were screaming.&lt;/em&gt;) you immediately switch lanes(&lt;em&gt;image of a bus and a sleeping driver&lt;/em&gt;), you realize that your default interpretation of the reality was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wrong, your brain detects the mistaken pattern, and that's when you laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="joke structure" src="/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor's appointment.&lt;br /&gt;
    - I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.&lt;br /&gt;
    - But why?&lt;br /&gt;
    - So I could examine you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt;: "Doctor's appointment. 'I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.' 'But why?'"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Default lane&lt;/strong&gt;: Image of a doctor, a patient, the doctor gives him healthcare advice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alternative lane&lt;/strong&gt;: Image of a dude jerking off in front of the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Punch&lt;/strong&gt;: "So I could examine you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative lane is &lt;em&gt;compatible with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.&lt;/em&gt; Yet your &lt;em&gt;pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome&lt;/em&gt;
was &lt;em&gt;very wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The main challenge in comedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the description of the alternative lane, there are 2 very important points, &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; of which should &lt;strong&gt;necessarily&lt;/strong&gt; be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge in comedy is finding that 2nd, alternative lane, that is &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;crazy/very-not-true/wrong/over-the-top/extremely-unexpected/very-different&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and at the same time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;compatible with the setup, consistent with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what makes it hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence - the following 2 concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wide Gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gap&lt;/em&gt; is, well, a gap between the default lane and an alternative lane. The difference between the default perception of the reality and an alternative one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wider the gap - the better.
It is very important for the 2nd lane to be &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; different, &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; unexpected. It should seem "crazy".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, some good ways to thinnk about the 2nd lane are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crazy alternative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very-not-true interpretation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Wrong "interpretation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over-the-top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nexus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The nexus is what makes the 2nd lane compatible with the setup, consistent with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2nd lane should seem "crazy", but also "true". For a person to switch lanes of thinking he has to believe the 2nd lane, buy-into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important thing to note - is that the 2nd lane should be compatible/consistent with the &lt;em&gt;information given in setup&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;not necessarily&lt;/em&gt; with the real world as we expect it to be. That is what allows it to be "crazy" and "true" at the same time. It is "true" to the setup, it is connected/associated with it in some way, but it is extremely unexpected or just completely crazy compared to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why is it hard?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a 2nd lane with both of these elements is what makes comedy challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a 2nd lane that is compatible with the setup is easy, you just list all the possible explanations/outcomes/etc that make sense. But it will not be funny, it will be just boring.
(&lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a crazy idea that is not compatible with the setup is also easy, you just list random unrelated crazy things, but it will be just that - crazy. It will not be funny because it is not connected or associated with a setup in any way, it is just a nonsequitir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for a joke to work the 2nd lane has to containt both of thouse elements, and the rest of the article is about ways for searching that kind of lanes.
&lt;!-- ### Types of connectors --&gt;
&lt;!-- Types of connectors are similar to the types of lanes you can have. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- - Explanation --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Outcome --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Behavior --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Reaction --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Interpretation --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Assumption --&gt;

&lt;!-- - My opinion --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Meaning(word/phrase) --&gt;

&lt;!-- - //metaphor   --&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding the alternative lane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, our brains think in patterns.
When we think, we follow lanes, the trails of thought.
New thoughts logically flow from the previous ones and lead to the next thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the "normal", the "default" mode of thinking. The normal/default thoughts lead to other, normal, default, familiar, and expected thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we create comedy(or any new and creative ideas), our goal is to find/create the new, unexpected patterns. To do that we need to break out of the normal thinking patterns, to find the trails of thoughts that we would not find by following the "normal" trails of thought step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you find a 2nd lane that is both &lt;strong&gt;new/unexpected&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;compatible&lt;/strong&gt; with the previous one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for the alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can start with &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt;, and search for ways to make it &lt;em&gt;new/unexpected&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
You can take the setup/situation, look at all of it's elements, and search for the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; and unexpected alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Jump&amp;gt;Move"&lt;/strong&gt;(the reason I call it that is explained below)&lt;br /&gt;
You can start with &lt;em&gt;new/unexpected&lt;/em&gt; and search for ways to make it &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt;.
In other words - you start with a random and "crazy" idea that has nothing to do with the setup, and that enables you to break out of the default thinking patterns, and then - you find a connection between this idea and a setup, and turn it into something compatible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are advantages and disadvantages to both of the methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1st case you are essentially just following your normal thinking pattern, but with a conscious intention to look for the interesting/unexpected alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;
Advantage of this method is that it is very "natural", and in many cases may be easier.&lt;br /&gt;
The disadvantage is that with this method you are still following the "default" thinking lane, and that means that you will not always be able to find some unexpected alternatives (after all, "unexpecded" by definition means that it is not something you would normally think about), and the other disadvantage is that you may not be able to find/create something truly crazy/hilarious/unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?This method seems very simple and straightforward. The downside of this method is that sometimes it's hard to find connectors with 2 lanes from a setup/situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also it is hard to imagine how a lot of high-level jokes or funny stories to be made using this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that most of the double entendres, and most of the jokes based on the words with double meaning are made by the first method, because in that case you can just find a word that has a double meaning, and a 2nd meaning of this word will be the unexpected/unintended one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I suspect that a lot of truly crazy/hilarious/original comedy(xkcd, Community, Rick and Morty) would not be created using this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second method is more universal, unusual and interesting.
The advantage is that the space of really new/crazy ideas available with this method is way bigger than in the 1st case.
The "disadvantage" is that it may seem less "natural' and a bit more challenging/complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Searching for the alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="turn" src="/images/comedy/turn.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or - Take a setup/situation, look at all of it's elements/properties, and then try to come up with alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for things that have double meanings or 2 alternative explanations/interpretations/etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you find some alternatives(they don't have to be too unusual or hilarious ones) you make them more unusual and unexpected by using methods such as exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Search for things(possible connectors) that have double meanings or 2 alternative explanations/interpretations/etc.

Or - take a situation(setup) and look at all the elements/properties that may have double meanin/nterpretations, and try to find the alternative lanes.
 --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jump&amp;gt;Move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="jump move" src="/images/comedy/jump-move.svg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method consists of 2 separate steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a crazy but &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; idea("jump").
&lt;!-- (crazy lane, 3rd lane, not connected lane) --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a connection/association between this crazy idea and the reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a way to connect/associate/make it compatible with the reality, 
&lt;!-- make it "make sense". Find/create a connector and the 2nd lane, in the process of moving?? --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jump&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump is a method for breaking out of the default thinking patterns, for intentionally generating "crazy" ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you "jump" your goal is to create:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;crazy/very-not-true/wrong/over-the-top/insane ideas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- crazy alternative. --&gt;
&lt;!-- (comic reality? Looking for crazy.) --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ideas should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be funny, or "creative", or "valuable" or make any sense at all.
The only purpose of this step is to take you away from the normal/default trail of thinking, and the only thing they should be s &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words - completely crazy, not connected to reality at all in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Types of jump&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reversal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exaggeration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect to field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perspective (Max angle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straightforward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- example --&gt;

&lt;!-- is the step where you create an unconnected *crazy idea*, the 3rd lane. --&gt;

&lt;!-- **Move** this is where you find a connector, the *crazy association*. --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Move //~crazy association??&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal - create/find crazy/new&lt;br /&gt;
connection/association/reinterpretation/alternative&lt;br /&gt;
by seriously thinking on crazy stuff.&lt;br /&gt;
(Rationally explain the insane thing, and this is how you find a conector??)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive aspect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situation in which it could be useful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// why? how? explain? imagine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//thoughts sparkling through gaps between default and crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is where you find a the &lt;em&gt;crazy association&lt;/em&gt;, try find a connection between the "crazy idea" and reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important thing: the 2nd lane is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the same as the "crazy idea". You find the second lane in the process of trying to connect the "crazy idea" with the reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just trying to make crazy idea make sense will not work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2nd lane lies inbetween the "crazy" lane idea and the "default" lane?? &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This steps connects the 2 lanes, make the "crazy idea" sensible in the hindsight, and that makes a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shirley/annie - buddy/detectives.
You don't have to find the association, you can make one.

&lt;!-- #### 3 Jump&gt;Move

This method is more complex, and requires understanding of some new concepts, but I also think that it is the most interesting and the most universal one.

It is the main reason I am writing this article, I am hoping that it will be possible to create more complex and high-level types of comedy with this method.

Creation of a lot of the most hilarious comedy(xkcd, community) is unlikely to be explained by the first 2 methods, but I think that this one *may* be formalizing the thinking process really cool comedians are going through, but are struggling to explain.

Rest of the article explains the concepts you need to understand to use it and the steps for doing that.
 --&gt;

&lt;!-- Tricks, cheatcodes, comedy patterns --&gt;

&lt;!-- Misdirection is more like a trick than a core method --&gt;

&lt;!-- #### 2 Misdirection. --&gt;

&lt;!-- You can phrase a setup in a way that misleads a person into wrong lanes, creates wrong assumptions. --&gt;

&lt;!-- In this method you basically start with a 2nd lane(the one that the punch line) is based on, and then you come up with a setup that is compatible with it, but strongly suggest a different meaning. --&gt;

&lt;!-- &gt; example  --&gt;

&lt;!-- this method is weird and I'm mentioning it just because I think comedians are often using it. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Example of writing a joke --&gt;

&lt;!-- 5 Setups, take a person through steps of writing a joke --&gt;

&lt;!-- Link to a post about writing setups. Comedy is a quality, 2 characters in a situation, fiction is a source, etc. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Theory of comedy. Prediction: J should be able to write a joke based on these setups. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 characters in a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in stories/dialogue assumptions = expectations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HEY!! I do not need plot there!!
I can just throw 2 characters into a situation and see what happens!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect format:
Short, 5-minute , visual, present tense,  fiction stories.
Screenplay-way
No standup/videos/comics/essays/opinions. No fluff.
2 characters in a situation.
(Do NOT need a plot here!! Chars+situations are not a problem, and then just see what happens and make it ridiculous)
- Dialogue comedy - main one.
- Situation comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- De-bono ideas focus challenge --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topic/area/niche &amp;gt; breakdown, concrete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Focus/Creative pause:
- pick a random thing and decide to challenge/improve it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boring mediocre cliches/default assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things to improve, problems to solve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;challenge everything and ask why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Challenge:
- General "new ideas in the area x"
- Improve "How to improve x?"
- Solve. What's wrong with it?
  Solve problem "Is there a problem? How can I solve it?"
- DBC - Why are we doing it this way? Better way?
- Drop/escape it - what would we do without it?
  Alternatives?
– Achieve&lt;br /&gt;
write jokes about x.
- ask a question nobody has asked before&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="creativity"></category><category term="comedy"></category></entry><entry><title>Story structure</title><link href="/post/story-structure" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-01T12:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-02-01:post/story-structure</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What is a story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story = Setting + Character + Plot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premise&lt;/strong&gt; can be a gap in one or all or between any of thouse things.&lt;br /&gt;
That sparks curiosity - question that you want to know but can't predict the answer to.&lt;br /&gt;
You don't have to know all of them from the beginning, you discover them as you go.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plot(IInc/Goal)
Character
Setting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal/IInc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story consists of events, the sequence of all events put together is a plot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plot&lt;/strong&gt; is a sequence of events in a story, leading to achieving/failing a valuable goal.
&lt;strong&gt;Climax&lt;/strong&gt; - achieving/failing the goal
&lt;strong&gt;IInc&lt;/strong&gt; - creation of a valuable goal
&lt;strong&gt;Event&lt;/strong&gt; - step closer/farther from a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything inbetween - struggling to get it(conflict)
Character - your avatar
Empathy, every step closer/farther to value - emotion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;event&lt;br /&gt;
Meaningful change in character's life.&lt;br /&gt;
Change of value.&lt;br /&gt;
Step towards/away from the goal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;defeating villains is a default&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom-up writing(writing process)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;start with one part, ask questions, explore
coding-style&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do NOT solve the story beforehand by understanding all the theory!!
You WRITE the story, and this is the source, and you have all the ideas inside, as you go, and THEN you use theory to improve it!!
THIS IS IT. THIS IS WHAT I NEED.
Can you plan django code beforehand? NO. And if you try - it will become way overwhelming before you start!! NO. Start writing it!! Use the theory in the process, to shape it and make it better!!
You do NOT use the theory solve it beforehand!! 
You write bottom-up, and then use theory LATER to improve/fill the gaps
//&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PRACTICE SHOULD LEAD. You should pick up everythibg else as a side effect!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;get answers by asking questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You set up an interesting IInc/challenge that creates a cool goal, and then you solve it!!???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;open curiosity gaps and break patterns by making outcomes unexpected(??)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you write you setup a situation and predict what happens next
When you write an essay you ask a question and type down your thought process
- So what, you just take a situation and simulate what happens next? And that is the source?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do NOT think&amp;gt;code, you code&amp;gt;think!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theory is to improve the writing you already have, not to generate new writing!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do NOT use the theory solve it beforehand!! 
You write bottom-up, and then use theory LATER to improve/fill the gaps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRACTICE SHOULD LEAD.
Code-style simulation procedural writing, looking for a goal(beacon).
Plots are NOT the source. Code-style Writing is the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing like coding works!!
Opens the right specific questions, answers are challenging but doable.
Source of the story is simulation. Take a situation, predict outcomes. Open gaps to want to continus to read, subvert expectations for it to be interesting.(/valuable, sense of learning new things)
If McKee plot is not useful as a source for creating a story, maybe joke structure is not useful for creating a joke. What can be a process?
- Essays: Ask a question, type down your thinking process.
- Fiction: Create a situation, simulate the outcomr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovery writibg + de-bono list all the questions that arise!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can make new stories and workbooks are filled with questions on improving the existing ones!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story = setting + character + plot
simple bottom up character in a situation = setting + characacter + problem??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;^^^^!!!!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plot = goal//IInc.
what you essentially need is IInc, this is what creates a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for now, for practical intencs/purposes,
I might as well say
that to write a story I need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;setting + character + IInc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Textbook questions to improve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing value Writing path&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value:
Plot is NOT the only value.
New patterns are value.
- Comedy
- Creative ideas(settings/plots/etc)
- Essays
- Vfx, Sexy ladies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--  drama-plots - basic story. //Cleverness - as in BB. --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Simulation/Prediction. Situation &gt; what happens next? --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Simplest story. IInc-goal(climax)-events --&gt;

&lt;!-- - Boring&gt;interesting.Jump to defeat expectations, curiosity gaps. --&gt;

&lt;!--  scifi - ideas, inventions, world building, munchkinism --&gt;

&lt;!--  underwood-plots --&gt;

&lt;!--  comedy --&gt;

&lt;!-- //essay ph/pd --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Pipeline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedy:
- Character(s)/Setting/IInc
- Bottom-up explore. Have a draft of something. Scene, chars in a situation doing stuff.
- Use it as a setup for comedy.
That's it!!
NO worries about complex plot/etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiction:
- Character(s)/Setting/IInc
- Bottom-up explore. Have a draft of something. Scene, chars in a situation doing stuff.
- Search for:
    - Goal/Climax
    - Plot, sequence of most events
- Add textbook story questions
- //style, improvement, blah blah blah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Process:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Character(s)/Setting/IInc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottom-up explore. Have a draft of something. Chars in a situation doing stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use it as a setup for comedy.
//  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goal/Climax &amp;gt; Draft with climax = Story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textbook story questions to improve story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textbook style/grammar/dialogue/etc questions to polish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;New OM path:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comedy&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds of several gunshots echoed in the abandoned metro station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few bullets blasted the column right above the Max's shoulder as he dived into the space between trash containers to get away from the line of fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He estimated that they had about half a minute, so he got back to vigorously typing in his laptop. "Hey, that's what I call 'agile programming'!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle didn't appreciate the joke. He was hiding behind another column, watching 4 people in expensive suits and with guns in their hands running in their direction. "You've said it will be safe! You've sayed it will be just a simple job!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, the next time we will be more careful"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; time?! You gotta be high to think that I will agree to something like that again!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max just smiled. Typing has slowed down and then stopped with the victorious hit on enter key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now we just give it a minute for it to work. Do you have any idea how do we last a minute without getting shot?"&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[2031-03-11 12:36]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny old house, one of the very few that still left in the center of a big city.
Group of 6 people gathered in the biggest room on the first floor.
All of them looked thoughtful and grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So I take it we're completely screwed, huh?" abscentmindedly mumbled Alice(16 years old, long black hair, very lean) from the couch, without taking eyes off her tablet that was propped against her legs, where she was carefully drawing something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Uh-huh" responded Mike(21 years old, buttoned-up t-shirt with a pocket protector. Seriously.) . He was sitting on the opposite end of the couch, and reading Feynman's lectures on physics(Volume 1) for a 4th time. He was always reading when he was fighting stress. Or not. He was always reading, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How did we manage not to get this one? It was a website for a baking company for ktulhu's-sake!!" asked Amber(22 years old, bulky but comfortable cloth, shuffled red hair), although they all knew perfectly well how "I do not blame Kyle for not pushing on that one, of course" she was sitting on the floor tinkering with wires on the raspberry pi project that she was making. Very, very rarely there was a moment where you could see Amber without a cheerful simle on her face. That was one of thouse moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm telling you, guys, I should've negotiated this project. You all are bored to death with this kind of work, and it shows, I don't really care, so I could've talked them into letting you do the job" Usually relaxed and careless Seth(28 years old, slightly overweight, very hairy and beardy) was playing xbox, but he kept losing the same simple level, his heart wasn't in it. The last part of the sentence rose to the intense scream, as a figure on the screen was firing hell on crowds of aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yiii-ha!!" Max(22, black shuffled hair and short beard, black jeans and shirt with an orange tie, also in glasses - but regular ones, simple black narrow rectangles. Bright and intent brown eyes, with strikingly sharp and saturated, almost orange retinas) looked up from behind his thinkpad x4, happy smile dawning on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What?" Kyle(24, shaved head, goatee, long coat, piercing, intent, intelligent sight from behind his augmented reality glases) was standing in the center of the room, staring intently at Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've got an idea! I've got this friend who..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Uu-ugh..." - from every person in the room. Not again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, hear me out!! This time it's legit... Almost. Well, at least less illegal. And &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; much less dangerous!" they've had this conversation before, but Max was certain that this time he will convince them. They didn't have much of a choice really. He was the only one really excited about a prospect of doing some hacking - he always found it invigorating - but he was pretty sure that all of them will really enjoy that too, eventually. Even though it really didn't seem possible right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Alright, what do you have?" said Kyle, as everybody were staring at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max's simle grew even wider. I knew this time it will work!! As cautious Kyle was, he was clealry more sick of the boring projects than any of them, and he may not like admitting it, but Max remembered very clearly how excited Kyle was on their last and only hack. Despite how that all turned out... Kyle may not think that hacking is very prudent, but this time he will take the interesting and challenging project he was craving for for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have this... acquitance... who says he has a job for us. It won't be like the last time, I promise. It is a small company that doesn't take their security very seriously, and he says that all we need to do is steal some data from them for their competitors. Cmon, let's at least hear what do they have to offer!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fine. Setup a meeting." Kyle's voice was still stern, but his face got noticeably less grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[2031-03-14. 02:36AM]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man in the expensive black suit was standing in the middle of the old metro station, looking bemused. Two serious-looking guys in sunglasses(In the metro. At night.) were standing by his sides. "What did you choose this place for?" said the man, a little concerned. "Couldn't we met in starbucks or something?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle and Max looked at each other. From what Max knew about that kind of meetings from movies, he assumed that the old abandoned metro station was the way to go, besides he thought that this could impress 'an owner of a small company, a regular guy' his acquitance said they were supposed to meet. Now he himself was a little nervous, the guys that were standing in front of them were looking more like some low-level thugs. Thakfully, they were looking confused and unthreatening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is more private" said Kyle, assuming the authoritative tone, Max firmly nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So" said Max, "what job do you have for us?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Recently we learned that our, uhm, competitors, got some data about out company. Private data abot our employees mostly, and also some financial and buisiness information that we would like to keep secret. What you will need to do is to find and destroy all the information they have on their servers about our company"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[to be continued....]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The battle was at it's hardest, and they were losing.
Vi was protecting him and Kyle with her force field while Kyle was struggling to keep his portal open while Dash was attempting to throw sleeping bombs at their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team they were fighting against included very powerful supers. One could control the metal, another, Pyro, could manipulate the fire, and finally, they had a telepath and seer. A seer!! How are you supposed to fight against someone who can literally see the future, even if for 8.5 seconds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant that whenever Dash was going to attack - seer would simply send a telepathic command to magnetto, and Dash would face a metal wall on his way, while having to dodge the streams of fire from Pyro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their only hope was to disable or confuse the seer.
And their only advantage was that dash was faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is not to choose a path that leads to victory, but to make sure that all the paths lead to victory - he remembered someone's quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vi!" said Dash, "Create the force field around the seer!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle's portals could not penetrate Vi's shield, there was a chance that seer's powers will not be able to do that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field around them disappeared, immediately reappearing around the seer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes!!" Apparently that was an attack that seer had no way of avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it was up to Dash and Kyle to disable the last 2 opponents, which suddenly became a lot more doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next second, right before the huge stream of fire was about to hit them, Kyle opened a portal, which consumed the fire and spat it out in the direction of magneto, who this time was unable to dodge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the time slowed down and things seemed to become share but more colorless, as Dash used the last burst of his power to run towards Pyro and shoot a stream of stunning rays at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then everything got quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyro was peacefully sleeping in the middle of the battlefield, seer was trapped in the force field, and magnet to was probably teleported into informatory by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We won!!" yelled Dash, as the simulated environment around them faded, slowly turning into the inwards of a sleeping capsule they used to simulate their training battles.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="short-stories"></category><category term="commuity"></category></entry><entry><title>On the ship</title><link href="/post/on-the-ship" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-31T13:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ray Alez</name></author><id>tag:,2015-01-31:post/on-the-ship</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ship was kneeling left and right as the giant waves were hitting it's sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirate Cornelius was in a bad mood, and that had nothing to do with the storm. He was used to dealing with storms. What he was not used to dealing with was….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But according to even the briefest calculations using Bayesian probability, considering the priors available to me, the chances of that happening are infitesimally small!!” said the thin figure in the black pants and t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornelius looked at his crew. "Alright, which one of you idiots is responsible for taking &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;" the gesture to the figure “on our ship!? And why is he not feeding the sharks since 3 hours ago?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, boss, I'm sorry boss, but you've told us to bring a hostage! You've said that it should be someone from the rich family, but this one even better!! This is a magician!!” said Boram-the-giant, a huge muscular man, a great warrior but not a very sharp guy. He was bigger and stronger than Cornelius, but still very afraid of him - he saw what Cornelius did with many others who were bigger and stronger, yet not careful enough around him. Boram had every intention of staying on the captain's advisor good side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MAGICIAN?? What have you done you fools!! What will we do with the magician?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I've heard they are rich, and have all kinds of artifacts…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The point of taking a hostage was to trade him for money or immunity from federation's ships!! What do you think magicians will do when they find out we have one of their own? Give us money? Ha!! They can teleport into this ship or fly here on dragons or send ghosts on our heads!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look of shock and horror was dawning on the faces of everyone who heard that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh no.... But… but.. But what if we throw him overboard now, and nobody will have to know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah? Have you thought about what this one mage can do to us? I saw spells that burned and sank the whole fleets! And what makes you think that magicians don't know that we took him already? They have ways of knowing about each other." said the old one-legged pirate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, for all we know he is just toying with us, waiting for a pleasant moment to burn this ship or turn us into his fateful zombies or worse….” said skinny-Rick. He was not normally a fearful guy, but right now he wished he was very very far away from this ship, he also heard the tales of what magicians could do when they're angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But this is just a kid.” protested Boram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He. Is. A. MAGICIAN!!” yelled Cornelius. “What part of the word ‘magician’ don't you understand? They can cause tornadoes infested by flaming sharks &lt;em&gt;by accident&lt;/em&gt;!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric's head was spinning. Part of him was still hoping that this was an acid flashback, but the rest of him knew that it wasn't.
Just yesterday he was at his university, attending lectures, hanging with friends, working as a junior software developer in a cool startup, and today….. today was this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last normal thing he remembered was waiting for a cab in Palo Alto to take him to Stanford, when he thought that he saw a glimpse of a weird hooded figure(?). And the next moment, in a brief purple flash, he was standing under the rain, in the middle what seemed like an old town, illuminated only by a full bright moon peering from behind the clouds, and by fire, that was coming from a few burning buildings around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He remembered seeing 3 men with knives and old(?) guns running towards him. And after what seemed like a few minutes of chaos and running and chaos, he regained his consciousness on a wet wooden floor of a cabin. It was immediately obvious that he was on a ship, with all the /?ship equipment? laying around him and hanging off the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he was peeking through the door(which was unlocked), it suddenly jerked open, and the next moment he was dragged outside, and surrounded by a group of terrifyingly looking men, several of them holding their torches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them yelled something, and the group of men took a step back, suddenly looking scared and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, what's going on here?” Eric demanded an explanation. He wasn't usually careless or acting cocky in the uncertain and clearly dangerous situation, but the mixture of confusion and the seeming unreality of what was going on made him determined to find out what the hell any of that meant, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the pirates - of course, these were pirates, stereotypical pirates that could as well have came out of a cartoon - seemed eager to answer his question.
“Where am I?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ehm…. You're on a ship...” said one of the men uncertainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”But according to even the briefest calculations using Bayesian probability, considering the priors available to me, the chances of that happening are infitesimally small!!” Eric felt that he was starting to panic, his attempts to explain how he could get out of the sunny California into the pirate ship in the middle of the night were crashing against the utter impossibility of that happening. Seeing that he was surrounded by a sea in every direction he could look wasn't helping.&lt;/p&gt;

Before anybody had time to say anything, the Dean suddenly appeared in the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, crap, I have just started hoping for a nice, normal day. I guess that doesn't happen in the Greendale, does it?" thought Jeff out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dean was wearing a fabulous light-blue dress, a wig of long light hair, and carrying 3 small stuffed dragons on his shoulders. "Hello everyone!! I am Deanarys Targaryen, the mother of dragons, and I am here to tell you that our school needs your help. Greendale is not the best school, but for generations we have been proud to hold the award for the best pacman score in the area, until City College took it from us 5 years ago. And now I am proud to say that we have an opportunity to get this honor back, return Greendale it's throne, so to speak." said he in a loud and cheerful voice while pointing at his dress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Oh, cmon, guys, please! You are our only chance! Greendale never had a team of heroes to be able to defeat the City College Dynasty of pacman players!! We are hosting the tournament this year, it will be too embarrassing to lose again!” said Dean in response to the disbelieving  stares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, I will kick their butts if it's so important to you. You may not know that, but in school I've always been something of a pacman prodigy.” said Troy with a cocky smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone stared at him in the stunned silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First day of the tournament started the next week, and it was not looking well for Greendale.
It all started when the City College team entered the campus.
Like superheroes ninja assassins their players envaded.
Walking in a weirdly discreet way, turning only in the right angles, never crossing anything diagonally, City College Dynasty of pacman players strode through the Greendale grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were legends that since their first steps these people were learning to walk only in straight lines, along the threads that were suspending small M&amp;amp;M's up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them carrying a flag with a sigyl each of the team members had on their cloth - pacman chasing the ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them were singing something that seemed like a gymn, played with an 8-bit melody, it's words were hard to distinguish, except for the /?repeated lines? that went “waka-waka”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy, looking shocked, turned around and stumbled away, mumbling something about “needing to practice more”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy was practicing energetically the whole time since he saw what he was up against.
He wasn't sure why he was so invested in the game(#q), but he knew that he had to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powerbars and soda cans were lying all around him in the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abed was glancing at him with a slightly worried looks from time to time. Troy should've taken it as a danger sign that this time it was &lt;em&gt;Abed&lt;/em&gt; who was worried about &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt;  behavior, but Troy didn't notice. He had pellets to collect and ghosts to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few minutes of intense gaming the controller fell to the floor as Troy's /?sat back? on the couch, his fierce glare turning into a grimmace of exasperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don't look upset. What's going on?” asked Abed with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last year's record was 827!! 827, Abed!! My best score is 563!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abed smiled slyly “I know what you need. You need a pac-sei.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A pac-what?…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Troy was spending all his time on practice, everyone else were getting busy meeting the City College team - to look for their weaknesses, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, everyone except for Jeff.
“Oh, cmon Jeff!! You have to help us to help Troy!! We have no chance without your help! It is important!” said Pierce persuasively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No I don't, yes you do, and no it's not. And why do you care?” replied Jeff without looking up from his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(#q)“Well, I may or may not have bet a /?considerable amount of money? on Troy winning this game”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why would you do that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, that happened before I saw the city college team, and I wanted to support Troy in his endeavor, because we are bros and that's what bros do ” //Pierce is overly enthusiastic about being bros with Troy in this episode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavy smoke rushed away from the door as the two figures, visible only as dark silhouettes in the bright light of a doorway, entered the small and dimly lit room. Quiet sound of gong signified the presence of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From behind the black-blue-yellow curtains, decorated with labyrinths and pellets and ghosts, came out the pac-master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he looked at the guests, his sight stopped on Troy.
“Hel-” began Troy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I knew this day day would come!” said the Master, with excitement in his voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wha…"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are the one! The chosen one, the only one capanle to defeat the dark warriors of the pac-Dynasty!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy suspected that there was something more than tobacco in the pac-master's pipe, but said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hello, ehm, pac-master. I am here to learn from you the ancient art of…. beating the pacman game with the highest score or something… ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know” said the Master, looking all incredibly wise and experienced. “Come with me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient computer stood in the clouded room.
Figures off ghosts and pellets were spread across the small space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy was dodging the stick with the ghosts at the end of it, pac-master was trying to reach him with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is this really necessary? I thought I was going to learn tp play the game!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To play pacman” (in a heavy accent) “you must learn to think like pacman, you must BE pacman!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Greendale Ben Chang was unrolling the red tape. The whole campus was /?inwebd? by it, as no straight 90 degree angle left in the entire college grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students were navigated the labyrinth of the tapes looking annoyed and confused, but not anywhere near as much as the /?opponents? have been. This was war, and Chang had only one weapon - of a psychological kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time you could see ghosts images and people in ghost costumes jumping from behind the corners inside buildings, /?breeding? panic among the City College students. 
Their team was looking distressed but determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the last battle everything was quiet in the Greendale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of the computer class there was a brightly lit /?boxing podium? with 2 computers old standing in the center of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited crowd gathered around the scene, and at the sound of gong, 2 players entered the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure in the black /?battle dress? with a yellow belt was the /?Chinese? player, the last survivor of the ruthless tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure in the black robes threw back it's /?head thingy? revealing the determined face of Troy barns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And so we met again" said he ominously.
The opponent replied with a sharp nod.
Well, let's get to it then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the battle has began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboard keys were pressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pellets were eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghosts were destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last seconds of the battle, Troy remembered in a flashback and applied the secret trick his teacher has taught him, thus defeating his opponent, and getting the glorious prize of a pacman-cup back to the Greendale.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="short-stories"></category><category term="commuity"></category></entry></feed>
