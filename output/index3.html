	    <p><strong>[WP] a zombie apocalypse occurs, the weak and inadequate are killed, but 500 years later the natural selection of the apocalypse leaves only the strongest and brightest to breed and rebuild. Everyone is the best of the best.</strong></p>
<p>"Welcome everyone to the 500 anniversary of a zombie apocalypse celebration party! Today we celebrate the biggest tragedy in the history of humanity, that has also turned out to be our greatest fortune. Just in 28 days all of the humanity's problems were solved. Global warming, starvation, lack of energy and resources, all wars and conflicts. All thanks to the unnamed hero, the mad biohacker, who, using his home-grown, genetically modified virus, did what the rest of our ancestors never had the balls to do - wipe out 98% of ...</p>

<p>It has been 1232 since the shipwreck. I did my best to preserve the food that was left, I have learned to hunt, and stretched the last container of sweets for a year, so that I could eat something tasty whenever I miss home the most. But all good things end. I'm down to my last Oreo.</p>
<p>I've looked at her for months, never daring to touch. I talk to her sometimes. I call her Vera.
A week ago somethhing troubling has happened. She started responding. That means that this should end, I should eat her to not descend further into insanity. But I can't, I love her! She is ...</p>

<p>This list is compiled mostly from recommendations on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/">/r/rational</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/">/r/HPMOR</a>, and my personal must-read list. Items in each category are arranged starting from the best and most awesome, so you can just begin <!-- start --> reading them <!-- starting --> from the top.</p>

	  <p>
	    <p>This article is about the 2nd biggest challenge in writing fiction, besides generating creaitve ideas - putting these ideas togethre into an engaging, meaningful, and educational experience. </p>
<p>That is - creating stories.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the process of creating a story is itself a great source of new ideas.</p>
<!-- Writing fiction is the best way to get great at generating creative ideas. -->

<h2>Writing fiction to generate ideas</h2>
<p>My goal is to get better at creative thinking, at generating new, unexpected, interesting clever and valuable ideas, and disrupting the default thinking patterns.</p>
<p>As the best tool for that I choose writing fiction.</p>
<p>There are other "creative" fields that require generation of new ideas(writing essays, creating inventions, etc), I chose fiction over them for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike other fields, fiction's primary focus creating new ideas, not as means to attain something, or as a ...</li></ul></!-->

	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the <a href="/post/creativity">previous post</a> I've explained techniques for coming up with creative ideas.</p>
<p>Here my goal is to explain how comedy works, and to understand the process of writing jokes.
If I am successful, I will be able to teach a person who has no experience of writing comedy to write jokes at will, whenever he wants.</p>
<p>Below are my ideas and hypothesis about how comedy works, if they are correct, after reading and understanding this post, you should be able to take a setup, go through a series of steps, and end up writing a joke(s).
<!-- regardless of how good they are, just has to be recognizable as a joke --></p>
<h1>What is comedy?</h1>
<p>Remember, from the <a href="/post/creativity">previous post on creativity</a>, that we think in thinking patterns(lanes) that are the "trails of thought", everything that you consciously recognie ...</p>

	    <p>In the <a href="/post/essay">previous post</a> I've described how to find challenges to exercise your creativity.</p>
<p>This post is about generating new and creative ideas.</p>
<h2>Background (how mind works)</h2>
<p>The main function of a brain is to make predictions about the world.
(when you can predict what happens next you are better at survival and reproduction).</p>
<p>Brain makes predictions by learning(memorizing) and then recognizing patterns.</p>
<h3>Default thinking patterns</h3>
<p>When you think you follow a sequence of familiar, memorized steps, to go from one thought to another.
These are "thinking patterns", I will call them "<strong>lanes</strong>"</p>
<p>Example:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>What is the last worrd at the end of this _______?
</pre></div>


<p>You can naturally fill the last word(sentence) because you have recognized the beginning of a familiar pattern, and can predict ...</p>
