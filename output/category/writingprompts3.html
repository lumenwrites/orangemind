<p>"Sudo, make me sandwich."</p>
<p>"Yes, master." <em>oh, crap, what is going on with me?</em> John went to the kitchen and started slicing bread. Emily looked at him with a smug smile.</p>
<p>John passed her a sandwich "How the hell are you doing this?"</p>
<p>Emily's smile grew wider "Maybe you shouldn't use such an obvious root password."</p>
<p>"What? It still doesn't  make any sense!"</p>
<p>"Oh, and one more thing I forgot to mention. You probably don't remember, but we were in a car crash, and didn't survive. So we had to use the services of Resurrection Inc, and now our consciousness' were ...</p>

<p>It has been 1232 since the shipwreck. I did my best to preserve the food that was left, I have learned to hunt, and stretched the last container of sweets for a year, so that I could eat something tasty whenever I miss home the most. But all good things end. I'm down to my last Oreo.</p>

<p>Now it felt like walls were constantly appearing in the way of my mind. I was used to think about anything I want, and whatever I imagined was real. I was the god in my universe and now it felt like my powers were taken away from me, every day I could do less and less.</p>
<p>Only a week ago I was living in a space station, I was able to fly and to cast magic. But since then every day, every hour, a piece of a beautiful world I was living ...</p>
