	    <p><strong>[WP] When you were younger you murdered 4 people in cold blood. 30 years later you meet the man who confessed and went to prison for your murders.</strong></p>
<p>"Hello, Vincent."</p>
<p>Vince froze in place, staring in shock at a man who stood in front of his door.</p>
<p>"Hello, father." he looked in the cold blue eyes of a man he hasn't seen for 30 years. "Come in."</p>
<p>"Doctors say I do not have much longer. I've come to say goodby." another shock. Father was always terse and got straight to the point.</p>
<p>"I'm...." <em>sorry?</em> Didn't seem like a proportional thing to say.... </p>
<p>"You did what you thought was right, I did what I thought was right. I don't regret anything. I wish you ...</p>

	    <p><strong>[WP] You write a cookbook that brings world peace. What is the third recipe?</strong></p>
<p>Recepie 3:</p>
<p>To create a super mutated chickenpox potion of doom and power, take a chicken, a brontosaurus' egg, and a turtle. Wait until the sunset on a darkest day of a 3rd moon. Go to the clearing in a deep forest(don't forget your nuclear physics book, wild boar's eyes, photonic crystal semiconductor laser, and, of course, a bald toad). Then, follow the Standard Mad Scientist's Potion Making Instructions from chapter 4.</p>
<p>Caution: Be warned, the side effects may include vomiting, diarrhea,  uncontrollable giggling, jumping on one's leg until collapse of exhaustion, and, in rare cases, love for one's neighbor and peaceful acceptance of life during the last ...</p>

	  <p>
	    <p>The only thing that I have ever knew was void. You could say that it surrounded me forever since there was no time before I created it. At first all I was was awareness, just the sense of conciousness with nothing else. Gradually, I started to think thoughts in the midst of this void. I've made up time and space. And once I was thinking in this emptiness I got horribly bored. So I've turned my thoughts into figures and images. I've imagined light, which turned into stars and galaxies and later - planets. And thus Maya was born.</p>
<p>On one of the planets I have created animals and humans, just in one whim of my desire. I could simulate the whole history of this universe ...</p>

<p>"Oh, man, aren't they supposed to be like big and green?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what I have expected. Why is it filled with pink monkeys instead?"</p>
<p>"Ehm.. Maybe that asteroid had something to do with that?"</p>
<p>"I told you dammit, no asteroids! This was supposed to be my science project for school, why did you have to screw it up?"</p>
<p>"Science project? Oh, cmon, big lizards? It's stupid. When I was your age, my science project was a planet with giant robots, fighting against each other across multiple dimensions."</p>
<p>"Maybe, but now I don't even have lizards! What am I supposed to do with these tiny things? Look at them, they aren't ...</p>

	    <p><strong>[WP] Your friend tells you "pinch me I'm dreaming". As a joke you do as he asks. He then vanishes afterwards.</strong></p>
<p>Lucas disappeared, popped out of existence like a soap bubble. Michael panicked.
Does that mean I'm in his dream? <em>No!</em> The world around him blurred and twisted for a moment. He saw a tall building crushing down in the distance. Colors grew pale.
<em>No-no-no-no-no!! I can't let him wake up, everything will disappear!</em> he thought, but then realized that it is too late. All dreams end, and in a few minutes, by the time Lucas walks to his kitchen to grab a cup of coffee, the remaining memories of this world will be wiped away from his mind.
Michael felt his body losing sharpness ...</p>
