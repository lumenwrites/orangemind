	  <p>
	    <p>I've read the news about you guys shutting down the development of bitvid, and it saddens me. It was obviously a brilliant idea that got a lot of people very excited, I can't imagine why you would give up on that. I have very little information about the internal state of the project, but I can't stop thinking that maybe it doesn't have to die.</p>
<p>I've came up with several ideas about what could be done to keep it alive, so I would like you to read them, and possibly allow me to implement them.</p>

<h3>Pivot - focus on creators</h3>

<p>So you've read <a href="http://hpmor.com/">HPMOR</a>, it blew your mind, and you're looking for more things like that to read. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find something that would equal it in awesomeness, but I did my best to compile a list of readings that the kind of person who loved HPMOR would enjoy.</p>
<p>This list is compiled mostly from recommendations on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/">/r/rational</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/">/r/HPMOR</a>, and my personal must-read list. Items in each category are arranged starting from the best and most awesome, so you can just begin <!-- start --> reading them <!-- starting --> from the top.</p>
<!-- If you have suggestions about this list - you can help me to improve it by leaving your ideas in the comments, or editing this article directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/raymestalez/orangemind/blob/master/content/rational-reading-list.md). -->

	    <p>This article is about the 2nd biggest challenge in writing fiction, besides generating creaitve ideas - putting these ideas togethre into an engaging, meaningful, and educational experience. </p>
<p>That is - creating stories.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the process of creating a story is itself a great source of new ideas.</p>
<!-- Writing fiction is the best way to get great at generating creative ideas. -->

<h2>Writing fiction to generate ideas</h2>
<p>My goal is to get better at creative thinking, at generating new, unexpected, interesting clever and valuable ideas, and disrupting the default thinking patterns.</p>
<p>As the best tool for that I choose writing fiction.</p>
<p>There are other "creative" fields that require generation of new ideas(writing essays, creating inventions, etc), I chose fiction over them for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike other fields, fiction's primary focus creating new ideas, not as means to attain something, or as a ...</li></ul></!-->

	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the <a href="/post/creativity">previous post</a> I've explained techniques for coming up with creative ideas.</p>
<p>Here my goal is to explain how comedy works, and to understand the process of writing jokes.
If I am successful, I will be able to teach a person who has no experience of writing comedy to write jokes at will, whenever he wants.</p>
<p>Below are my ideas and hypothesis about how comedy works, if they are correct, after reading and understanding this post, you should be able to take a setup, go through a series of steps, and end up writing a joke(s).
<!-- regardless of how good they are, just has to be recognizable as a joke --></p>
<h1>What is comedy?</h1>
<p>Remember, from the <a href="/post/creativity">previous post on creativity</a>, that we think in thinking patterns(lanes) that are the "trails of thought", everything that you consciously recognie ...</p>

	    <p>In the <a href="/post/essay">previous post</a> I've described how to find challenges to exercise your creativity.</p>
<p>This post is about generating new and creative ideas.</p>
<h2>Background (how mind works)</h2>
<p>The main function of a brain is to make predictions about the world.
(when you can predict what happens next you are better at survival and reproduction).</p>
<p>Brain makes predictions by learning(memorizing) and then recognizing patterns.</p>
<h3>Default thinking patterns</h3>
<p>When you think you follow a sequence of familiar, memorized steps, to go from one thought to another.
These are "thinking patterns", I will call them "<strong>lanes</strong>"</p>
<p>Example:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>What is the last worrd at the end of this _______?
</pre></div>


<p>You can naturally fill the last word(sentence) because you have recognized the beginning of a familiar pattern, and can predict ...</p>
