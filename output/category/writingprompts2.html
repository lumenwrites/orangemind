	    <p>Windows shattered and in the next moment the roof was ripped away from the car. The speeding ferrari was lifted 2 meters up into the air, then dropped back to the road, Jack was barely able to handle the steering wheel and to keep moving.</p>
<p>Alice, who was sitting in the passenger seat, dropped now useless guns, and reached under her seat for the bazooka.</p>
<p>4 gigantic pigeons were following the car, weathers burned away from previous explosions, muscles bulging under the bullet-proof skin. They looked like fat and jacked pterodactyls. One of them emitted an angry roar, threw away the roof he was holding in his claws, and dived after the car. At the same time Jack made a sharp turn, so the pigeon missed and smashed ...</p>

	    <p><strong>[WP]: Describe the ugliest person imaginable using only praises and compliments</strong></p>
<p>She was more handsome than a barfing snail. When people looked at her they couldn't look away, and dreamed about her for weeks after, waking up screaming every night. Her hair were like an ocean, a very deep ocean with terrifying creatures underneath. She had beautiful blue eyes, a lot of them, looking kindly at each other.
What can I say, that girl stole my heart. And refused to give it back until I kiss her. That was a wonderful moment I won't be able to forget for the rest of my life, no matter how hard I try.</p>

<p>Cold brilliant light of the stars turned into bright streaks of light. At the center of it there was a glowing, unimaginably distant bright dot. Luckily, ghosts have no mass, so David was able to travel at 99.999% of the speed of light. He knew that Alpha Centauri, the closest star to Earth, is 4.3 light years away. He knew that he could not possibly reach it in 24 hours that he had left. He knew that no matter how fast he could go, it would never become visibly ...</p>

<p>"...and this is the photo of the last remaining specimen of Glip-Glops, the species exterminated in a month after they were discovered. Unfortunately for these cute, intelligent, and peaceful creatures, they turned out to be the most delicious thing in the galaxy. Their meat was so tasty that eating it was described as '100 times more joyful than an orgasm' and '10 times more addictive than heroin'. In effort to preserve them, the last one of them is now hidden in a secret place, guarded by robots preventing hundreds of Glip-Glop-addicts from reaching him, while scientists are trying to clone him ...</p>

<p>He was hungry and lonely. He was dying of thirst, and suffocating because of the amount of waste there was in the cell. It looked like a small cube, with no windows, no doors, and only one camera staring at him from the wall.</p>
<p>He was living here for several weeks,  and it seemed fine at first. Food used to appear out of thin air from time to time, and the poop he left in the corner disappeared after a couple of hours.
Sometimes a ball appeared, which he could play with, bouncing it off the walls and catching, but it has always disappeared after a few ...</p>

Today we celebrate the biggest tragedy in the history of humanity, that has also turned out to be our greatest fortune. Just in 28 days all of the humanity's problems were solved. Global warming, starvation, lack of energy and resources, all wars and conflicts.
