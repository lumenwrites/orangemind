<p>Greetings, faggots:</p>
<p>My name is xXSwaGGy-Quarlax [FaZe], Interplanetary Diplomat for the Andromeda Galaxy. I would like to begin this message by assuring you that I am not a camping faggot, nor will my people attempt to quick scope you. Although we have amassed many 360 no scopes throughout our collective lives, we come with a message of peace. I hope to make clear that this is a knife-only match and we will not be attempting any faggotry, nor will we feed mid. We wish only to share our swag amongst your people, you fucking aim botting hackers. </p>
<p>My clan and I have traveled many millions of light years in search of sentient life, visiting thousands of planets in an attempt to make contact and find the dankest kush. While we have been forced to pwn many noobs and fuck countless mothers on several of those worlds, reking their shit harder than a Haitian Earthquake, we only did so out of self-preservation. None of those planets held any life beyond the hostile and untamable, nor any blunts to blaze upon. It was truly us against them; however, we wish to make it clear that we do have blood on our hands. We, as an intergalactic species, understand that trust is founded upon honesty, and thus tell you retard hackers of our former faggotry. That said, we assure you that your obese, apartment dwelling neckbeards will stand safely beside us and shall never be shrekt.</p>
<p>We first located your planet nearly six Earth years ago and have been monitoring your communication devices, which you call “X-Box,” to learn your jargon and construct our message of peace. We hope that you understand our dialect and not see us as pay 2 win feeders. In order to further express our good faith, we have amassed a large collection of Code Red Mountain Dew and Cool Ranch Doritos, which we would like to share with your MLG pros. We hope you accept our offering in peace, and that you not fuck our mothers. We wish only to become allies with you, the faggot tryhards of Earth. </p>
<p>Please find us waiting for you at your trailer park tomorrow at sunrise. We will be in the large flying aircraft, which should be just a few pounds lighter than that of your mother's left tit.</p>
<p>Ayy lmao,</p>

<h4>[WP] At the age of 18 you are permitted to redistribute your twenty skill points around into whatever skills you want permanently. You decided to put everything into LUCK and leave the rest at 0 points.</h4>
<p>Score: 6117</p>
<p>"That's not a good idea, Ben. For one, we don't have great data on the actual effects of enhanced Luck..."</p>
<p>"Look, can you do it or not? I need this."</p>
<p>The gene tech sighed in the quiet office and swiveled his chair back to the computer. He was looking at a fairly standard representation of a human genome, red highlights in the mass of blue to indicate genes with likely altered function from human baseline and green to indicate potential areas for change.</p>
<p>"Let's see, we have some modifiable options at rs2981205, rs730882133, rs423454-"</p>
<p>"Yeah, man, I get it, lots of fancy words. Bottom line it for me?" Ben shifted impatiently in his chair; flipping his phone from hand to hand.</p>
<p>"Based on population-level studies and retrospective analysis of lottery winners, survivors of freak accidents, etc, there's about 20 genes we could modify in you to try to make you luckier. I'm obligated to point out that we don't know for sure that these genes actually <em>cause</em> better luck, and frankly the latest research is casting some doubts on the validity-"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah, I signed the waiver already, do what you got to do; I have a lot riding on this."</p>
<p>"Um, you already made the bet? And you want to get lucky now?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly, I don't really want to explain."</p>
<p>"Whatever, they're your genes. Sign this form here, some more standard stuff. Given the specific genes we need to modify, you are looking at 85% chance for significant loss in strength, 90% chance for loss in fine and gross motor skills, 100% for loss in intelligence, 60% chance for loss in overall body aesthetic and symmetry, and 50% chance for loss in short and long term memory."</p>
<p>Ben, took the tablet, skimming over most of the form. When he had scrolled to the bottom, he pressed his finger on the fingerprint scanner, acknowledging his agreement. He let his shoulders relax afterwards, like a weight had been lifted off.</p>
<p>"Ok then" he said to himself in a quieter voice; "that's settled."</p>
<p>"Not quite, Ben. Given the severity of potential deficits you are required to provide a sperm sample on the chance that you would prefer to have unaltered children in the future. Furthermore, while we strongly suggest implantable birth control for all men and women that undergo elective alteration, per the 2024 SAFEGene act, prior to sexual intercourse with any potentially fertile partners, you both must be screened for possible gene incompatibility."</p>
<p>"Yeah, everyone knows the rules."</p>
<p>"OK, here's your sample cup; I'll give you some time to provide the sample and I'll get the CRISPR transfer virus ready."</p>
<hr />
<p>Ben rolled up his sleeve, exposing a slightly faded tattoo; a simple heart motif with the name "Jess" on it.</p>
<p>"Just a slight poke, then you'll be all set. This is your last chance to change your mind..."</p>
<p>"Get it over with."</p>
<p>"OK"</p>
<p>The tech injected Ben's left deltoid with the modified viral delivery system. Over the next 48 hours, the virus, a modified version of the flu, would infect the vast majority of his cells and re-write all of his DNA.</p>
<p>"It's done. Now, you'll probably have some soreness, fatigue, and a fever for the next couple days, similar to flu symptoms. This virus isn't contagious, but to be safe, you need to avoid the very young and the elderly. Take tylenol if the fever or pain get bad. If you have difficulty breathing, pass out, or anything like that, get to a hospital immediately."</p>
<p>"Got it. Thanks, doc."</p>
<p>"Good luck."</p>
<hr />
<p>Two months later, Ben's life, as far as any outsider was concerned, was pretty much unchanged. He'd had to quit his job as a barista; it was a bit too fast paced for him with his new weakness and difficultly remembering simple tasks. He'd found a perfect job, working at one of the few private libraries remaining in Baltimore. He'd only get one or two customers a day and they were usually older; if anything, Ben found himself getting along better with them than people his own age; the elderly clients seemed to talk and move at the pace he was accustomed to these days.</p>
<p>He settled in well to his new life; he was more lonely than he had been, but that suited him well. He had a new companion, in the form of a stray he named Tipsy, that had wandered up to his feet when he was getting back to his apartment one night. She only had three paws and occasionally fell over, but they were fast friends.</p>
<p>All in all, his life was stable, boring; an easy sort of anguish. And every day, as he left the library, sometimes with Tipsy peeking out of his backpack along with a few children's books; the short ones with the easier words, he would take the 57 bus and transfer to the 23 to get to the long term care facility. There he would take the elevator to the fourth floor, his legs a bit too weak for the stairs, and sit next to Jess, who was perpetually silent except for the occasional hiss and beep of the ventilator, and read to her. Often, he would fall asleep in the chair next to her, dreaming that perhaps tomorrow would be his lucky day, and he would get to talk to her again.   </p>
<hr />
<p>So all of you are ridiculous, amazing people. Thank you for reading and for sharing your thoughts and feedback about the story! Definitely a deeply motivating experience to write more in the future.</p>

<h4>[WP] A wife kills her husband. Make me sympathize with both characters.</h4>
<p>Score: 6090</p>
<p>He was drunker than usual.  Ordinarily, she would feel relief when he collapsed onto the couch by the TV.  That meant he was too drunk to yell and fight.  Tonight, she felt no relief.  All she could do was watch him from the doorway, hoping he would drink the poisoned whiskey she had just poured him.</p>
<p>A lump sat in her throat as she watched his fat belly rise and fall with his labored breath.  In his hand, he held the last drink she would ever pour for him.  He sat there for a few minutes in silence without even looking at the glass of whiskey he clutched in his fat fingers.  Then, without warning, he downed the entire glass in one movement.</p>
<p>He let the glass hit the ground and sighed.  He would go to sleep soon.  It wouldn’t be painful.  Nowhere near as painful as the last twenty-three years had been for her.  She wanted him to leave the world peacefully.  She still loved him, after all.  Still, she felt he deserved an explanation.  At the very least, he deserved a good-bye.</p>
<p>She walked around to the front of the couch.  He rolled his half-opened eyes in her direction and the two stared at each other in silence.</p>
<p>“There was more than whiskey in your drink,” she said, her voice shaking.  “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Your black eye is healing,” he said quietly.  “You know I’m sorry about hurting you.  Don’t you?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“You were very beautiful once.  I can still see it sometimes.  When you smile.  You don’t smile much these days.  But when you do, your eyes flash like they did when we were teenagers.  It reminds me of how young and beautiful we were.  Young, beautiful, and carefree.”</p>
<p>“Your drink,” she said with tears forming in her eyes.  “You’re dying.  I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>“I know,” he whispered and slowly nodded.  “I saw you pour it.”</p>
<p>She put her hands over her mouth and tried not to cry.</p>
<p>“Do you remember that field trip we took during our second year of high school?” he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“We spent the whole day together,” he said as his voice became fainter.  “It was the first time I really met you.  There were fifty or sixty of us there but I only cared about you.  On the bus ride home, we sat next to each other.  Do you remember now?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“Everybody on the bus slept.  They were so tired.  But not us.  We couldn’t stop talking to each other.  We had so much to say back then.  When you started to drift off to sleep, I was sad.  But then you said something to me.  Do you remember what it was?”</p>
<p>“I-” she paused to steady her voice.  “I’m going to lean on you, ok?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said as a smile slowly spread across his face.  “And you fell asleep on my shoulder.  I couldn’t sleep the whole bus ride because I was so happy that we were having that moment.  And I know you didn’t sleep either.  The bus bounced too much.  And back then my arms were muscular.  You just wanted to be close to me.  I’m sorry I was such a lousy pillow.  And I’m sorry I was an even lousier husband.”</p>
<p>She wanted to say something but could not.</p>
<p>His voice slowed even further.  He spoke as if he was in a dream.  “I still love you as much as I did on that bus ride.  I just got worse at showing it.  I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>She did not reply.  She just stood and tried to compose herself.  After a moment, she walked over and sat next to him on the couch.  </p>
<p>“I’m going to lean on you, ok?” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Ok,” he replied as she rested her head against his arm.</p>
<p>The two sat in silence until his breathing stopped at last.</p>

<p>I was fourteen when it all started. I'd been out one day, waiting for some friends at the park, as you do. I was eating a chocolate bar and apathetically tossed the wrapper aside. An old lady approached me. </p>
<p>"Don't you have any respect? Pick that up."</p>
<p>Naturally I ignored her, being the lovely young man that I was until she screamed.</p>
<p>"Fine! Have it your way! If you shall litter the Earth, then I shall litter your mind."</p>
<p>She promptly left and I was confused, I assumed she was just a bit of an old bat. The wrapper blew away, and my friends turned up. We played some football, I was always fairly horrendous at that. </p>
<p>The next day, I woke up. For some reason the first thing I thought of was the old lady. I realised that it was fairly obnoxious for me to act that way to someone. Ah well, I'll probably never see her again anyway. I went downstairs and greeted my mother who has been a bit of a struggling single for a while now (I guess having an obnoxious teenage brat doesn't help much). There was a two, hovering above her head; cyan in colour. I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time. I knew that, objectively, this was strange. Intuitively, however, it felt oddly natural. So I went about my day.</p>
<p>As I went through school that day, I noticed everybody had the numbers. Notably my friend Tim who was a brown belt in karate had a blue four, our loud ex-military teacher who enjoyed startling sleeping students was a yellow six. The school bully was a turquoise three. Most students were a one or a two; shades of green. I could never see a number above my own head in reflections or anything like that, much to my frustration. </p>
<p>When I watched TV I noticed that powerful people tended to have quite high numbers. The anchor had a five, the prime minister had a nine, some footage of an army doing a parade seemed to show a range from six to eight (a vibrant red).</p>
<p>Eventually, after having thought about this for a few weeks, I concluded that the number corresponded to danger. Being dangerous can mean many things. It can mean you're potent in a fight, or it can mean you have a lot of say socially. </p>
<p>One day, I was sitting in the park with my mother and some of her friends on a day out. She introduced me to someone new. Short, goatee, slicked back hair and an eight. He sat there, casually sipping on a can of lager. My mum introduced him as Sean, "my new boyfriend."</p>
<p>"WHAT?!"</p>
<p>So I couldn't control that little outburst, I must admit I panicked a bit. An eight is a member of the cabinet, a soldier, a serial murderer (What? The numbers come up on Crimewatch as well, you know). </p>
<p>He interjected, "Haha! Relax kid. I'm going to be around for a while" </p>
<p>At which point he leaned in and kissed my mum. This was not affection; this was dominance.</p>
<p>In the following days, I took my mum aside repeatedly to try to convince her to get out of this. She was, how can I put it? Thoroughly unwilling. So now I was anxious, I was frustrated. We were around Sean's house at the time. He came in later that day, bringing home some shopping, he bought me a chocolate bar. Well, that was nice? Thanks.</p>
<p>So it started out nicely enough. He could tell that I was anxious, and so he'd buy me little things to try to win my affections. To be honest, it started to work. My mum was in love with him and despite the red flags, I was honestly settling to the arrangement. What I hadn't noticed were the little things. At first it began as complaints; "the jam isn't in the cupboard I said to put it in", "clean up that fucking cat shit". Benign, but said with a sharp tongue.</p>
<p>Eventually he offered to fully support my mother. I'm not really sure how he was able to do this as he didn't have a job of which to speak, but it seemed to work out. My mum quit her job at the supermarket and now had much more free time to... "do those fucking dishes," to "make a doctor's appointment for me". He spoke repeatedly of their sex life to me. Thanks for telling me. Over time his demands were shouting.</p>
<p>Mum's number dropped from a two to a one. Something was wrong.</p>
<p>This kind of behaviour carried on for a year. I was the frog in the pot.</p>
<p>Eventually he started doing things; hitting her when I wasn't around. I didn't notice of course, although I started to pick up the signs. Then one day I did. They had a huge argument. They were shouting, things were thrown. They wouldn't stop. The walls closed in. I had nowhere to go. In my right conscience, I had nowhere I could go. I was just as frightened as she was until that is I heard a crack; he headbutted her. Blood poured forth. I freaked the fuck out. I started screaming. I started crying. I had no idea what way was up. I briefly ran into the bathroom to try  to collect myself and figure out what the fuck I was supposed to do. I was scared. I was shaking. I was angry. I was livid. I was FURIOUS. And through the tears I saw the stained bathroom mirror. Everything was blurry but I saw it right there. Black as night, floating right above my own head. I could finally see it: Ten.</p>
<p>"Fuck them, fuck him, fuck everyone. Fuck this abusive piece of shit. I am taking control of this situation." </p>
<p>In that very briefly lucid state, I called an ambulance.</p>
<p>I then broke the mirror, threw it at the ground. I picked the the largest shard of glass and looked at myself again. Ten. Definitely ten.</p>
<p>I called down. "Sean! Let's fucking talk!"</p>
<hr />

<p>"I'm sorry to bring you here like this."</p>
<p>"Not at all, my dear boy. Not at all."</p>
<p>"But, you see, I have to know… I have to know, and you're the only one –"</p>
<p>"I get it," the old man interrupted me. He puffed his cheeks weakly, like it took him great effort just to breathe, 
and then he leaned back against the armchair and his eyes turned to the crackling of the fireplace. "Ask away."</p>
<p>"Well… it's pretty simple, actually." I leaned forward. "What's it like?"</p>
<p>His eyes turned to me, and he almost smiled. <em>"What's it like?"</em></p>
<p>"Yeah. Life. Growing up. Being old." I paused. "Well, not that I'm calling you old, I just –"</p>
<p>"It's okay, dear boy," he laughed. "I am old. That's why you brought me here."</p>
<p>I said nothing. He arranged himself on the armchair like he had all the time in the world. Then his eyes went up to 
me again. "It's… hard."</p>
<p>I waited. I knew he wasn't done.</p>
<p>"It's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do, actually" he continued. "Harder than building all this fancy equipment you've built. Harder than studying all you've studied. Harder than winning all these scientific awards you've won so far." He chuckled. "Nothing prepares you for it."</p>
<p>"What makes it hard?" I asked. "Is it the responsibilities? The body decaying? What makes growing up so hard?"</p>
<p>"No. It's not the responsibilities. Growing up is like looking both ways before you cross the street, then getting hit by an airplane." He lowered his head as if to put his thoughts together, then continued. "It's the things you don't expect that catch you by surprise. Sure, it's scary to have a kid, and to get married, and to ask your boss for a promotion, and all these grown-up stuff we have to <em>pretend</em> we know how to do."</p>
<p>"Pretend?"</p>
<p>He seemed surprised. "Yes, pretend. No one really grows up, of course. We put on a face to the world, but at home, three in the morning, all alone watching TV, you're still sixteen. All of us are." He shook his head. "There's nothing more heartbreaking than being a real person and sitting down in front of another real person, and then both of you have to act like fake people. You sit across from someone two years older than you in a job interview and you both say 'Hello, sir' and 'Yes, I also think the Dow Jones has been fluctuating dangerously this last few days' and 'Oh, absolutely, the 405 is a nightmare this time of day'. And all along you <em>know</em> you both laugh at poop jokes and fart sounds and you have all these hobbies and interests and you curse and say fuck and shit and asshole. You're real people. But you act like robots. You have to put on the face, and they have to put on a face, and you have to pretend that nothing in life is ever fun, everything is productivity and seriousness."</p>
<p>"Is that what makes it hard?" I asked. "That everyone's just… faking their way through adulthood?"</p>
<p>"No. No, that's expected. It sucks, but we all know what we're getting into." He sighed. "No, what catches you by 
surprise are the little things about growing up. It's being stuck in traffic and remembering a day. Any day. A locker 
room conversation in high school. A teacher. A friend of a friend. Something that happened long enough ago that 
it could order its own drink. It sneaks up on you, and you look at yourself in the rear view and you think, my 
God… where did it go? When did I become so old?</p>
<p>"I remember college like it was yesterday. I remember my girlfriends and my friends and they used to drink and 
talk about sex and hanging out and now they all eat oatmeal and go to funerals. And I do that to, and I <em>like</em> all of that. Well, not going to funerals, but oatmeal. Soap operas. Going to bed at nine. I like it."</p>
<p>"So what's the problem?"</p>
<p>"The problem is I'm still the sixteen year old. I'm still the college kid. My needs and wants have changed, and my 
body has changed, and my mind has changed, in a way, but <em>I</em> didn't change. I'm still putting on a face. So when 
these thoughts sneak up on me – when a flash of a college party or a roadtrip or the feeling of falling asleep in the 
back of my Dad's car wells up on me… it breaks me. It breaks me because I don't think of it fondly. I don't look at 
that young kid with affection and nostalgia, I look at him with envy. Envy, because he's got all of that ahead of him 
still, and he doesn't even know how lucky he is. He's me, we're the same – but he's got the good looks and the 
health and all the years ahead of him, and I'm wasting away in an old apartment. And I hate that kid so much. Every time he sneaks up on me I hate him more."</p>
<p>I looked down, then up. "What about family? Kids?"</p>
<p>"They are great. They are amazing. But they go away. They're not <em>you</em>. In the end, you raise your sons and 
daughters for the world, not for yourself. They have to fall asleep in the back of <em>my</em> car, and go to <em>their</em> college parties and all that… they don't exist for my benefit. No one exists for my benefit but myself. And I'm much too old to do anything about it."</p>
<p>I swallowed dry and averted my eyes to the fireplace. The old man leaned forward. "We always get the feeling that 
the good old days are either behind us or ahead of us. They're never our own days. We were always born just a 
bit too late to go to Woodstock or to see Nirvana live or to see the Berlin Wall fall or to party Great Gatsby style in the 20's. And then we get old and we realize we were born too soon to see the wonders of technology and the world reshaping and blooming into something new and exciting. But the truth is, our Woodstocks were happening all around us as we grew. Our new and exciting world was some old guy's boring present, and our past will be some spoiled, arrogant kid's 'Good old days'. We were just too stupid to realize it when it mattered. So we let it slide away. And then we ended up like me – sad and resentful of our younger selves for all they can still do and we can't."</p>
<p>Finally, I got up. I went to the old man and I knelt in front of him. "I'm sorry I brought you over."</p>
<p>"It's okay," he said. "I knew you would. After all, I did it, sixty years ago."</p>
<p>I looked at my own eyes. Despite the wrinkles around them, they still looked pretty much the same. The old man 
shook his head and sniffed a tear away. "Now let's go back to your lab so you can send me back to my own time, 
so I can hate you in peace."</p>
<p>I hugged my own eighty year old version and leaned away and nodded. "I'll enjoy it," I said. "And I'll know I'm living in the good old days, I promise."</p>
<p>He got up with difficulty. "No, you won't," he said. "The good old days are only ever good when they're gone. That's what makes them good. When you're living through them, they're just... days."</p>
<p>He slow-stepped ahead of me towards the lab. Then he spoke without turning his head: "And days go by really fast, man. They go by really fast."</p>

<h4>[WP] You are legally allowed to commit murder once, but you must fill out the proper paperwork and your proposed victim will be notified of your intentions</h4>
<p>Score: 4938</p>
<p>I thought I'd get there early, beat the lines.  The Department of Legal Homicide opened at 9am.  9am was a foreign concept to me.  Sometimes, in my insomniac's stupor, as dusk turned to deep, purple night and then back to rosy dawn, I'd imagine people waking up, making coffee, reading the paper, sitting down to toast.  A life like that might as well have been on another planet.  But still, I found myself getting into my car at half past eight, groggy, yes, but thrilled, invigorated with the light of the morning sun and the thought of death.</p>
<p>I pulled into the DLH parking lot at 8:50.  The line was already halfway down the block.  I knew that the program, since being put to a vote and passed late last year, was popular, but I still wasn't expecting this.  I also wasn't expecting the sort of people I saw standing there, on a bright morning, hungry for blood.  I'd expected dark souls, vagabonds, transients with tattooed knuckles and stringy black hair.  But there were put together young men, in button-down shirts and khakis.  There were old men, grey hair, stooped, in dingy corduroys, who looked like their years of bloodlust should have been well behind them.</p>
<p>And then there were the women.  Young, beautiful women with golden hair and perfect skin, buzzing with life.  And old, matronly women with deep creases on their faces, the kind you'd expect to make amazing soup from an ancient, secret recipe.  The kind that has taught half the world's daughters how to love, and hate.  And there I was, at the DLH, like a child getting his first driver's permit: scared, ecstatic, and relieved.  I was so close.</p>
<p>Once inside, the line shortened.  At the front of the queue was a single desk, with a single uniformed employee sitting behind it.  They asked for my I.D., and handed me a form on a clipboard.  She also gave me a number.  "They'll call you shortly.  Please have the paperwork filled out by the time you're called, or you will forfeit your place in line."</p>
<p>With that, I took a seat on a hard, plastic chair.  The form was straightforward: My name and address, my intended victim's name and address, and a place to sign on the bottom.  That was all.  No reason for killing, no place to list my grievances, nothing.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an eternity, my number was called.  The agent in charge of my case looked over my paperwork, signed their name next to mine and stamped the form with a huge, heavy stamp that exuded importance.</p>
<p>"You're all set," they said.</p>
<p>"That's it?"</p>
<p>"That's it."</p>
<p>"And, they'll know it's happening?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we will notify them for you."</p>
<p>"How do you do it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"They'll get a certified letter.  Do they know to expect it?"</p>
<p>"They do, yes."</p>
<p>"Good," the agent replied, "That makes things easier."</p>
<p>"Have you seen a case like this before?" I asked.  I didn't know why I was prolonging the conversation, but there was something comforting about the agent's stark, bureaucratic formality.</p>
<p>"Yes.  It's quite common, actually.  We have a whole file set aside for patricide." </p>
<p>With that, a wave of relief swept over me.  There were others.  Many others, waking up early, making toast, reading the newspaper.  Others, living their entire, normal lives, waiting for the moment, the exact perfect moment, to kill their fathers.</p>
<p>I took my paperwork and left.  I was full of life, leaving the DLH with an exuberance I hadn't felt in years.  I don't remember a single thing about the drive to my father's house.  I could have run every red light without knowing it.  It wasn't until I pulled into his driveway that the gravity of the situation hit me.  That this was finally happening.</p>
<p>I've never lost the key to his house, and pulling it out on his front porch, I was overcome with a sense of nostalgia.  This key, this tool of entry from one world to another: a secret you share with only those you love and trust.  This was one of the last times I'd be using it.  Just one more tie to sever.  It fit easily in the lock.</p>
<p>I walked through the living room.  None of the lights were on.  I could already smell death in this house, he'd been dragging his fetid robes across the tattered carpets for months already. Waiting, like I'd waited, impatiently, hungrily.</p>
<p>I turned into his bedroom.  There he was, in his grey room, on his grey bed, the mattress bowed in the middle like a hammock.  It was quiet, except for the repeated, mechanical hiss and whirr of the ventilator.  I sat next to him, looked into his cloudy blue eyes.  I thought, for a second, he recognized me, but I could never be sure anymore.  I kissed him lightly on the forehead.  I said "I love you."  Then I unplugged the machine.</p>
<p>Walking out, into the bright light of day, I saw a pair of morning doves on a telephone wire.  I heard a dog bark.  I saw cars coming and going in their busy ways.  I felt everything.  I took it all in.  And it was fine. </p>

<p>Edit2: I woke up to an inbox full of nice things. Thank you!</p>

<h4>[WP] You obtain a device that tells you exactly what choices to make in order to lead the "happiest" life possible. Some of these choices get hard to make.</h4>
<p>Score: 4926</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now say that you won't just kill <strong>them</strong>. You'll also kill <strong>their families</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stared at the words on the terminal in disbelief. My hands hovered over the keyboard. I wanted to reply, but... holy shit. How do you respond to an order like that??</p>
<p>"I can't do that!" I typed back. The keys clacked as I wrote it; the keyboard was very old. The computer and all the hardware was an old Tandy Color Computer back from 1981. You'd think I would have upgraded by now, but my Oracle preferred to stay in here. And who am I to question its orders? In nearly forty years, it really hadn't ever steered me wrong. So we stayed with this one. Everyone thought I was weird for keeping it in my office, but I just explained it away as nostalgia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You won't <strong>actually</strong> have to kill their families. You just have to threaten them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Oh, well that's so much better</em>, I thought. <em>Just threaten to murder innocent women and children. No big deal</em>.</p>
<p>"You know what," I wrote back, practically pounding on the ancient beige keyboard, "That's it. That's it, Oracle. I'm done with this whole thing. I quit." My hands shook as I wrote it, and my heart was hammering against my ribs. I'd wanted to do it for so long, but I just never could work up the courage to let go. </p>
<p>Oracle had guided me through life since I first got the computer in the 80s. Some kid at Radio Shack told me it would give me good life advice and sold it to me on a floppy disk for two dollars, and I've never been one to pass up a good deal. I figured that at worst, it was just some piece of junk that wouldn't really do anything. This was before viruses and malware were really a thing. So I popped in the disk, and it told me that I should start brushing my teeth twice a day instead of just once. </p>
<p>Every day, it was a new piece of advice. Just little things to begin with, like changing up my hairstyle or whatever, but it eventually gained my trust and started meddling more and more with my life. It gave me business advice, stock tips, real estate intelligence, and relationship advice that was always sound. Years later, I've got more money than I ever thought I could make, and I've got a beautiful family. A gorgeous wife, five wonderful children, a great job that I really enjoy... I've got everything. Fame and fortune, with none of the drug problems and mental breakdowns that usually seem to go along with those two. And yet the Oracle kept pushing. It told me that my life could always get better. That it knew exactly what to do. And so I listened. I followed along blindly, and it's led down a dark path to this. </p>
<p>Oracle has made me do terrible things. I've destroyed people's careers, I've humiliated people, said horrible, nasty things that I really didn't mean... but this? Threatening to <em>kill</em> someone's family? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you leave now, it will all be wasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words flashed on Oracle's screen in dull green. There should be a name for that greenish color from before computer monitors could actually display real colors. I'd call it "80's green."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything that you've built will crumble. You know that I am right. And you can make the <strong>world</strong> a better place if you just follow my orders. I've never let you down before. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should have just left right then and there. I could have stood up from the chair and walked out of the room and never looked at Oracle again. Just spent the rest of my life lounging on a sunny beach in Florida or something. But I didn't. I hesitated.</p>
<p>That night, I got up on stage and took the mic in front of thousands of cheering fans. "And we're not just going to hunt down those terrorist bastards in ISIS," I shouted. "We're gonna go after their families, too!" My stomach churned just uttering the words: I was suggesting a <em>war crime</em> like it was a good thing! But of course, the crowds ate it up. Hell, they'd applaud for anything I did nowadays. I could probably shoot someone on 5th avenue and they'd cheer. Once the thunderous wave of clapping died down, I spoke into the mic again. "Thank you, Iowa! Let's make America great again!"</p>

<h4>[wp] after dying god informs you that hell is a myth, and "everyone sins, its ok". instead the dead are sorted into six "houses of heaven" based on the sins they chose.</h4>
<p>Score: 4915</p>
<p>We arrived first at the House of Lust. "House" is a misleading term. It was more of a camp, spread over acres and acres of lush forest. There was a white sandy beach (nude, of course) full of copulating couples. There were little cabins sprinkled all along the path, from which orgasmic moans regularly came belting out. Men with six pack abs and women with perky breasts strolled by without even noticing me and God. They only had eyes for each other, tickling and pinching each other with flirtatious giggles. </p>
<p>"What do you think?" God asked as we passed a nineteen-way taking place in a pool of champagne. Little cherubs flitted overhead armed with mops and cleaning supplies, thankfully. "Lust is our most popular sin." I eyed the supermodel-like figures of a couple passing nearby, and could easily see why. "You can look however you want. Hell, you can be whatever gender you want. No fetish is too taboo, and no desire can be denied here."</p>
<p>It was <em>quite</em> tempting, but I wasn't ready to make a permanent decision here. "Let's see the others," I told God.</p>
<p>We carried on to Greed. We passed rows and rows of mansions, each more opulent than the next. Some of them were so large that they would have had enough bed rooms to fit my entire hometown. And so many different styles: one second, we were in a beautiful French vineyard in front of a gorgeous chateau with the Alps in the background. The next second, a warm tropical beach with a modern mansion atop breathtaking cliffs. After that, a ski chalet in Colorado with a roaring fire in a hearth large enough to fit an ox. Each one had various Italian sports cars and Rolls Royces parked in front, with the occasional smattering of boats, helicopters, etc. </p>
<p>"Any material desire you ever wanted," God explained. "Your own world, where you can have everything. You want the Hope Diamond? You can fly to Washington DC in your own solid gold helicopter and buy it from the Smithsonian. Hell, you can just <em>buy</em> the Smithsonian."</p>
<p>Also tempting, but I decided to keep looking. </p>
<p>Gluttony was next up. Tables and tables of the very finest foods: beautiful steaks cooked medium rare; butter-poached lobster tail; fresh oysters on a half shell; exotic wines in dusty bottles that had been hiding in the cellars of the world's finest restaurants. Everyone had a glass of champagne in hand and simply lounged on couches and chairs near the tables, eating endlessly. As soon as the inhabitants took a bite, the food just instantly came back. My mouth watered even <em>watching</em> them.</p>
<p>"In every other House, the food is practically <em>sawdust</em> compared to Gluttony," God explained. "You haven't truly experienced heaven until you've been to Gluttony."</p>
<p>I shook my head, and we kept moving. </p>
<p>Sloth was as you'd expect. An endless sea of the softest mattresses, stacked with cushions and pillows that made the story of the princess and the pea seem minimalist. Little angels visited each resident, giving them massages that made them all melt into their blankets. </p>
<p>Wrath was... well, a lot like what I'd expect Hell to be like. Fire, brimstone, whips, torture.. you know, the works. Except here, you weren't the one being tortured. Every enemy you'd ever made in your real life was now under your thumb. "Lots of people choose their fathers," God explained. "Lots of grudges against parents in general, you know. But you're not limited to that. Someone beat you out for a big promotion back on Earth? Take your pound of flesh here."</p>
<p>Then we arrived at Envy. It looked... well, a lot like home. </p>
<p>"Go on in," God said, gesturing toward the door. I turned the knob and walked in... and found Emily waiting inside. She ran forward, wrapped her arms around my neck, and planted a kiss right on my lips. "Welcome home, honey."</p>
<p>I looked back toward God. "Oh, don't be coy," he said. "You have no secrets from me. We all know that you were in love with your best friend's wife." She didn't seem to hear him at all; she went back into the hall. "We all know that you just <em>settled</em> for your own wife while secretly pining after her. Well, this is your chance to live happily ever after."</p>
<p>I peered into the kitchen. Emily was baking something, wearing nothing but an apron. Her curly black hair fell softly over her shoulder as she whisked ingredients. She turned back, noticed I was observing her, and an enthusiastic smile spread across her face. </p>
<p>"It's what you've always wanted, isn't it?" God whispered in my ear. </p>
<p>I wanted to take it. God <em>damn</em> did I want to take it. But I shook my head.</p>
<p>God seemed puzzled. "You need to make a decision," he told me. </p>
<p>"I haven't seen Pride yet."</p>
<p>He scoffed. "No one ever wants Pride, trust me."</p>
<p>"Well, I want to see it."</p>
<hr />
<p>Pride was boring. Just a row of workbenches in a bare white room.</p>
<p>"I don't get it," I told God.</p>
<p>"Yeah, no one does," he answered. "That's why no one ever chooses it. Doesn't cavorting in Lust sound better than sitting here building little trinkets for the rest of eternity? Wouldn't you rather gorge yourself in Gluttony? Or spend time with Emily in Envy?"</p>
<p>I considered the options again. "I pick Pride," I finally told him. </p>
<p>He narrowed his eyes. "<em>What?</em> Look at it!" He gestured around the room again. There wasn't much to look at. "Why would you choose <em>this</em> for the rest of time?"</p>
<p>"Because you <em>don't</em> want me to pick it," I told him. If he was really God, he'd know what a contrarian I can be. And I knew he was hiding something, trying to pretend like Pride didn't exist. There was something special about it.</p>
<p>God scowled back. "Fine." He led me over to one of the workbenches. In the center, there was a black space. A blank, empty void that went on forever. "Here's your universe," he said. "You've got seven days to get started." He took his seat at the bench next to me and went back to tinkering in his own world. After a long pause, he finally spoke again: "You know, it might be nice for me to actually have some company for once."</p>

<h4>[WP] Wikipedia is shut down and all copies deleted for lack of funds and loss of net neutrality. This is the founder's "I warned you, jerks" notification.</h4>
<p>Score: 4804</p>
<p>Dear Wikipedia Readers: We’ll get right to it. We’ve never asked for much, maybe a few dollars here and there—to be honest, we've averaged maybe $15 in donations. That’s it. Did you know that 99% of other charities average $15,000 <em>per day</em>? Probably not, because we made that statistic up. Do you know why we made it up? We’re pretty sure you know why we made that up. </p>
<p>We want to make it abundantly clear that we at Wikipedia tried our best to keep our website a non-profit. For over a decade, we’ve run and maintained the largest free encyclopedia in existence, never once portraying so much as a single advertisement on any of our millions of pages. Do you remember the days of Encyclopedia Britannica, where you’d need to hire several burly, Swedish bodybuilders to lug half the compilation to your Psychology 101 class, just so that you could understand who the hell Sigmund Freud was? Probably not, because that was almost a hundred years ago. Is that date completely and utterly made up? Absolutely, but you know why. However, if for some reason you haven’t caught on yet, keep reading.</p>
<p>Here at Wikipedia, we, the editors, made our requests simple and clear: we just needed $3 from some of our visitors once every few years. That’s it. Three dollars. With that, we could’ve kept running for decades. Yet a total of fourteen of you donated this year, giving us a result of $74.32 raised (and to the jerk who sent 32 cents, thanks for costing us money to receive your donation). Do you know how much you spend on Starbucks every week? $27. You spend twenty-seven dollars on Starbucks. Every. Single. Week. Is that statistic made up? Yes. Do you know why it’s made up? We’re positive you do.</p>
<p>As many of you are aware, Net Neutrality was struck down this year, resulting in heavily increased costs for Wikipedia to maintain its servers and remain equally accessible to all Internet Service Providers. As such, we at Wikipedia were met with a difficult choice: either we could put a few banner advertisements on the website, which would net us millions—if not billions—of dollars, but sacrifice our integrity and the reliability of our content; or we could depend on you, our trusted, loyal visitors, to donate less than a tenth of your weekly paycheck. As we had such blind faith in our beloved users, we decided to decline all advertisement offers and move forward with our previous plan of funding: donations. After all, we’ve always survived on the measly funds gained by you, our greedy, selfish users. </p>
<p>In order to continue functioning as a company, we at Wikipedia, a non-profit library of endless information, needed to raise a total of $3,000,000. We raised $74.32. Seventy-four thirty-two. The average 14 year old child makes twice that in a single day of basketball. Is that fact actually a completely made up statement? It absolutely, positively is. Yet here’s the issue: due to the fact that none of you donated more than what a hypothetical, athletic child earns, Wikipedia has officially closed its doors as a non-profit as of December 10th, 2014. You can no longer trust statistics that were once reliably provided by us through our pages. That’s right, we’re done, out, closed. It’s over.</p>
<p>“But Wikipedia, I’m on your site right now. I’m reading this notice on your website this very moment.” Great observation, Captain. You are a very astute learner. You are most certainly on Wikipedia right now. Yet you might notice something a bit strange about it. For example, have you taken note of the fact that every single page now incorporates references to Comcast and their excellent products, and those that don’t simply redirect to Comcast’s Wikipedia page (heavily edited by their glorious lawyers)? Why don’t you go ahead and search the word “Cats.” Do it, we’ll wait. </p>
<p>Have you searched it yet? Great. Did you know that the average feline prefers Comcast’s XFINITY^® to Verizon? Of course they do, it’s just a better product all around—Wikipedia clearly explains that. How about the fact that the most common cat in the United States is the XFINITY Triple Play™? “That doesn’t make any sense” you say? Well, according to Wikipedia-Comcast^® it most certainly does. </p>
<p>We here at Wikipedia-Comcast^® are proud to announce our long-awaited merger with Comcast, allowing us to become a publicly traded company and fully incorporate their great line of products and services into any and all encyclopedia entries. Reading a great excerpt on Shakespeare’s beloved tragedy <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>? You may just be lucky enough to find a fantastic coupon to save 10% on your already low monthly Comcast bill. Checking out the results from the 1972 World Series? Whoa—a free month of HBO on Comcast’s renowned television services! Of course, this also means that all Wikipedia pages are no longer editable. Our lawyers also want us to mention that all Wikipedia pages have been stripped of citations that have not approved by Comcast and that all entries should no longer be taken as fact, although they certainly will be chock-full of money saving offers from Comcast. </p>
<p>Wikipedia-Comcast^® would like to thank you for the decades of experiences you, our loyal, devoted fans, have granted us. For more than half of our average user’s life, we have stood by you, supported you through your education, allowed you to plagiarize your way through college and beyond. We are eternally grateful for the opportunity to have assisted you, and would like to conclude our farewell on a very simple, basic note. For a limited time, sign up for Comcast’s XFINITY Triple Play™ using the code “Wikipedia” to automatically be updated to the “HD Preferred” package, a $199/month value for just $189/month. </p>

<p>She reached out for the ringing phone.  For a moment, her stiff fingers fumbled over the buttons, and she cursed the arthritis that stiffened her joints.  She managed to hit the green button, and lifted the handset up to her ear.</p>
<p>"Hello?"</p>
<p>"Hello - I, uh, I just needed to talk to someone.  I don't think I can keep going any longer."</p>
<p>Another one of them.  No matter how many calls she took, there always seemed to be more of them, each with their little problems, so convinced that no one else in the world had ever experienced what they were now going through.  Her eyes drifted over to the two piles of stationary on her windowsill.</p>
<p>"Well, you can talk to me, although you best make it quick - I'm 92, so who knows how much time I've got left."  She settled back into her chair, trying to find a more comfortable position for the phone against her ear.</p>
<p>"92?  Um, is... is this the suicide hotline?"  </p>
<p>Ah, one of the faster ones.  He'd caught on more quickly than some of the callers.  "Afraid not, dear," she replied.  "You're off by a number."</p>
<p>"Oh.  Er, shit."</p>
<p>"Happens more often than you'd think."  She looked around her little bedroom, at the cards on her windowsill, the little bed, the faded pictures.  "But you've got me up, now, so you might as well talk to me.  Otherwise, you'll have roused an old woman from her nap for nothing, and you won't want to die with that hanging over you, would you?"</p>
<p>"Um, no, of course not!  I'm so sorry, miss-"</p>
<p>"Cleo."  She tried propping one arm up on the side of the chair.</p>
<p>"Your name is Miss Cleo?" </p>
<p>"Are you sassing me, young man?" she snapped, her frail voice suddenly surprisingly sharp.</p>
<p>"No, no, of course not.  Um, sorry, Mi- sorry, Cleo.  But I haven't been able to find work for three months, and I'm about to be homeless, and I guess that I was just thinking about ending-"</p>
<p>"You know, you sound a little like my husband," she said dreamily.  "He always had such a soft voice, sounded so vulnerable.  When he met me in person for the first time, I couldn't believe that it was the same man.  But he was going through troubles, too."</p>
<p>"Oh.  What troubles?"  </p>
<p>"The usual - he'd fallen hard for me, but he didn't have a job or a dollar to his name, and he was certain that I wouldn't look twice at him."  She smiled a little to herself.  "He was an idiot, of course.  Didn't ever give himself credit."</p>
<p>"How did he turn things around?  Um, if you don't mind me asking, of course."</p>
<p>"Oh, young man, I'm just happy to be talking to someone.  He nearly didn't turn things around, but I snapped at him, told him that he was a little shit if he expected things to fall into his lap without effort.  Oh, you should have seen his face - I don't think anyone had ever raised their voice to him, much less a dainty little gal like me!"  She laughed, and the voice on the phone laughed with her.</p>
<p>"And he turned things around, then?  Made something of himself?"</p>
<p>"It took some time," she reflected.  With a grunt, she pulled herself up out of her chair, walking over to the windowsill of her little room.  "He went through plenty of failures.  But he loved me, and he hated coming home to a tongue lashing from me, so he kept on trying!"</p>
<p>"Wow."  A pause.  "I don't have anyone in my life like that, I guess."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't have my husband any longer, so that makes us even," she snapped at him.  The windowsill was littered with cards.  On one side, the cards stood propped up, a display of bright colors, all clashing against each other.  On the other side, the cards were plain white, sorted into a neat stack.  "But it wasn't just me - it was the way he looked at things after I set him straight."</p>
<p>"What was that, then?"</p>
<p>She picked up one of the bright cards, smiling as she read the kind words hand-written inside.  "He thought that he should quit before things got worse.  But I pointed out to him that it's not whether we fall or rise, but where we're at when we check out.  I pointed at him, and said, 'do you want to walk up to them pearly gates and admit that you didn't make every attempt you could to better yourself?'"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I don't know what else I can-"</p>
<p>"Oh, you sound so like him," she interrupted, setting the bright card down.  She liked re-reading those bright cards.  "Always hoping for the lazy way out."</p>
<p>"I'm not lazy, Cleo-"</p>
<p>"Of course not, but only a lazy man refuses to see a job through to its very end," she countered him.  "And years later, my husband returned home every night, happy with his hard work, showing me a lesson by telling me of how he'd fought for every success."  She ran her finger over another bright card.  "He never caught on that this was my plan all along, that lovable man."</p>
<p>"If..."</p>
<p>She waited.  Her eyes drifted to the plain white cards, but she didn't want to jinx anything.</p>
<p>"If I managed to succeed at something, could I come tell you about it?"</p>
<p>There it was.  She smiled, happily taking her eyes off of the plain white cards.  "Well, of course you could, dear.  You sound like a very nice young man.  I'll give you my nursing home address, but you'd best work hard - I don't know how much longer I have."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you'll be around for plenty longer, Cleo, with that sharp mind."</p>
<p>"Flattery will get you nowhere, young man," she replied, but smiled as she said it.  "Now, what's your name?"</p>
<p>"Uh, it's John."</p>
<p>"Well, I expect a card from you, John," she told him.  "Something nice, with a real comment from you written inside.  Nothing silly or inappropriate, mind you."</p>
<p>"You got it, Cleo.  I'll send you one.  I promise."</p>
<p>"Then I'll let you go, John.  Have a good rest of your day now, you hear?"  She smiled, glaring triumphantly at the pile of white cards.  Not today, she thought.</p>
<p>"You too, Cleo.  And thank you."</p>
<p>She lowered the phone, carefully putting it back in the cradle to charge.  Hopefully, another bright card would come soon.  John sounded like a nice man, she thought to herself.  He could get better.</p>
<p>And with his card, she'd have forty-eight bright cards, to the twenty-four white cards.  Double.</p>
<p>She didn't know if it would be enough, if it would ever be enough.  She picked up one of those white cards, her fingers trembling slightly as she traced the ornate script.  </p>
<p>"We are saddened to invite you to the funeral of..." she read, before she had to put the card down.</p>
<p>Twenty-four failures.  Each one weighed at her, dragging her down.  Twenty-four callers for whom she'd been too late.</p>
<p>But John sounded promising.  She looked forward to his card.</p>

<h4>[WP] A father and son sit down for a serious talk. The father is going to tell the son he is the last of an ancient race, and must carry on the bloodline. the son is coming out to the father. neither knows what the other has to say.</h4>
<p>Score: 4744</p>
<p>We sat in the living room, me, perched in the middle of the colossal green couch, my father, in the beaten-tan lazyboy. I wan't sure where to begin. My father, though, beat me to it.</p>
<p>“<em>Hrm</em>. Well, son, you might have noticed that you have certain…<em>qualities</em> that other boys your age don’t have…”</p>
<p>I was... a little surprised. “So, wait, Dad. <em>You know about me?!</em>”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’m one too!”</p>
<p>Agog, I sputtered out. “But-but, <em>but does Mom know</em>?!” </p>
<p>“Of course she knows! She’s even gone on a few <em>adventures</em> with me! We’d mix it up all the time.”</p>
<p><em>Adventures?! Oh God, was that what they called it?</em> “She was <em>ok</em> with it!?”</p>
<p>“Sure. She was quite the enchantress, back then. Her techniques were <em>incredible</em>, let me tell you. I got to see them firsthand. She'd make a mess out of a room of men in <em>seconds flat</em>”</p>
<p><em>Oh God, if you’ve ever loved me, you will</em> <strong>kill me now</strong>. <em>Kill me, before I hear about my bi father’s sexcapades.</em></p>
<p>“Yes son, I know all about it. I just want you to know that what you’re going through now is normal. Those strange feelings you’re having aren’t in your head. But, there will be people who don’t understand you.”</p>
<p>I thought about Greg, how I’d misunderstood his pranks as affection. How he’d reacted, and the pain of rejection. How Michael had seen and accepted me, and how Laura saw to it that I was kicked off of the Homecoming Council.</p>
<p>“In the days to come, you might find it easier to not tell anyone what you really are. If you do decide that, I want you to know that no one can judge you. You will have every right to live your life <em>how you want to</em>, without regard for people like <em>them</em>, or even people <em>like me.</em>. But’ I hope you’ll find a few people to share this with. It helps. And I want you to know, however you choose to live your life, your mother and me will love you, <em>always.</em>”</p>
<p>My eyes started to water, cutting through the heat of shame.</p>
<p>“Also, there are going to be people who might want to hurt you because of what you are. And there will probably be people who will… <em>want things</em> from you, too. I know you’re strong, but if you ever need it, come to us for help.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Right, ok! I have to admit, I’m surprised you worked all this out for yourself already! It took me forever to awaken!”</p>
<p>“<em>Ughhh</em>, DAD.”</p>
<p>“What? I’m just proud of my boy!”</p>
<p>“That’s weird, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Nothing weird about it! It’s who you are! So, have you already experimented a bit?”</p>
<p>I thought of Mike, and the smell of his leather jacket.</p>
<p>“A little, yeah.”</p>
<p>“Right, ok. Well, you’ve probably worked out that you’ll do best with <em>rods</em>-“</p>
<p>“<em>Dad.</em>”</p>
<p>“-Staffs, staves-“</p>
<p>“<em>DAD.</em>”</p>
<p>“-even <em>wands</em>, if the situation calls for it-“</p>
<p>“<em>OH MY GOD</em>, <strong>DAD!</strong>”</p>
<p>“But you’ll figure out pretty soon that you can even use <em>just your hands</em> if you don’t have anything else to work with-.“</p>
<p>My flush of embarrassment had gone <em>nuclear</em>.</p>
<p>“JESUS SHIT, DAD! I <em>know</em>!”</p>
<p>“You do?! Wow, you’re <em>very advanced</em> for your age! I didn’t even gain mastery over the tongues of men until I was 19!”</p>
<p><em>…I was going to burn my way to the center of the Earth.</em> </p>
<p>I would. I would melt a hole, <em>seven thousand miles straight down</em>, and live there forever. That would be my home; far, <em>far</em> away from this conversation.</p>
<p>“Daaad, could you… please… not…”</p>
<p>“<em>OH!</em> I’m sorry. I’m embarrassing you. I’m just <em>so proud</em>.”</p>
<p><em>This is worse. This is worse than disowning.</em> </p>
<p>“And the good news is, this means we can have the ceremony sooner than we expected!”</p>
<p><em>WHAT.</em></p>
<p>“What ceremony?!”</p>
<p>“Your unveiling! It makes it all official, amongst us in the ‘underworld.’ “</p>
<p>“There’s a <em>ceremony</em> for that?!”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! It’s very important! We show proof of your nature to your <em>peers</em>, so you’ll be accorded full status!”</p>
<p>“…<em>What kind of proof.</em>”</p>
<p>“Oh, you know, a few <em>minor acts.</em> A practical demonstration. Don’t worry, the audience is very supportive. You might even recognize a few of them from school! Mike will be there, you know. He’s secretly a bear-man. He <em>really impressed</em> at his unveiling last year.”</p>
<p>My brain shut down.</p>
<p>“And then, after that, I’ll take out the family <em>crown and scepter</em>-“</p>
<p>I could only listen on, in mounting horror.</p>
<p>“-declaring you the true, last heir of the <em>King of the Fairies!</em>”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>My soul left my body. I saw a bright light.</p>
<p>“And then you can begin pursuing your destiny, protecting the land of Eld from monsters!”</p>
<p>I whiplashed back into the real world. “Wait. What about… what?!”</p>
<p>“You’ll really knock ‘em <em>dead</em>, son! Damn, but I’m <em>excited!</em> I’m gonna go get my robe right now!”</p>
<p>He flitted out of the room on a pair of iridescent, gossamer wings.</p>
<p>“…<em>what?</em>”</p>

<h4>[WP] New arrivals in eternal Hell may choose either of the following: a small wooden spoon, or a 100-trillion year vacation in Heaven.</h4>
<p>Score: 4349</p>
<p>"So it's meant to be, what, an agonizing choice? A huge dilemma? A source of eternal regret?" Leems asked. After an eternity on Acid Mine Supervision, he had finally been promoted to Reception, and wanted to be sure he understood what was going on.</p>
<p>"For some of them, yes. I think you might be overestimating how many actually think things through," Ebnerzaz replied, in his British basso. The supervisor of Reception stood an impressive twelve feet tall, and Leems had to scurry quickly in front of him to avoid his trashcan-lid-sized cloven hooves. Some said he had been chosen because the arriving souls often mistook him for the Prince of Darkness Himself.</p>
<p>"Ah, so you're saying that most of them choose the aeons-long vacation with The Enemy then," Leems wheezed. "They don't even give it a second thought, eh? 'Why would I pick a spoon when I can spend a hundred trillion years in heaven?'"</p>
<p>"Precisely," Ebnerzaz said, as they exited the vast hallway into a much vaster cavern. Its impressive collection of stalactites was sheathed in a constantly-churning haze, the better to frustrate anyone trying to enjoy the scenery. Management thought of everything.</p>
<p>"So what's our angle, then? If they get such pleasure from the vacation..."</p>
<p>"It makes it all the more crushing when they come back and realize that it was quite literally nothing compared to the length of time they'll be spending here. All subsequent torment is therefore enriched. Set the papers down there, if you would," Ebnerzaz said, as he found his desk. Leems stood on tiptoe to deposit the loose sheath of parchment in the supervisor's In box.</p>
<p>"Aha, so the correct choice, then, is the spoon?" he asked, looking around for his own desk.</p>
<p>The senior devil gave a condescending grin. "This is Hell, Leems. There is no correct choice."</p>
<p>"But..." Leems began.</p>
<p>"Our shift is starting. I'll answer any further questions when we have our break. Off you go," Ebnerzaz said, his massive clawed hand steering Leems' shoulders towards the empty desk he would be working at.</p>
<p>Leems hurried over to the protruding stone just in time for the flow of souls to shamble up to him, all of them shaved bald and clothed in itchy rags. "Welcome to Hell! You may have one amenity - a hundred trillion year vacation in heaven, starting right now, or a small wooden spoon." He offered the choice to each one of them, and saw that Ebnerzaz's assessment was even truer than he'd thought - thousands upon thousands chose the Heavenly vacation, no questions asked. As soon as they did, they vanished in a puff of light, leaving a lavender scent that clashed horribly with the dominant smell of brimstone.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the souls stopped long enough to think through the choice, his dark brow furrowing in concentration. "If you're offering me this, that means it's reasonable to choose the spoon, right? They're on a par with each other, right?" he said slowly.</p>
<p>Leems just smiled, not knowing the answer himself.</p>
<p>"So I know everybody in front of me chose Heaven. That can't be what you want. So let me think. It's eternal down here, right? So no matter how long the vacation is, it's not even a drop in the bucket. So let's think about it utilitarian-like. I can get real happy for a tiny amount of time, big-picture. Or I can choose the spoon, and it'll make me just a tiny bit happy, but for an infinite amount of time. Right?" he said eagerly. Once again, Leems didn't respond. "Oh, and what's more, once the vacation's over, I bet I'll regret I didn't choose the spoon. That'll make me even more unhappy. I'll never know what I'm missing out on if I don't go to heaven! But the spoon... that'll last me forever. No regrets there!"</p>
<p>"Are you quite done?" Leems asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah. I'm done. I'm pickin' the spoon," the soul said triumphantly.</p>
<p>Leems nodded, and pulled open the stone drawer in his desk with a scraping sound. Inside were hundreds of tiny wooden spoons, each not much bigger than a finger. He selected one and handed it to the soul, who eagerly grabbed it, before turning to the left to exit through one of the many gaping caves in the cavern wall.</p>
<p>The encounter stuck with Leems all through the shift, as he let thousands more souls poof into heaven. Finally, it was break time - the gates closed and the remaining lines disappeared. The horde of demons working Reception left their desks and swarmed over to the break area, to consume sulfurous coffee and rotting meat.</p>
<p>Leems sought out the hulking form of Ebnerzaz, and tugged on the supervisor's wings. "Ah, Leems! How did your first shift go? Keeping up the pace, I hope?" he asked, peering down at the smaller demon.</p>
<p>"Yes, it went very well, sir. But I did have one soul choose... the spoon."</p>
<p>"Ah, on your first day! Congratulations. It took me a week, way back when. But why are you looking so troubled?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's just... he stopped and thought about it, like you said some of them might. And his reasoning seemed pretty ironclad. If the spoon gives them a small amount of pleasure forever, is that not categorically better than a finite vacation in heaven?" Leems asked. "I thought you said there were no correct choices. I feel as though, by giving him the spoon, I have reduced the amount of suffering we'll generate."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, Leems. Do not worry. The spoon will generate plenty of suffering in due time."</p>
<p>"But how?"</p>
<p>"Because, dear Leems," Ebnerzaz said, smiling his most terrifying smile yet. "When did you ever hear of a simple wooden spoon that stays intact forever?"</p>

<h4>[WP] Michael, a 15 year old Call of Duty player, realizes the greatest trash-talking opportunity of all time. Over his headset, he recognizes his opponent's voice as that of President Obama.</h4>
<p>Score: 4312</p>
<p>You'd think that the Secret Service would have some clue about combat tactics, but apparently not. They were all bunched up around the President as bullet shields, and weren't even moving while Obama did his best to line up a sniper shot. One grenade was all it took, giving me an amazing killstreak and finally earning me a gunship. </p>
<p>"Very good move, XxXBlahzeItFahGetXxX," a voice came over the mic. He pronounced "Blahze" as "blasé" and "Fahget" like a Bostonian trying to say "Forget." But I hardly even noticed that at the time because I realized <em>it was Barack FUCKING Obama!</em> "You really got me there."</p>
<p>I was too excited to even contain myself. Holy crap, what an opportunity! I could <em>make history</em> here; this was my modern-day Boston Tea Party! I was wracked with indecision: what slur do I start with? Racial would be the obvious choice, but he's probably desensitized to it by now. Maybe some good "pillowbiters" and the classic standby "faggot." But those are all just so... played out. I needed something brand new. Something that would <em>wow</em> everyone when the audio was eventually released. Speaking of which, I ordered the in-game recording to start. </p>
<p>Finally, I had it. The perfect insult. "Hey, Obama!" I said into the mic. "Get ready to get rekt, you fucking queer..."</p>
<p>"Shut your pre-pubescent little fuckwad mouth!" he shouted back. "I'm going to fuck your mom so hard tonight that you'll <em>retroactively</em> become black! She won't be able to sit down for <em>weeks</em>. You think I'm kidding, you little bitch? I'm the most powerful man on the planet!" What followed was the most horrendous tirade of slurs and insults that I'd ever heard in my entire life. I couldn't have interrupted even if I wanted to. It was like the man didn't even stop to take a breath for Christ's sake. He was still shouting at me even after the game ended, and I could just barely hear the secret service agents laughing in the background.</p>
<p>I quit the game, and my phone rang almost immediately showing my best friend's number on the caller ID. He was never going to believe what had happened.</p>
<p>"Hey Ja..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, you thought it was your gay lover Jason, didn't you, faggot? Well it's not, bitch! I've got the NSA on my side, what have you... <em>click</em>" I hung up on the President. He tried calling back as Jason again. Then as my grandmother. Then as the girl I had a crush on. I silenced the phone and threw it behind my bed and ran downstairs.</p>
<p>Mom was in the living room on her iPad. As soon as I entered, she jumped up and gave me a hug. "You're never going to believe it," she said. "We just received <em>an invitation to visit the White House</em> next week!" She showed me the email with the official .gov address and everything. "We're going to get to meet with President Obama!" she told me. "And it even says that he wants to 'have a one-on-one session' with me <em>personally</em>!"</p>
<p>I backed away slowly in horror, then ran up the stairs and bolted into my room. I fished my phone out from behind my bed and checked: 17 missed calls, and one text message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, you thought I was just shit-talking, didn't you? See you soon, bitch.</p>

<h4>[WP] Valhalla is filled with the strongest warriors the world has ever known. Vikings, Spartans, Mongols, Romans, Samurai, Spetznaz, JSOC Operators. And in that corner over there? That's Ted, from accounting.</h4>
<p>Score: 4286</p>
<p>One of the peculiarities about Valhalla was that time had no meaning.<br />
Warriors did not arrive in Valhalla chronologically, they arrived based on how glorious their battle prowess and their death had been.<br />
Högdar the Huge had just arrived in Valhalla, after mortally maiming twenty Englishmen and being shot through the heart by an arrow.<br />
The hall was just as vast as legend had foretold; the rafters disappearing in darkness and hazed by the thick smoke from the firepits that lined the hall.<br />
He quickly found some of his battle brothers from previous skirmishes and roared in greeting, immediately swapping tales of his deeds leading up to his death.<br />
The hall was not at all full, he noted; less than two thousand warriors of various races and genders filled the benches, eating, drinking and fighting.<br />
"I am pleased that I arrived early," he shouted to his companions, "who would want to be last into Valhalla? The shame would be unbearable!"<br />
His friends roared with laughter and thrust a horn of mead into his hand.<br />
As Högdar drank, his good eye roved over the assorted warriors. In one corner sat a group of strange men in green uniforms, patterned like a forest canopy. They leaned on unnatural looking weapons and sported gaudy, meaningless tattoos.<br />
"Marines," said Halfdan, "from the future. Great warriors - their leader was amongst the first to arrive in Valhalla."<br />
Högdar raised a scarred eyebrow and re-appraised the soldiers. Appearances could be deceiving.<br />
"Odin was first here, of course," continued Halfdan, "as he is the greatest warrior of all."<br />
Reaching for another horn, Högdar casually asked,<br />
"Who was second?"<br />
A sudden hush descended on the vast hall and Högdar felt unease creep up his spine like a spider made of frost.<br />
All eyes had turned to a secluded nook, far from the smoke, noise and heat, where a small man sat, clothed in black trousers and a neat white shirt and tie. His leather shoes were polished brightly and a pair of spectacles perched below a receding hairline and a brow full of worry lines.<br />
"I was," said Ted, from accounting.<br />
Högdar rose from the bench and drew his sword - still bloody with the ichor of his fallen foes.<br />
"WHAT JEST IS THIS?" he bellowed.<br />
"Shh! Högdar, my friend, sit <em>down!</em>" crooned Halfdan, "leave the man be."<br />
But the strong alcohol had begun to kick in and Högdar's blood was still hot from battle.<br />
"I WILL NOT! It is an insult to Odin, to my ancestors and to me that this <em>worm</em> of a man sits amongst the greatest warriors of all time!"<br />
A Mongolian horse archer in leather and fur armour stood, his steely, dead eyes boring into the agitated Viking,<br />
"Northman. You sit. Shut mouth."<br />
"Freya's tits I will!" Högdar shot back, brandishing his weapon, foam spraying from his lips.<br />
"You insult Ted." the stocky archer said flatly.<br />
"Aye, that I do! And what are you going to do about it, you slit-eyed horse-lover?"<br />
Högdar didn't even see Ted move.<br />
All he was aware of was that suddenly he couldn't feel the rest of his body and the ground was rapidly approaching.<br />
He stared up into the thin, pinched features and blue stubble of Ted's annoyed face.<br />
The small man pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and retrieved something from Högdar's neck.<br />
Ted wiped off his titanium Parker pen with a bloody handkerchief and regarded the paralysed Viking.<br />
"Didn't anyone ever tell you that the pen is mightier than the sword?"</p>

<h4>[WP] One night as you play Call of Duty a particularly squeaky voiced 12 year old gives out personal information leading you to discover he is your child from a long lost lover. You must now convince him you are his father and thus banged his mom, through Xbox live.</h4>
<p>Score: 4203</p>
<p>"Listen, Andrew," She'd sent me a letter with his name and a bunch of information about him, but I never thought it would lead to anything. Never thought I'd even remember the name of his school, and his best friend. And of all places, Xbox live? Who would have thought that I'd coincidentally find my own son, and that my first impression of him would be his username: 6969BongHitterX. And to add insult to injury, he was camping near a respawn point. I'd failed as a father.</p>
<p>"Faggot, I pwned you so hard! Listen to you cry!"</p>
<p>"I'm serious! Your mom... is her name Sarah? Is she blond, a nurse at the hospital? And her father owns Mike's Bistro in town?"</p>
<p>"Boom, headshot!" He wasn't listening to me; he'd gone back to running around the map looking for a new weapon. Had he muted me? Had I already lost my chance? </p>
<p>"Andrew, you need to listen." My character was following him around the map trying to get his attention. "Your mother..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I fucked your mother! I did it in your own basement, you neckbeard faggot!"</p>
<p>"I'm serious!" I shouted back to him as he shot my character yet again. I grumbled angrily, waiting to respawn and searching the map for him once more. "You need to listen to me! You live on Elm Avenue, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Who is this?" he squeaked into the microphone. I could hear the puberty in his voice. "Sam, is this you, you faggot? I'm going to kick your ass at school tomorrow, you little bitch!"</p>
<p>"Andrew, your mom has a tattoo of a rose on the back of her neck, doesn't she?"</p>
<p>His avatar stopped moving, and his microphone fell silent. Our characters stood looking at each other awkwardly until we were both splattered by another group driving a Warthog. Without another word, Andrew left the game. I sighed and signed out too. I guess it wasn't meant to be.</p>
<hr />
<p>"who is this?" the message said. </p>
<p>It had been days, but he hadn't even answered my friend request. Every night I debated whether I should just contact his mother again. Just talking to him, even through the game, made the whole thing so... <em>real</em>. Before that, he was just some kid that was out there somewhere. An abstract idea that I was sure was doing just fine without me. Sarah had made it clear that they didn't need me in their lives, and I was fine with that back then. I was more into drugs anyway. A lot had changed in twelve years.</p>
<p>"I know this is going to be weird... but I'm your father. I used to live in Perryville too, years and years ago. Your mom and I were both counselors at the same summer camp, and we just had one of those romances. But at the end of the summer, we just went our separate ways. I went off to college and she stuck around. And she didn't tell me I had a kid until a few years later. She sent me occasional letters and pictures of you, but I just.... I never thought about it too much until now. Would you maybe like to meet and talk about it sometime?"</p>
<p>My hands shook as I typed the question. Was I really ready for this? But it wasn't up to me at this point. The ball was in my son's court. </p>
<p>A week later, he answered: "ok."</p>
<hr />
<p>I waited nervously at the coffee shop. I'd driven eleven hours to meet Andrew, and I was a jittery mess, I'm sure. But that didn't matter. I could barely contain my excitement at being reunited. I briefly wondered whether Sarah would be with him. He hadn't mentioned telling her, but hopefully he was smart enough to not meet strangers off of the internet without even telling his mom. </p>
<p>The bell chimed, and I looked up immediately, as I had done the last dozen times someone entered the store. And this time, it was him. He wore faded jeans and an old t-shirt that might have actually been one of mine. Had his mother really saved it for all these years? </p>
<p>I stood up tentatively from behind the table. My legs didn't seem to be working very well, and I had to lean on the back of my chair for support. Our eyes met, and I instantly knew it was my son. The exact same shape and hazel shade that stared back at me through the mirror every morning. My lips quivered into a nervous smile. It was really happening. I was finally going to meet him. </p>
<p>"Andrew?" I asked. He nodded; there was just a hint of tears welling up in the corner of his eyes. </p>
<p>I didn't know what to do. Do we... shake hands? Hug? We approached each other awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Dad?" It was definitely the same voice I'd heard through the Xbox microphone.</p>
<p>I punched him straight in the face, so hard that it sent him reeling back against the door. A collective gasp rose from the horrified barista and the shocked patrons of the coffeeshop.</p>
<p>"Headshot, you little bastard! No scope!"</p>
<p>He slumped to the floor, clutching at his bleeding nose. And as I crowed with victory, I teabagged the little faggot.</p>

<h4>[WP] A Man gets to paradise. Unfortunately, Lucifer won the War in Heaven ages ago. What is the man's experience like?</h4>
<p>Score: 4185</p>
<p>"Pizza?  I didn't think there'd be pizza in heaven," Jim said.</p>
<p>"Why not?  Pizza is the shit," the angel said.</p>
<p>"And cursing.  And beer?  Is that beer?"</p>
<p>In fact, the table was laid out with all the things Jim loved.  Chicken wings, malt whiskey, chilly fries, club sandwiches, those little wieners wrapped in bacon.  Over the table hung a cage where two beautiful women danced naked to 90's alternative.  The angel saw him gazing.</p>
<p>"You can have them after dinner," he said.  </p>
<p>"Are they being punished?" Jim asked.  He was a man, through and through, but he didn't like the idea of raping someone in paradise.</p>
<p>"Punished?  Is that what you think we do here?  They love it.  Some women like to party.  We don't hold that against them.  Cherry there has been welcoming our new guests for two hundred years."  The angel leaned close with a knowing smile.  "There are no anal fissures in heaven, so go wild."</p>
<p>Jim coughed.  "So uh, well . . ."  He coughed again.  "What are the uh, ground rules?"</p>
<p>"Ground rules?"</p>
<p>"Like, what's the forbidden fruit?  What's the catch around here?"</p>
<p>"No catches.  The boss doesn't care for rules.  Everybody gets in, and everybody gets what they desire.  Let's say you were a Christian all your life, well I'd be all shiny and I'd take you on the holy tour, you'd get to look down at hell and pity the damned, that sort of thing.  If you're Jim from Tennessee, you get chicken wings and bitches."</p>
<p>"Huh," Jim said.  "You know, I never really believed in this place, but I figured, if it was there, it'd be a little more uptight."</p>
<p>"Not since Lucy reclaimed the throne."</p>
<p>"Lucy?"</p>
<p>"Lucifer.  He's Lucy now.  Or she's Lucy now.  We're all a little confused.  But hey, more power to him if that's what gets her off."</p>
<p>"Lucifer?!  Lucifer is in charge of heaven?"</p>
<p>Jim knocked over his beer in surprise.  The angel was laughing heartily.  </p>
<p>"Oh, the shock on your faces, it never gets old!  Yes, Lucifer fought a last resistance a very long time ago.  He crushed the Usurper handily.  As the Usurper fell, he passed through earth, and it was in retaliation that he saddled you guys with all those ridiculous books and laws."</p>

<h4>[WP] Two god-like beings, disguised as old men, play a game of chess on a park bench to decide the final fate of humanity. The players, however, are distracted by a couple seated across them...</h4>
<p>Score: 4124</p>
<p>"Table stakes again?" the thin man asked. He wore black, and the lines time had etched into his face were harsh.</p>
<p>"Not this time, I think," the shorter man said. He wore white, a business suit so pristine that it almost hurt to look at. The thin man cocked an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"The last game, then?" he asked. The man in white considered for a moment, then nodded. Without another word, the two set up the chessboard which lie between them. It was concrete, and set into the table they shared, so grimy that even despite the bright midsummer light of a New York day, the city's grime had rendered both the white and black spaces a nigh-indistinguishable grey. Still, the two set their pieces, each drawing polished marble figures from a case of his own possession. The man in white played black, and the man in black played white. White king's knight to f3.</p>
<p>"Conservative," the man in white said.</p>
<p>"This is the game that matters," the man in black said. Black pawn to d5. Behind the white man, a couple sashayed by--two men, holding hands. The younger of the two was also shorter, Puerto Rican, and wore a fishnet tank top. His jeans could've been sprayed on. The man in black blinked. It would be hard to imagine a more stereotypically flamboyant fellow. The Puerto Rican man led his partner, an older black man with a salt-and-pepper beard and a charcoal business suit, to the table next to the two playing chess. The two kissed, the young fellow sitting on a concrete table identical to theirs.</p>
<p>"Interesting company," the man in black said. White pawn to c4. The man in white looked over slowly, rheumy eyes thoughtful.</p>
<p>"Réti Opening," he said, slowly returning his gaze to the board. The man in black shrugged. Black pawn to e6. "It's surprising, in a way, to be playing this game, finally."</p>
<p>"All the world, hanging on a game of chess," the thin man said, and there was a note of satisfaction in his voice, of savor.  "All that ever was, all that is, and all that ever might be, decided by the movements of clicking marble and alabaster.  One of us rises, and the other done away with forever.  An eternity surrendered and true omnipotence gained."  Yes, real enjoyment now.  Anticipation.  Hunger.  White pawn to g3.</p>
<p>"Wait, what?" the black man broke away from his amorous partner.  He looked at the two old men, one in white and one in black, but he didn't break his lover's embrace.</p>
<p>"Nothing you need to fret over," the man in white said.  Black King's knight to f6.  He waved a hand, half-distracted, and the black man started to turn back to the loving arms of his partner, but he hesitated.</p>
<p>"No...  There was something you said..." he muttered, forehead creased in intense concentration, almost as if he'd just forgotten something truly important.</p>
<p>"We're playing Neo-Catalan today," the man in black said, and smiled.  "It favors white, you know."  White pawn to d4.  The man in white shrugged.</p>
<p>"You two are playing for something important," the black man said, and broke away from his partner.</p>
<p>"David," the Puerto Rican man whined, but he followed his partner's gaze.</p>
<p>"I said--" the man in white said, again raising his hand.</p>
<p>"Let them be.  It won't matter if I win, and you can erase their memories if you win," the tall man interrupted, and smiled.  He turned to the two.  "I am playing this man for the fate of all the world."  The Puerto Rican man laughed out loud, but the black man, David, remained stone-faced.</p>
<p>"You're the devil," he said, and when he said it there was a moment of perfect quiet, the thunder of the city and the park stilling for just that one instant.  The tall man smiled, but said nothing.  Black pawn to a6.  David turned a bit.  "And you're God."</p>
<p>"Not as you imagine," the man in white said, glancing up.  "Though I prefer Yahweh.  The old names are nice."</p>
<p>"David, they're having fun with you," the Puerto Rican man said, taking his partner's hand.  David didn't move.  White Queen's bishop to f4.</p>
<p>"You're off your game today," the tall man said.  "Not good."  Yahweh shrugged ever-so-slightly.  Black queen to e7.</p>
<p>"Can't you beat him?" David asked, alarm growing in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Probably," Yahweh said.  "But those aren't the rules we play by."  The man in black snorted in derision.</p>
<p>"Remarkable," he said.  "You heap abuse on them, and they still grovel for you."  David glanced over, and Yahweh cocked his head to the side.</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"Such hate for men who lie with men.  Stone them.  Burn them.  Hang them," the tall man said, sneering.</p>
<p>"It's not that simple, Lucifer.  It never is," Yahweh said.  Lucifer shook his head.  White pawn to a3.  Lucifer turned to David.</p>
<p>"Are you a man of God?" he asked.  David drew in a breath of surprise, and glanced at Yahweh.</p>
<p>"I like to think so," he said, cautious.</p>
<p>"And you are a man who lies with men.  A gay man."  It was a statement.  David nodded.  Lucifer gestured across the table at Yahweh.  "His books say you should die.  Horribly.  How can you be both?"</p>
<p>"I..." David faltered.  "I don't know.  I just am."</p>
<p>"You call that free will?" Lucifer asked.</p>
<p>"I do," Yahweh said.  Lucifer shook his head.  Yahweh turned to David.</p>
<p>"Are you happy?" he asked. David blinked.</p>
<p>"I... I don't know," he said, and both Lucifer and Yahweh paused.  "I'm kind of scared right now, to be honest."</p>
<p>"Aside from that," Yahweh said.  "Your life.  Is it good?"  David considered.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," he said.  "Not all the time.  It's complicated."</p>
<p>"You see?" Yahweh asked.  Lucifer shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>"This claptrap again," Black pawn to h5, an obvious error.  White pawn to b4, swiftly, securing the center.</p>
<p>"Why is it complicated?" Yahweh asked, seemingly unperturbed at the state of the board.</p>
<p>"Well, I love two people.  Alex," David said, and squeezed his partner's hand, "and my wife, Marissa."  Lucifer laughed.</p>
<p>"Adultery as well!" he said.  Yahweh didn't speak.</p>
<p>"They both make me happy," David continued, gaining steam.  "And I- I can't be with either one alone."  He bowed his head.  "I wish I could be honest with her, though."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Yahweh said, a small smile warming their corner of the park.  "You would do it differently?" he asked, turning back to the board.  Black king's rook to H6.</p>
<p>"Of course I would," Lucifer said.  "That's the whole point, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"How?" Yahweh asked, and Lucifer froze.</p>
<p>"You've never asked me that before," he said after a long moment.</p>
<p>"I'm asking you now."  Lucifer thought.</p>
<p>"No love would be wrong," he said, and looked at David.  "They're not hurting anyone.  Why should they be punished?"</p>
<p>"What about Marissa?" Yahweh asked.  Lucifer didn't say anything.  After a time, Yahweh asked, "What else?"</p>
<p>"Freedom," Lucifer said, and the word was a whisper.  "Real freedom.  No commandments from on high, no walls of faith or law, nor condemnation of the righteous as punishment.  Men and women could do as they pleased."  Yahweh looked surprised.</p>
<p>"You don't think they have that?"</p>
<p>"They never have," Lucifer said, and shook his head very slowly.  "You created the most magnificent of all things, beings who could truly decide their own fate with only the dictates of existence itself to restrain them.  No spiritual obligations, and yet minds as keen as the greatest of the Seraphim.  Mankind was perfect in every way, and the first thing," Lucifer broke off and chucked for a moment.  "The very first thing you do is wall them in."  He laughed again, loudly and long.  David threw an arm around Alex, and drew the smaller man close.</p>
<p>"No," he said, with a sigh of savor.  "I would see what they can really do.  Whether they could surpass even you in the fullness of time.  I would see what comes from real freedom."  White queen to a4.  "Check."  Yahweh leaned back and regarded Lucifer.</p>
<p>"Is it really that simple for you?" he asked, after a time.  Lucifer nodded.  "Well, then, I suppose that I've been playing defensively for long enough today."</p>
<p>And, slowly, Yahweh tipped his own king over.  David gasped, and Lucifer's face screwed into a mask of confusion.</p>
<p>"I don't claim that the rules I chose were right," Yahweh said, his fingertips fading.  "Only that they were the rules I chose.  I hoped to help my children grow a little taller by their existence."</p>
<p>"You didn't need to do that," Lucifer muttered, eyes still fixed on the fallen black marble king.</p>
<p>"Of course I did," Yahweh said, and Lucifer finally met his gaze.  "They weren't the only ones I gave free will to."  His rheumy eyes twinkled for a moment, and then began to fade.  "Your rebellion was my greatest triumph.  I could barely believe it when you rose up."  Lucifer's breath turned ragged.</p>
<p>"They're yours now, in a way."  There was a silence, as the last traces of Yahweh faded away.  Then, like a scarcely-heard voice on the breeze, he added, "Not so simple, is it?"</p>
<p>Nobody said anything, for a while.</p>
<p>"What happens now?" David asked, meeting Lucifer's gaze.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he said eventually.  "It's complicated."</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the comments, folks, and thanks to /u/read_know_do for pointing out where my inexperience at real chess messed up the game.  Hopefully, it's fixed now.</p>

<p>"No Mr. Brock. I'm sorry Jason, but if you cannot commit to your schedule, you don't have what it takes

<p>I lower my head. I feel my eyes water.</p>
<p>I mean, it's one thing to yell at me because I left five minutes early yesterday -- after being the only one doing 
unpaid extra hours until midnight for the fifth week in row now.</p>
<p>But to fire me because of it? And in front of everybody?</p>
<p>I feel like that's kind of mean of Mr. Brock's part.</p>
<p>People are looking. I hate this.</p>
<p>"Are you going to cry, Jason? Really? You are a grown man. Get yourself together."</p>
<p>Lisa from accounting passes by and stops to watch. Everyone in their cubicle has 
their heads raised to watch the scene, as well.</p>
<p>I hate being in the spotlight. I'm not good at confrontation.</p>
<p>"Mr. Brock, please. I can put in more hours, if you want. I can --"</p>
<p>"Sorry, Jason. I need a person who can commit. I need someone responsible."</p>
<p>Come on. You are right, man. Stand up for yourself. Say something.</p>
<p>Brock never did extra hours. Neither did Lisa, or Tobias.</p>
<p>You are always the last one in the office, and you are also the one paid less.</p>
<p>Say something. Everybody is watching. Say something. Say something.</p>
<p>I hate this. Stop crying.</p>
<p>"Mr. Brock, c-can we talk in your office? I really need this job. I can --"</p>
<p>Mr. Brock throws a cardboard box my way. "We have nothing more to talk about, Jason."</p>
<p>He turns around and steps away, heading for his big office with his big window and his big trophies.</p>
<p>Little by little, the heads start lowering back to their computers. I start putting my stuff in the little box, feeling 
five different kinds of shitty.</p>
<p>I'm done in like five minutes. It's pretty easy, what with no pictures of family or kids. No pictures of the wife. No macaroni pen holder.</p>
<p>I don't have a lot of stuff to show for, in this life.</p>
<p>I put the last of my action figures (John Constantine, from Hellblazer) on the box and I get up, sniffing. </p>
<p>"Well... See you guys. I -- goodbye."</p>
<p>No one answers. People type away and drink their coffee away, distracted. I start walking.</p>
<p>I'm almost by the door when I hear it.</p>
<p>"MOTHERFUCKER!"</p>
<p>And a loud bang.</p>
<p>Like really really loud. </p>
<p>I stop and turn around, and everyone else does the same.</p>
<p>Black smoke is coming out from under Mr. Brock's door.</p>
<p>Little by little, slow motion step by slow motion step, I approach, because no one else seems to be willing to move. There's silence on the other end of the door.</p>
<p>Before I can reach the knob the door opens on its own, and everyone goes "Oh!" (except for Mr. Trigger from HR, who just says 'oh fuck this shit', gets up and leaves. We never saw him again.)</p>
<p>These reactions were prompted by the fact that, on the other side of the door, Mr. Brock was now seven different, completely separate objects, spread around his office.</p>
<p>His head and torso is lying on top of his desk, in the middle of a pool of blood.</p>
<p>His legs are on opposite sides of the room. So are his arms.</p>
<p>His penis and left ball are dangling from the roof fan, casually.</p>
<p>His right ball is on the floor by the door, right next to a squirrel holding a bazooka.</p>
<p>I'm gonna repeat that:</p>
<p>His right ball is on the floor by the door, right next to a squirrel holding a bazooka.</p>
<p>Lisa from accounting faints.</p>
<p>"Took care of this piece of flying, stinky shit, master", the squirrel says, smiling at me. His voice is high pitched and scratchy, like the voice of an old lady on 3 packs of Camels a day for the past 70 years.</p>
<p>I look at the squirrel for seventeen seconds, in complete silence.</p>
<p>Jenny from marketing faints, too.</p>
<p>Jack from HR whispers "holy shit", and has a heart attack. </p>
<p>(He died  a week later, I heard.)</p>
<p>"What?" I ask, suddenly realizing I hadn't blinked in a very long time.</p>
<p>I blink.</p>
<p>"The Abomination, they call me", the squirrel says, with a smirk. "Paid assassin. You saved my life on January 13th, 
down Berry Road, remember? Squirrel law determines I am now at your service. I took the liberty of doing a background check on your life. You got a lot of people being assholes to you and dragging you down. I'm here to take care of that for you."</p>
<p>"I-- Mr. Brock was not disturbing me. I -- he was an asshole, sure, but I didn't -- I mean..."</p>
<p>I take a deep breath. What little people on the office that have not yet fainted or had heart attacks (or walked away 
saying 'fuck this shit') are frozen watching the scene in a catatonic state.</p>
<p>The squirrel grabs Mr. Brock's right ball, throwing it over his left shoulder like a sports bag. "Now come on, let's get even with the world. Like I said, a lot of people have been fucking you over, Jason. It's time to grow up and be a man. Time to set the record straight."</p>
<p>"I.... Wh-what do you mean?"</p>
<p>The squirrel grabs me by the hand. He drags me towards the door.</p>
<p>People are watching still, frozen.</p>
<p>"Do you know a Ed Williams, Jason?" the squirrel asks, almost by the door.</p>
<p>"Yeah, he's my neighbor", I say, worrying about what's coming next.</p>
<p>"Could you grab the doorknob, please?" The Abomination looks up at the doorknob, out of his reach.</p>
<p>I turn it and open the door.</p>
<p>People are still frozen, staring at me.</p>
<p>Mike from research and development faints. Then he wakes up.</p>
<p>Then he faints again.</p>
<p>"What about Ed Williams?" I ask, as the squirrel drags me out into the hallway.</p>
<p>"He's stealing your TV Guides", The Abomination, says, shutting the door behind us with his feet. "Let's go shove a cactus up his ass."</p>
<p>And he drags me to the elevator.</p>

<h4>[EU] Tell the tale of Vault 69, which had 999 women and one man. Alternatively, tell the tale of Vault 68, which had 999 men and one woman.</h4>
<p>Score: 4004</p>
<p>There are six hundred and twelve rooms in the world. It might seem like a lot, but that's six hundred and twelve rooms for a thousand people, especially when there are eighty kitchens, forty bathing facilities, and one room which opens up only once a day with supplies.</p>
<p>The last room? That one's mine. It's the biggest room, and is the only one with a lockable door.</p>
<p>We all woke up here with no memories of any prior world. We remembered our names, how to read and write, stuff like that. But other than that? Nothing. My name is Gerald Howzer. That took me a while to remember. I also remembered that I shouldn't be naked. I walked around, and saw women scrambling around. There was some panic, some arguing, and others just efficiently looking around. They were naked too.</p>
<p>The women were aged twelve to fifty five. All colors, shapes, and sizes. Within a week, I had a lover. She was named Marcella, a beautiful woman with an accent I felt I should be able to place. Within a month, we lived in my room, at the time on the ground floor out of the ten. It had great lighting, and a comfortable bed. A week later, Marcella was dead. Fell off the tenth floor railing.</p>
<p>Everyone knew she was pushed. That's when the government started. Rationing out food fairly helped. Nightly patrols, to keep the peace. A legal system, with the lockable room used as a prison. I was a judge. Judge Howzer. Somehow it felt natural.</p>
<p>Of course, there were some troubles. Yes, I took lovers, keeping it casual. After a few months, one of the women was pregnant. It really didn't take a genius to figure who was the father. I was actually proud. Jamie, gorgeous little thing. At seventeen, and with all the enthusiasm in the world. She was beaten to death within a day once the rumor got out.</p>
<p>This time the killer was caught. The trial was pandemonium. She said that it's unfair. She wanted to be a mother too, but I turned her down. Why should all the pretty ones get a chance to be mothers, while the rest were to not be allowed even that? She was locked away for being a murderer. Everyone hated her.</p>
<p>But her words took root.</p>
<p>It took a year, but the revolution happened. The current regime solved all the issues. I now live in a lockable room. They lock it from the outside. Every day I get two to five visits. Until the woman is satisfied, I don't get water or food. I tried to resist, but they punished me. I don't want to talk about that.</p>
<p>I've been having sex with everything. I felt unclean the first time a twelve year old girl came. By the time the woman in her fifties came, I didn't even bat an eye. My body was used to working on demand. I remember Marcella a lot lately. We'd talk. I made her laugh. She made me smile. In a perfect world, we'd still be in our room, maybe raising a child. I've never met a child of mine.</p>
<p>I've been in this room for ten years now. A few of the women talk to me. Most don't, or address me as "you" and then dole out commands. From what I understand, it's fairly peaceful. We're six hundred and ninety strong. Eighty three of those are my children. The boys have all vanished. The insanity that followed that caused a lot of deaths.</p>
<p>Someone should be coming soon, and I must put back this journal back into it's hiding place. For what it's worth, I'm sorry Marcella. I'm sorry Jamie. To all my daughters, know that my biggest fear is the day when you walk through that door. I love you all.</p>

<h4>[WP] A man dies and goes to Heaven, only to find that every day there is a mandatory viewing of everyone in hell, where he sees his mom and wife burning</h4>
<p>Score: 3960</p>
<p>Everybody loves Hitler.</p>
<p>It's 8 o'clock sharp, not that time matters in the eternal kingdom of heaven, and the Impale Adolf Hitler Interactive Exhibit opens up right on schedule. The angels have been waiting. Popcorn in one hand and pitchforks in the other, the moment the exhibit opens, all the good people of heaven go wild stabbing the ever-loving <em>shit</em> out of a scared defenceless German.</p>
<p>Tyler doesn't care for that. Not today. Today, he's finally worked up the courage to see the two exhibits he's avoided all his afterlife. One, his biological mother. This will be the first time Tyler meets her. Two, his widowed wife. This will be the last time Tyler can bear to see her.</p>
<p>The Tour Guide took time out of His almighty schedule to personally show them to Tyler.</p>
<p>"Are you ready, my child?"</p>
<p>"No." Tyler adjusts his halo. "Let's do it." </p>
<p>Starting from the ticket booth, they walk slowly through the Museum Of Eternal Damnation (Formerly Known As Hell). They stroll past Jeffrey Dahmer, being skinned alive by angels. They go around Ted Kaczynski, being strung up by fishing hooks. They make a right on Pol Pot, being boiled alive in his Pol Pot.</p>
<p>Tyler needs to ask. "Why are they here."</p>
<p>"Well, my son, amongst acts of cannibalism and necrophil--"</p>
<p>"No, uh... I mean Casey and my mother. The biological mom, that is."</p>
<p>"Ah." The Guide pauses. "Tell me about your wife, Casey."</p>
<p>"You're the omniscient one, you tell me."</p>
<p>"Humour an old man."</p>
<hr />
<p>"Sigh. She saved my life. My pathetic, miserable excuse for a life. Well... apparently you judged otherwise, but she was <em>my</em> angel, you-dammit.</p>
<p>We met on my 21st birthday. I was partying and drinking with my college frat friends, instead of studying for the finals. Suddenly, Casey. She crashed the party, and I mean <em>crashed</em>. She looked like she was, what, late-twenties? I later found out she was actually 33. At first we all thought she was a professor or something -- she's certainly got the smarts -- but around the moment we were making out half-naked on the beer-stained couch, I figured differently.</p>
<p>Jerry teased me for <em>months</em> about being a cougar's cub. He was my best man.</p>
<p>Casey turned my life around. She is... well, was... the founder of some really big biotech startup. She got me a summer internship, my first real job, doing community management for the company. Basically, tweeting. But she made sure I got opportunities to learn and do more skilled jobs, and I moved up and up until I became the Chief Marketing Officer!</p>
<p>Then some asshole hit me with a truck. And here we are."</p>
<p>The Guide was silent for a while.</p>
<p>"Thank you, my child. Would you like to know how she died?"</p>
<p>"Wow. You gotta rub it in like that?"</p>
<p>"Would you?"</p>
<p>"...yes. Tell me."</p>
<p>"Suicide."</p>
<p>"Fuck. Fuck you, <em>fuck</em> you. Is that why she's here? Because we loved each other so much she couldn't wait to see me again?"</p>
<p>"Well... yes and no."</p>
<p>"<em>WHY CAN'T YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS NORMALLY.</em>"</p>
<p>The angels outside the Stuff Albert Fish Into A Meat Grinder Interactive Exhibit were getting concerned about the angry angel behind them arguing with the big guy. They pretended not to notice, and casually continued turning the crank on a half-ground-up Fish. </p>
<hr />
<p>Tyler and the Guide silently moved on.</p>
<p>They were now in the far back of the Museum, the wing of the lesser evils, or rather, the less famous evils. Almost no-one visits this section. Hence, rather than being granted individual exhibits, the captives here get filed away in glass boxes, clearly labelled with their primary sin. To Tyler's left, "These Peeps Killed Someone To Death". To his right, "These Peeps Assaulted Someone With Their Dick".</p>
<p>It's a long walk.</p>
<p>"My son, how are you feeling?"</p>
<p>"Oh that reminds me. How's my son?"</p>
<p>"Your best friend and best man, Jerry, adopted him. He's giving your son the best medical care they can afford. He might even grow up to have a healthy, normal life."</p>
<p>"Jerry's a good guy."</p>
<p>"I'll remember that in forty years' time."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"So... what about my mother?"</p>
<p>"What about your mother?"</p>
<p>"We've talked so much about Casey. Aren't we going to talk about my biological mother? I mean, I've never met her, so I can't tell you anything about her."</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"Okay, fine. I know she dumped me at a hospital. I know she left a note saying 'I'll find you someday'. I know she never did. Look, dude. I think I deserve to know more about my biological mother. Can't we talk about her?"</p>
<p>"We already have."</p>
<p>"Sheesh. See, that's the kind of cryptic answer nonsense I'm talking about. I know you like to 'work in mysterious ways', but it puts people off. Seriously. Have you noticed you've had a lower percentage of active members across all Abrahamic religions recently? I think after a couple millennia, it's high time you reboot your brand. Build a new identity. I could help! We need to make your brand cleaner, more cool, more hip. Remember that thing you did with the Top 10 List? On the stone tablets? That was <em>genius</em>. Way ahead of its time. Maybe if we did more of that again, this time on modern-day tablets, we'd--"</p>
<p>"We're here."</p>
<hr />
<p>Tyler spins his head around to where the Guide is pointing. He doesn't look at the box's label. He doesn't spare a glance at the thousands of starving people covered in piss and shit and blood. He only sees her.</p>
<p>"Casey."</p>
<p>He looks into her pale blue eyes, partially obscured by unkempt blonde hair. She's still beautiful. Covered in her own faeces, but still beautiful, at least to Tyler. He looks <em>directly</em> in her eyes, but...</p>
<p>"She doesn't recognize me."</p>
<p>Casey blinks. She scratches the rope burn on her neck. She blinks again, and turns away to look at an inmate trying to lick their own elbow.</p>
<p>"She doesn't recognize me."</p>
<p>"My child, I am so sorry."</p>
<p>"Why doesn't she--"</p>
<p>"Sometimes, people lose their minds before they're lucky enough to lose their life."</p>
<p>"What?! You can't, like, restore their minds or something?"</p>
<p>"I can. Would you like me to do that now?"</p>
<p>Tyler looks back at the glass box. That broken woman, wearing the skin of his former beloved, is not his former beloved. The mouth they once shared passionate kisses with, is now idiotically attempting to lick an elbow.</p>
<p>"...no."</p>
<p>"Then I shall not."</p>
<p>"I'm done. I can't do this. I don't want to see my biological mother anymore, either."</p>
<p>"My child..."</p>
<p>"What. What now."</p>
<p>"...you've already seen her."</p>
<p>"Oh. Did we walk past her on the way here? You didn't say anyth--"</p>
<p>At that moment, all the pieces fall in place, as Tyler's mind falls to pieces. It's not true. He's never seen his biological mom. It's not true. She promised to come back for him. It is not true. Casey went directly towards him at that college party. It's a lie. Casey turned his life around, she took care of him, she raised him. It can't be true. Tyler and Casey's son came out deformed and sick. No, no no no please God it cannot cannot CANNOT BE--</p>
<p>Casey successfully touches her elbow with her tongue. She lets out a victory squeal.</p>
<p>Tyler hears her, and looks up. This time, he sees the label on the glass box.</p>

<h4>[WP] A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rouge planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".</h4>
<p>Score: 3894</p>
<p>The house was filled with tears of sadness, joy and laughter. Long hugs, intense and heartfelt kisses, jokes to cheer up the inevitability of a saddened mood. Chris sat on the couch, surrounded by his friends and his family, and he couldn't but smile. The melancholy of the situation weighed on him, and yet there was this feeling that he couldn't shake off. ''If we have to go, then this is a pretty decent way of going.''</p>
<p>The crash of the two planets had been predicted to happen at 5:55AM EST, 25th October 2015. The planet had come in NASA's sights roughly a month ago, and from that moment on everything changed.</p>
<p>There was of course an uproar. People panicked, immediately thinking the world was about to end. It was 2012 all over again, with mass conspirators claiming they had seen it coming and that the USA, the UN or the lizard people were the cause of it. The closer we got to 31th since that moment, the more the average people started to dread. The governments kept people updated, but after a while the impending doom was wide-spread. ''If they would've been able to do something about, they would've, by now'' was the train of thought most people had. And when the rocket launches NASA did failed and didn't alter the planet's course for five times, people lost hope.</p>
<p>Since that moment some people died, thinking it was better to take fate into own hands. Others got careless with drugs and died by overdose. The others just kept going. Irrelevant jobs were abandoned, but luckily a large amount of people volunteered to keep doing the important jobs like rail roads and food supply for that last month.</p>
<p>All the people who were still with us on this 24th day of October had accepted whatever was coming from them. Chris had too. What other choice did he have? It was not like he could do anything about it. He didn't have the knowledge, nor the time.</p>
<p>Chris drifted off, knowing he would be woken if anything important was to happen. He woke up, hours later, in a dead silent room. His heart jumped, his sight still foggy from his deep slumber. Did he miss it? Was it over already? Of course not. Why would I be alive then? Wait? What if we survived? He rubbed in his eyes to regain vision. He looked around.</p>
<p>Nothing moved. Absolutely nothing happened.</p>
<p>''Hello? People?''</p>
<p>No reaction. Not a sound, not a movement, not a blink of an eye. </p>
<p>And then a sharp pain in his forearm. He looked down and saw a smear of blood. ''What the hell?'' Chris shouted while he shot up from the couch. Holding his breath he walked to the sink confused and cleared up the blood with a splash of water. As he dried it with a paper towel, he could read an etching engraved into his arm. It already had the faded pink color of a scar gotten long ago, and it read:</p>
<p>''No matter how long it takes, save us.''</p>
<p>Chris exhaled.</p>

<h4>[WP] In a world where puns are illegal, one man rises up in opposition.</h4>
<p>Score: 3810</p>
<p>“Sir, I was looking for you,” Howard said, staring at the back of the chief’s neck. “We got him.” He turned around slowly, eyes staring down at a manila folder in his hands. He was an intimidating man, even despite his enlarged belly and the countless wrinkles spiraling down his face, neck, and everywhere else. Tall, maybe 6’2’’, and still quite muscular—especially for a 63-year-old that refused to retire. He was bald now, but he’d had thick, black hair when Howard had first joined the department over a decade ago. Even after all that time, he still felt as if he were a child talking to an adult whenever he was around the chief.</p>
<p>“Him? Who is him?” Chief said, not looking up from the manila folder.</p>
<p>“Him,” Howard said, nodding toward the folder. “We got him.”</p>
<p>“Him? Al? You got Al?” Chief said, glancing up from the folder in his hand, then slowly closing the cover. A large, red “CONFIDENTIAL” was stamped across its front.</p>
<p>“We did, he was outside of an arboretum. We caught him red handed. No, red lipped. Red worded? We caught him in the act is what I’m trying to say.”</p>
<p>“The fuck is an arboretum?”</p>
<p>“Sir, it’s a garden with a large collection of trees instead of flowers. Kind of like a forest, except man made,” Howard said. “It’s basically a forest.”</p>
<p>“Where is there an arboretum in New York?”</p>
<p>“Central Park. Does it matter? We got him.”</p>
<p>“Where is he?” Chief said, glancing around the room. The veins on his neck, visible through his wrinkled, dried skin, popped out slightly as he swiveled his head.</p>
<p>“He’s in the interrogation room.” Howard nodded toward the big, metal door on his left. </p>
<p>“How do you know you got the right guy?” Chief asked.</p>
<p>“He was standing outside of the arboretum telling people they were barking up the wrong tree.” Howard paused. “You know, bark: like a tree has.” </p>
<p>“My god,” said Chief, lowering the folder down to the side of his left leg. </p>
<p>“That—that wasn’t all,” Howard said, stuttering slightly. “When I approached him, he told me to leaf him alone. Not leave, but leaf. To leaf him alone.”</p>
<p>Chief slowly walked to the wooden table in the corner of the room and lowered the manila folder onto the top of it. He placed both palms down and sighed. </p>
<p>“We got a real sicko on our hands, Howard. You did good getting him off the street. Has he confessed yet?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. We sent Chuck in earlier. He came out in tears, an absolute wreck. He didn't even get a chance to turn on the recorder. Said he wouldn’t stop punning, that Al told him to spruce up the place. Said that it would help us branch out creatively. Chuck tried to play it off, tried to be the tough guy, but Al just didn’t let up.” Howard turned his head toward the metal door to his left. “Chuck told me Al claimed he had an idea for an escape that he maple off. Maple, not may pull. He made it clear that it was a pun.” Howard exhaled deeply and stared up at the ceiling. “He said Al called all of us saps, and that he wooden be surprised if he just walked out the front door. Wooden. Like wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“Dear lord in heaven,” Chief said, lifting his palms off the table then smashing his fist down on top of the manila folder. “God damn this monster. I’m going to go in,” he said. </p>
<p>“Chief,” Howard pleaded, his voice higher than he had intended it.</p>
<p>“No, I have to do this. I can’t send any more of my men in. I need to be the one to face this maniac.”</p>
<p>Howard nodded and took a step back so that the door was clear. Chief slowly unbuttoned his sport coat, revealing a leather holster underneath. He unlatched it, the grip of his Glock now exposed, then re-fastened the top button on the jacket. </p>
<p>“Turn the recorder on by the window. If it gets too much, please leave the room. I will not hold it against you. Just make sure the recorder is running—we can’t let him go this time.”</p>
<p>Chief exhaled, brushing the side of his hand down the front of his jacket, then made his way toward the door, unlocking it and pulling it open before stepping inside. Howard walked around the wall to the one-way window, flipped on the old tape-deck recorder, and peered inside. </p>
<p>“Al?” Chief said, sliding a chair out from the metal table in the middle of the room. “I’m Dave Johnson, Chief of Police. Do you know why you’re in here?”</p>
<p>Al glanced up at the chief, but seemed to be looking toward the corner of the room.</p>
<p>“That,” Al said, pointing to a whiteboard in the back of the room, “over there.”</p>
<p>The chief turned around. “The whiteboard? What about it?”</p>
<p>“It’s remarkable.” </p>
<p>Howard involuntarily smashed his fist down on the table in front of the glass, but the chief seemed not to notice Al’s pun. </p>
<p>“Nothing remarkable about it.”</p>
<p>“The whiteboard,” Al repeated, “it’s remarkable. Re-markable.”</p>
<p>The chief squinted slightly, as if he were in pain. “Seems unremarkable to me. Now please answer the question. Do you know why you’re here?”</p>
<p>Al sighed. “Let me guess, is it because of the two pieces of string I ate?”</p>
<p>“What?” said the chief.</p>
<p>“The string, I ate two pieces of string. I shit you not.”</p>
<p>Chief’s face became visibly tense, a reddish hue slowly replacing his normal pale color. “You are here for your puns, Al. You’ve been on the pun,” Chief stopped, his eyes wide. “Run. You’ve been on the run for a long time, but we got you. And we have you recorded making these puns.”</p>
<p>Al stared down at the metal table and his eyes closed. “I know,” he said. </p>
<p>“So you admit it?”</p>
<p>“You think I like making puns? You think I like breaking the law?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t like it, then why do you do it?”</p>
<p>Al slowly lifted his head back up toward the chief. </p>
<p>“A long time ago, I was kidnapped and brutally tortured. My life was threatened and I was brought to the brink of death. Do you know what that’s like? Six men accosted me, beat me and chained me to a tree as I walked home. They said they’d tell me ten puns to dictate my future. If I survived, then I was free to go. They told me no one had ever lived through them, they assured me I would die. They laughed when they said that, stared straight in my eyes and pulled the chain tighter to keep me from squirming. Then they began. Each pun was said with hate, each one was meant to kill me. Yet in the end, no pun in ten did.”</p>
<p>The chief’s eyes rolled back in his head, his torso slumping forward onto the table in front of him. He began convulsing, seizing hard enough to knock the chair out from under him, his body plummeting to the floor behind the desk. Howard tried to reach for the alarm on the far right of the window, to hit the button and call for help, yet his limbs refused move. His mind refused to listen. The room turned black.</p>
<p>Howard awoke to a uniformed man standing over him, one of the new recruits he’d not yet learned the name of. He was towering over Howard, yelling for him to get up.</p>
<p>“Gone!” shouted the recruit.</p>
<p>“Huh,” Howard said, voice groggy and slow. </p>
<p>“He’s gone. He took the tapes and he’s gone.”</p>
<p>“Ch-chief,” Howard said, pulling himself up. His arms felt weak, as if he’d spent the past few hours lifting weights. “Where’s the chief.”</p>
<p>“He’s okay, we’ve got him in the office. He’s awake. You’re both going to be fine.”</p>
<p>“Al,” Howard said, remembering the barrage of puns. “Where did he go?” </p>
<p>“He’s gone,” said the recruit.</p>
<p>“Where did he go?” Howard repeated, now shouting.</p>
<p>“Gone, sir. He walked right out the front door.” The recruit paused, but Howard could tell he wasn’t yet done speaking. “We also have reason to believe the name we’ve been calling him is fake.”</p>
<p>“What? Why? We had him here, he responded to Al. All the background checks matched his name.”</p>
<p>“It’s just, his name. Mr. O’Bye. Al O’Bye.”</p>
<p>A stinging pain shot through Howard’s skull. Alibi. Why hadn’t he seen it before; that was why his history was so clean, why he had been so elusive. They were tracking a ghost.</p>
<p>“Fuck me,” Howard muttered, holding his left hand to his throbbing temple. He stared into the empty interrogation room.</p>
<p>“Sir, that’s not all,” said the recruit. He picked up a folded piece of paper from table and handed it to Howard. “He—well—he left you a note.”</p>
<p>Howard stared at the paper. “Detective,” it read in cursive on the front, hand written in blue ink. He flipped it open. </p>
<p>“You ask me why I do what I do, what makes me who I am. Yet you don’t even know who it is that I am. Perhaps I’m simply an unappreciated baker getting revenge on the world after suffering through long hours because I kneaded the dough. Maybe I’m a forlorn banker, doing this because I’ve finally lost interest. Or maybe I’m just a backwards poet, writing inverse and making no sense. Yet, in the end, you're not much different than I. You stay up all night and day, searching for me, wondering who I am, waiting for the light that never comes. Only when I stayed out too late waiting for that sun to rise, it dawned on me.</p>
<p>It’s been my pleasure meeting you, perhaps I will see you around.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mae B. Layter”</p>
<p>Howard lowered the note, a warm sensation running down his face as if an insect were crawling on the flesh above his lip. He placed his left hand beneath his nose, rubbed it, and then glanced down at his fingers. They were covered in blood. Darkness again drowned out his vision.</p>

<h4>[WP] An elderly couple takes to petty crime to see their superhero kids who no longer call.</h4>
<p>Score: 3700</p>
<p>James was the average man of his age; he grew up in a poor family with five siblings, got conscripted into Vietnam where he made friends and lost some too, then came home to a family of his own. Unlike his parents, though, he decided to have just one child- he saw both how much his parents struggled and how little affection they showed with such massive time constraints. Supporting that many children is no simple task, and comes with sacrifice. The six of them returned the favor later in life, visiting and helping take care of their parents until old age took them from this world.</p>
<p>Now, James is seventy-two; wisps of grey hairs poke out of his head like fading memories. His life is dull, his back and hips are worn out to the point he can't garden for long or fire a rifle properly anymore. Old age takes a lot of what you once loved from you, including the people around you. Three siblings lost, and a wife that passed too soon...</p>
<p>But his son is enough to make it all worth it. The light of his life; the sum of his existence. The culmination of years spent nurturing, like a sapling sprouting into a thick, strong Oak tree.</p>
<hr />
<p>James lazily flipped through channels on the TV, earning grumpy shouts of refute from the other elderly people sitting in the rec room with him. </p>
<p>"Keep the damn channel still, you're going to give me vertigo."</p>
<p>He shushed her. "Quiet, Doris. My son might be on TV again and I need to find him."</p>
<p>Channel 5 was the jackpot.</p>
<p>"<em>Breaking news, brought to you live: during an armed heist of the local Bank of America, one man took down five burglars single-handed. It's unlike anything we've ever seen before- no hostages were harmed, and the money has been returned safely. We'll keep you updated as time goes by.</em>"</p>
<p>The helicopter camera panned out over a crowd of bystanders cheering and police taking the robbers into custody. Just barely, as James scooted forward and squinted, he could see his son waving to the crowd.</p>
<p>"See, Doris! That's my Kevin! I told you he'd be on TV again!" The old man lit up like a Christmas tree on a dark, December night.</p>
<p>"That's not even impressive. Frank, I want to watch the cooking shows. Change it back already."</p>
<p>His smile faded, twisting into a frown. "What the fuck am I doing in this place? I'm not Frank. Here, Doris, watch your cooking shows."</p>
<p>He changed the channel, went back to his room and put proper clothes on. <em>How long has it been? A year, maybe more? Two years? I can't wait any longer. I need to see my baby boy again.</em></p>
<p>Rifling through his closet, there was a carton of old love letters from his late wife. He looked at them and smiled, but underneath them was a .22 pistol that no one had caught during his entry inspection. He slipped it under his belt and walked up to the front desk. "Melissa, I'm gonna go for a walk today."</p>
<p>She looked up from her cell phone and lazily waved a hand at him, buzzing the door open. He pretended to follow his usual path, hobbling on his cane, then deviated and slipped through an opening in the brush out back. He made his way to a gas station. </p>
<p>"Give me your money. Just a few dollars is fine," James shouted weakly, gun trembling in the air.</p>
<p>The cashier was calm for the situation. "Sir, put the gun down. Let me help you, okay? What do you need?"</p>
<p>James' voice began to crack. "Please, give me some money and call the police."</p>
<p>"Sir, j-"</p>
<p>"DO IT," he screamed, firing a shot to the right of him. Glass rained down with bits of cardboard and broken cigarettes. The man lifted his arms up and obliged, then handed him a hundred dollar bill.</p>
<p>James sat down outside the building and waited for about five minutes, staring at the clouds go by. Soon enough, his son arrived, like he always did.</p>
<p>"My son! I knew the city's superhero would make it here to save the day."</p>
<p>Kevin groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Dad, I'm not a superhero. I always tell you, I'm just a cop who does his job well. Come on, why'd you go and do something this drastic? Where'd you get the gun? Someone could've really been hurt, Dad."</p>
<p>James looked down, answering meekly. "I wanted to see you again. It's been several years now, you're always so busy."</p>
<p>Kevin took a deep breath as his father began to cry. "Come on, let's take you back to Glowing Meadows."</p>
<p>James lit up again, the hope of a younger man glinting in his eyes. "Can we play checkers?"</p>
<p>Kevin put an arm around his father, helping him into the car. "Yeah, we can play checkers. Just get in the car while I explain this to my supervisor, okay?"</p>
<p>"Sure thing, Kev, my man. I can't wait for you to tell me all about your job, and your love life. You need to get married and give me grandchildren!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, Dad. We'll talk all about it when we get back."</p>
<p>He shut the cruiser door and walked up to his superior officer. "Sorry, chief. My-"</p>
<p>"I heard the whole thing, son. You don't visit your father? I oughtta put <em>you</em> in jail. Respect is something the elderly earn."</p>
<p>Kevin' gaze shifted to the dirt, and he began to tremble a little. His voice was low and weak, barely audible. </p>
<p>"I just visited him three days ago, sir."</p>

<h4>[WP] an immortal man who cannot be physically injured is a passenger on a jet that's going to crash.</h4>
<p>Score: 3575</p>
<p>Jesse dug her fingernails into the armrests.  Only after a few seconds did she realize that on one side she was accidentally digging into the fingers of the man in the window seat.  She quickly moved her hand, and yelped out a 'Sorry'.  </p>
<p>The man turned to her and smiled, a calm gentle smile, a smile that did not fit with the violent turbulence rocking the plane.  "It's quite alright." His voice was so soft and serene.  It immediately calmed her down. </p>
<p>"I've just never been on a flight with turbulence like this before." She was imploring him for more comfort, she wanted him to tell her that everything was going to be fine.  If he told her that she would be fine, she would believe him.</p>
<p>But he looked around the plane and said, "Yes, this is far worse than any turbulence I've experienced either."  She felt her stomach tighten as he said that, she had been counting on comfort from this man more than she realized, and the matter-of-fact tone which he had said that had stripped it from her.</p>
<p>"I hope we'll all be alright," she said.  He had moved his hand from the armrest, so she quickly gripped it again, her knuckles were white from the strain.</p>
<p>"It does not seem likely," he said, still looking around the plane.  </p>
<p>"What?" the knot in her stomach was moving up to her throat.</p>
<p>"If you look around the plane you can see that we are definitely tilted at a downwards angle.  This means that the plane is likely losing altitude.  The only reason I could think for this to occur is some sort of engine failure, and given that we are currently travelling above the Himalayas, a safe emergency landing seems unlikely."</p>
<p>"What are you-" was all Jesse could manage before a loud explosion rocked the cabin.  She couldn't see where it came from, but the plane immediately started to plummet.  The oxygen mask came down and Jesse desperately fumbled with it to fix it to her face.  She finally attached it and looked at the man next to her. To her surprise he had not put on his mask, more so he did not look worried at all.  In fact, he looked her in the eyes, and smiled.  That same serene smile that was so out of place.  He slowly placed his hand on top of hers, the gentle pressure of his hand was so comforting. She locked eyes with him.  She needed him to tell her she wasn't going to die.  She needed him to tell her she was going to be alright.  "Please sir, I don't want to die here.  I want to go back home.  I want to see my parents again.  I want to see my boyfriend.  I want to see my cat.   I don't want to die.  Please, tell me I'll be fine."</p>
<p>He broke eye contact with her for just a second and frowned.  "You will be fine." He spoke the words and a wave of relief washed over her.  She let go of the arm rest and gripped his hand as hard as she could.  He still just held hers with the gentlest amount of pressure.  "Death is not the tragedy that the living fear it will be.  It is merely the next step on a very long journey."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>He looked out the window, the mountains were rapidly rising up to meet them.  He turned to her placing his other hand underneath hers, and held it firmly.  "I mean, you will never know how much I envy you."</p>
<p>"Wh-"</p>

<h4>[WP] Imaginary friends usually move on to a new child when their child stops believing in them. This imaginary friend, however, decides to stay behind because he has a feeling things are about to go very, very wrong for his child.</h4>
<p>Score: 3553</p>
<p>"Will we always be friends?" Sarah asked the darkness of her bedroom.</p>
<p>"Of course," Danny the Dino Man replied, "we will always be the best of friends."</p>
<p>"No matter what?"</p>
<p>"No matter what."</p>
<p>Sarah's mother, a world-renowned microbiologist had spent hours, only that very morning, discussing with Sarah why imaginary friends were not real. You see, imaginary friends were not rooted in science. At least, not the kind of science adults could see. </p>
<p>And on any other day, Danny the Dino Man would have moved on. That was the tradition, after all. When a child was old enough to understand the reasoning behind a parent's insistence that imaginary friends were not real, it was the duty of that imaginary friend to report back to the agency of Imaginary Matches for reassignment. </p>
<p>But Sarah was no ordinary child. And Danny the Dino Man was one of the best imaginary friends in the business. He was a seasoned veteran, and never once had he met a soul so loving as Sarah. She lit up when she played, and all the play revolved around being a doctor and helping anyone who needed some fixing. </p>
<p>Danny patted her head, and stroked her hair behind her ear as she fell asleep. He had always hoped in the best for her. She was going to be a brilliant doctor someday. And he knew it as time for him to go. He had done his duty, been there when her mother had not, and provided the inspiration her file had required. He had been the companion her young and growing soul needed. </p>
<p>But somehow, he could not manage to leave her. She was soundly asleep, and he sat down on the floor, ready to crawl his way under the bed back to his home land, but something held him there. </p>
<p>The door of her bedroom creaked open behind him. That would be Mom, coming home from the late shift, he knew. Only... the shadow was all wrong as the light fell across the floor from the hall. Danny turned, and there was a man. An adult man.</p>
<p>Imaginary friends were entirely invisible to adults. This man made him shiver. He looked normal, respectable even, in a button-up shirt and loosened tie. Perhaps he was a doctor friend of Sarah's mom. Danny's stomach clenched in knots. </p>
<p>The man walked to the bed, sat down on the edge, and stroked Sarah's hair. No, stroking was not the right word. It was not loving and protective, it was...molesting. Sarah woke up, and before she could even scream, the man's hand covered her mouth. He pulled the covers back and climbed on top of her. </p>
<p>Danny was powerless. Imaginary friends could not touch adults. If he could have... he would have shown him how ferocious a T-Rex could really be. But he could not. He could only hold Sarah's hand.</p>
<p>"I am right here with you," he told her, "and that's how it will always be."</p>
<p>Sarah cried, and sobbed, and never said a word. For hours after the man left, she cried onto Danny's scaly chest. For hours, Danny told her it would be alright, only to realize it was not. No part of what had happened was alright. </p>
<p>The next day, Sarah's mom asked her why she was upset. Danny held her hand at the breakfast table. She would not speak.</p>
<p>"Are you upset about Danny leaving?" she would ask, "did you have nightmares?"</p>
<p>But Sarah did not speak. And for years, Sarah was angry at Danny.</p>
<p>Children were funny that way, he knew. Memories were often fuzzy, and blame got shifted. And somehow, Danny became the boogeyman of nightmares. And Sarah's mother introduced her new boyfriend several weeks later. They married when Sarah was six.</p>
<p>But, Danny was a Dino Man of his word. He never returned for reassignment. He became invisible to Sarah as she grew, and he watched as she tore her own flesh open, deeper and deeper every night. He watched as she stared into the mirror with hate, pinching and poking her disgusting flesh with an anger unrivaled by anything Danny had ever seen. </p>
<p>He watched it all. He watched her grow, and he watched her lose interest in school, in achievement, and he watched her numbness outgrow her beauty. Danny watched Sarah fight with her mother. He watched them scream, and throw things, and he watched her mother give up. He watched the step-father every night. </p>
<p>And, in time, he watched Sarah give up on herself. Her step-father had taken so much from her. But worst of all, he had taken her self-esteem. He had trapped her in the belief that she deserved what had happened to her. And she had actively sought to ruin herself to make that belief a truth. </p>
<p>It broke Danny's heart to see the girl he loved, the brilliant doctor-to-be, become a surgeon of her own flesh. There are no kind of words for that aching agony. Where once, Danny would have slept next to her bed, and told her great stories of Dino battles, he watched her sob herself into the dark abyss of night, only to have the light awaken her and continue the death trap of life she was stuck in.</p>
<p>But eventually Sarah ran away, and Danny followed. Sarah was seventeen when she tried heroin for the first time. It was then that Danny realized the power of mind-altering drugs. Sarah, the adult, could now see Danny. </p>
<p>Surely, he thought, that this would be his moment. But, in reality, he had never felt so terrible in his whole life. </p>
<p>"YOU KNEW!" she screamed, terrible in her wrath, "YOU KNEW AND DID NOTHING!"</p>
<p>"I could not do anything." It was all he could manage.</p>
<p>"I HATE YOU!"</p>
<p>She screamed, and swore, and turned away, and ran, and vomited.</p>
<p>And he knew her anger was misplaced. He accepted it. In fact, if it could help her accept that what had happened was a terrible trial, he would be the face of her anger. He would do anything to help his favorite child, even if she was an adult now.</p>
<p>Everyday, as Sarah shot up, Danny would appear to her. Day by day, her anger grew less, and their conversations grew longer. A year after she left home, Danny had become a constant in her life once more. Not because she was always using, no, in fact, she had quit entirely. But she could see him because she believed. That belief was something adults lacked on their own. His Sarah, the amazing and imaginative, had not fallen short in adulthood.</p>
<p>They talked and talked, as only old friends could. Eventually, she got a respectable job as a waitress, and even went to school. After some urging from Danny, she even went to the police and sought out counseling.</p>
<p>Danny was a Dino Man of his word. When she sat in the court room, facing her step-father, she recounted the awful things that had happened. She recounted the way she had felt, and the things she had done. The things he had done. The things she had done, the lies she had told to keep his secret, and the way her mind had been manipulated. And Danny the Dino Man held her hand the whole time. </p>
<p>He traced the scars on her arms, and it was the proudest moment of his life. She cried, and she let it out. She had accepted the past. Danny the Dino Man had finally achieved what he had set out to do. Sarah had needed a friend long after childhood, and though the rules were against that, and life seemed to work against him, he achieved it through love. She thanked him, for having kept his promise thirteen years ago. </p>
<p>He returned on occasion to visit Sarah, though eventually she lost her ability to see him again. After nearly another decade and several successful assignments, Danny received one for a little girl named Ivy. </p>
<p>When Danny saw Ivy tell her mother about her imaginary friend, Danny the Dino Man... well, that was the proudest moment of his life, too. Sarah's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>"Danny might be the best friend you ever have. Keep him close, and tell him I love him."</p>

<h4>[WP] Write a seemingly innocent story that could have been written for children. Then tell a different perspective on the same story that casts it in a totally different light.</h4>
<p>Score: 3509</p>
<p>His home life left a lot to be wanted. Poverty in the sixties in England was no joke, especially in a mill town where alcoholism and beating the family was the norm, rather than the exception. Pre-Thatcher UK was a different place. Working class people did not get to hang around middle class or upper class ones. It was unheard of. And even though his father was worse than most, he still would have grown up fine if he wasn't different.</p>
<p>Crooked teeth due to malnutrition causing his jaw to be underdeveloped. His nose had been broken by his father so many times that it would never have a semblance of normalcy. His mother didn't do much. His father didn't like much of anything. Always hungry, resorting to hand-me-downs not only from his father because they were too scarce, but from his mother as well. He was bullied relentlessly. He learned to steal, lie, cheat and fight very well by then.</p>
<p>He was nine years old. Both his curse and his hope could be summed up in one word: <em>magic</em>. And  he had found someone he could share it with. Her name was Lily. They couldn't meet in public, because she was middle class, and the scandal would cause both their parents to force them apart. But that would be fine, because once they went to Hogwarts, they could be seen together in public. And that made everything seem better.</p>
<p>Severus Snape got sorted into Slytherin. He heard good things about it from his mother, when she spoke of a time when she wasn't so beaten down. Lily was in Gryffindor. His hope that they could be seen together in public vanished in that moment. His hope for acceptance from his peers got destroyed by the first night, when he was beaten for being a <em>mongrel</em>, a <em>half-breed</em>. His impure blood and his poverty made him a pariah in his own house.</p>
<p>Four Gryffindor students would hunt him down relentlessly. Still, his life on the street prepared him for it. Along with his talent to invent spells, he rarely came out wanting. But the staff were a problem. He was always blamed, because Horace Slughorn, his head of house, was surprisingly cold towards him. Many years later, he understood that being a brilliant half blood from an abusive background scared the old man, parallels to Voldemort running through his head. But as a child, he learned that he needed to make alliances with his loathsome dorm mates.</p>
<p>It wasn't a choice, not really. He needed protection, and they needed someone to help them with potions and were afraid of his inventiveness with curses. Some of them were actually rather decent. Avery and Rosier didn't sneer at him anymore. Sure, he had to learn a bit of their ideology so he could understand what they were talking about. He didn't really agree with it, but they offered him something he didn't know he wanted - a chance to belong.</p>
<p>He saw that Lily was listening to her friends. They all told her he was evil, disgusting, horrible, <em>dark</em>. And what was worse, he saw how she was attracted to James Potter, his main bully. It all came to a head when once again, Potter had humiliated him in front of the entire school. She came in and lashed out against James, but she was holding back a smile. She had found his humiliation funny. He had never felt so hurt, and so angry. So he said the most horrible thing he could think of to her. If she wouldn't learn to respect him because he was weak, then she would never feel what he would like her to feel.</p>
<p>She never forgave him. She forgave Potter for everything though. The fact that he was a bully, treated her possessively, was arrogant beyond belief, that was forgivable. Because he was rich, handsome, and oh so popular. Severus knew he would never be any of those. But, he could be powerful. He could have a group of allies that would be even more impressive than schoolyard popularity. He may have not believed in what they believed, but he didn't care.</p>
<p>They offered him everything he wanted. A higher education which he could never afford. Recognition for his brilliance. His own lab, with a couple of assistants. And really, as far as he knew, they weren't so bad. There were rumors, yes, but they were mostly a group of Slytherins, and everyone hated them and thought they were pure evil anyways. He brushed those aside.</p>
<p>He went to Albus Dumbledore, to try and get the Defense Against Dark Arts position, as that was an acceptable reward from his superiors. He tried to sneak into get an advantage, and while he heard some bullshit "prophecy" from the other side of the door, he was kicked out by the owner of the establishment in short order. He returned and told everyone the story. For some reason, the Big Man took some interest in it.</p>
<p>He returned to his lab, enjoying his work, the high salary, and within a few years, he could finish paying off the huge debts his father ran up. Life was fine, all in all. That is, until he heard that Lily was being targeted. He asked the Big Man to spare her, but Voldemort was unwilling to commit to anything other than saying he would try. So, he went to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>He became a spy. While she wasn't a friend, Lily had been the only person who had (for at a time) liked him for who he was. She became like everyone, who had just saw in him what he could offer. That meant more than she would ever understand. That was his most important memory - that at one time, someone actually cared.</p>
<p>Teaching was a nightmare. He loved Potions, but the students had no inclination, talent or respect for the subject. He had to be vicious in order to establish ground rules in the classroom. Some people remembered him as a beaten down runt. He had to disabuse them of that notion.</p>
<p>And then she died.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The next few years were a blur. Dumbledore and he knew that Voldemort would return. He learned to relax a bit with his sixth and seventh year students, who had some talent and respect for his subjects, but he could not drop his vicious monster persona. He favored the sons of his "comrades", and despite his disgust with the fact, didn't nurture the muggle-borns. He played up his loathing of Gryffindors. All to prepare for Voldemort's inevitable return.</p>
<p>And then came Harry Potter. No doubt rich and pampered like his parents were. A celebrity for all the wrong reasons - he stole the credit for his mother's sacrifice. And he looked just like James. When he first looked at the boy, he saw him looking back and wincing. The same instinctive hatred his father felt, no doubt. But he decided to give him one chance. If he had read to first chapter of the book, he'd know the answers. Just like Lily did. Perhaps he was her son even if he didn't look it except for his eyes. Of course, he didn't. James and his lazy arrogance all over again.</p>
<p>But those eyes haunted him. Every bad thing that happened in his life could be summed up with those eyes. And just like with Lily, all semblance of emotional control was lost whenever he looked at them. And protecting that little liar, who broke the rules over and again, lied (badly) to cover it up, and had his friends lie for him... and physically assault him for trying to defend the little shit. With the protection of everyone else in the staff, naturally. Of course they would. It was James Potter all over again.</p>
<p>And then, Dumbledore decided to reward the little idiot for his rule breaking. By humiliating Slytherin again. After all those years making Slytherin work together and understand that a single person couldn't beat them united, the headmaster took that away. His house wouldn't recover from this lesson in years to come.</p>
<p>Things got worse, as defense teacher after defense teacher were more incompetent, stupid, or plainly risked the students' lives (Remus Lupin would never give information about Sirius Black, no matter if he could protect the students by doing so). He returned to spying. Of course by then, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin did all they could with their bountiful spare time to make him a pariah in the Order. Really, to expect them to change was too much.</p>
<p>And then Dumbledore went and got himself killed. He tried to save him, but only ended up extending his life. The vicious bastard of a headmaster commanded him to become a murderer. And excused Harry bloody Potter for trying to murder another student, because really, the rules were beneath a Potter. Just a slap on the wrist for him. Some things never change when a Gryffindor tries to murder a Slytherin. No doubt in a few years he would brag about his wonderful "prank".</p>
<p>And then he became a killer. And the most hated man in the world. All to get a chance to protect the children of the school - because if he wouldn't be running the glorified concentration camp the school had become, it would have been Bellatrix and it would become a charnel house. He saved them from the worst of it, and managed to help Potter and his friends from behind the scenes. Getting them the sword, keeping the Death Eaters off their backs, all he could with the information he got from Phineas.</p>
<p>And then, just as he had a chance to complete his mission, get the final bit of information to the ungrateful brat, the rest of the staff decided to revolt. He didn't fight back. He just protected himself and ran. He'd find another chance to get Potter the final piece to Voldemort's fall.</p>
<p>Then, as he had guessed would happen, he finally died. As he got the infomation to Harry, he mused about his life. He failed to protect Lily. He failed to protect her son, who had to die. He never moved out of his home. All of his relationships were disasters, as he could not tell anyone the most important things about his life. He had no family. No friends. His last one, Charity, had begged him to help and he couldn't. He was the most hated man in the world. He would be remembered in history as the murderer of Albus Dumbledore. But finally, he didn't need to prove anything to anyone. It wasn't a happy end. But at least it was an end.</p>

<h4>[WP] Like Jury Duty, citizens can be called to perform their civic duty of performing an execution. What is the toll this has on a man?</h4>
<p>Score: 3485</p>
<p>It was his eighth time being chosen. At this point it had clearly stopped being random. He had friends who had never been picked, however, in the two years since the program had started he had been selected eight times. He knew why. He was good looking, and in the uniform they made him wear when he pressed the buttons that brought the pistons down and pumped the criminal full of fluid that would kill him within minutes, he looked sharp. He looked professional and people watching it all happen on TV liked that. It made them feel like they were watching a movie. He was their Denzel or their Hanks playing his part for the good of humanity. He was their Hector, forever standing in front of the gates protecting them. They cheered him as he eradicated the scum.</p>
<p>But he was done. Every night he went to bed wondering what time it would be when he would wake up in a cold sweat from the nightmares. The overwhelming guilt and sense of wrong had sunk so deep inside him that he was barely able to function. His work suffered, and his boss and coworkers knew, but pushing the button gave him a strange sort of fame so they let him slide. He rarely ate, sleep was impossible. He wasn't even able to get an erection. He had women mailing him their panties, but he was powerless to do anything about it.</p>
<p>His days consisted of going to work then coming home, sitting down on the couch, and staring at the TV until he was nodding off. Then he went to bed, made his guess, and tried to sleep. The only part of his day that he looked forward to was that first few seconds when the alarm went off. His eyes would open and he would fleetingly believe that Anne was still lying in bed next to him and that all was right. Then he would sit up and realize he was alone and it was just another grey day.</p>
<p>But today that was going to change. Today was lucky number eight. He drove to the facility just as he had done the previous seven times. He made small talk with the guards as he put on the uniform. They even joked with him; saying that it was he who should teach the class that showed what order to push the buttons in. They told him where to look in the audience as he carried out the act. He was to look in the direction of the victim’s family. His knowing gaze was a way of telling them that this execution was their personal justice; as if somehow everything would now be okay for them. </p>
<p>He passed on the meal they offered then as time drew near he followed the guards to his position. The curtains opened to reveal the audience and the lights came on. He saw the red light on the camera come to life. They were now live on television. At the prompt the host introduced the prisoner who was strapped to a table and fitted with the correct IV’s. The host told everyone at home what this man’s crimes were and why he was being put to death. Normally at this point his heart would be hammering in his chest and his palms would be sweaty, but today was different. He felt calm. He glanced at the prisoner who locked eyes with him and gave him a pleading look hoping there was something he could do. </p>
<p>He could hear the host as he started the countdown from twenty and stepped out of the room. Everyone was gone. It was just him and the prisoner. As the count hit zero he was to look at the victim’s family and then press the buttons in the correct order. That didn’t happen.</p>
<p>The count hit zero. After a short pause, he stepped away from the buttons and pulled a small knife he had hidden from the guards out of his pocket. He used it to drag a deep cut across his left wrist. Instantly the blood started flowing, cascading onto the white floor like a crimson waterfall. He then gripped the knife with everything he had and drove it into his throat. As he fell to the floor the last thing he saw was the audience. They were in shock. Looks of horror raced across their faces as some screamed in fear and others tried to flee. It was as if they had come to watch an execution and were surprised to see someone die. </p>

I had a clear idea about a guy who was "chosen" and became kind of the star of this morbid show and how the guilt of what he was doing had finally soaked through him and destroyed everything in his life.

<p>These old eyes of mine have probably seen everything. I've seen species grow from single cells to monstrous, frighteningly smart creatures. I've seen civilizations rise, fall, rise again. Been a part of more than a few myself. I've been witness to every conflict I can imagine, from petty personal passive-aggression to skirmishes between tribes to planetary-scale turf wars all the way up to intergalactic grudges. Conflict never really changes, as far as I can tell. I've seen love, too. Not nearly enough of it, mind.</p>
<p>I've seen black holes form, nebulae birthing stars, solar systems spin from nonexistence into form. Cosmic dreamscapes and heavenly formations playing out in slow motion over billions, trillions of old Earth years. Can't say for sure how long I've watched the lights. I lose track of time as I float on.</p>
<p>"It'll never get old," I said once. "The universe. Massive, unpredictable, shining beauty that she is." Turns out someone, somewhere was listening - and they found it funny. When my time was up, when normally I'd finally be uncoiled from this mortality, I found myself sticking around. No light at the end of the tunnel, just a voice.</p>
<p>"THE UNIVERSE REPEATS. IN ITS INFINITY OF INFINITIES THERE IS NOTHING TRULY NEW. EVERYTHING THAT WAS, IS, WILL BE IS ALREADY OLDER THAN CAN BE EXPRESSED. YOU BELIEVE YOU WILL NEVER TIRE? PROVE THIS TO ME."</p>
<p>It's been a few cycles since then. The universe repeats, they said. That's true. I've seen all that anything can be, every possible configuration of atoms, strings, or whatever things really are deep down. I have literally seen <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>It's a good thing I can't remember any of it.</p>
<p>See, the human mind is an interesting piece of hardware. Thrives on novelty. If you do one single thing enough times, you'll bore eventually. Whoever keeps me around here wagered that that'd hold true. The human mind only has so much storage, though. Only so many memories fit in the lump of meat and electricity. If you fill it up, every time you see something, every time you <em>perceive</em>, you'll lose something. It's like overfilling a bathtub. You add some water, some more splashes out.</p>
<p>Imagine that to infinity. My mind, cycling through the universe's water supply. Forgetting and making new memories. Every time I see completely alien art, every time I float through a cluster of stars, every time I love and lose and love again, I thrill.</p>
<p>It might not be <em>new</em>. But it's new to me.</p>

<p>EDIT: 1 day later. The response has been completely unexpected and overwhelming. I'm not at all sure how to respond, so I hope this will do.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who read this and enjoyed it. I only very recently began writing fiction, and I didn't expect so many people to respond so well to my early efforts. I'm still convinced that this whole thing was a combination of beginner's luck, a compelling prompt (thank you u/Gravitiaxis), and being in the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>Living life as a turtle meant I could live a long time. I'd have plenty of time to accomplish all of my goals. Throughout my life I had gathered riches, built castles, and attained more power than any other turtle before me. That was all great, but what I wanted more than anything was a wife; someone to spend time with and care about. </p>
<p>It was over twenty years ago when I found the woman of my dreams. However, she never loved me back. I tried desperately for years to get her to enjoy her time with me. I took her on all sorts of special dates-  underwater, in space, in one of my many homes. </p>
<p>But every time I've tried to take her out, some god awful plumber shows up, occasionally bringing his good-for-nothing friends, and spoils my time. I haven't quite figured him out after all this time, but I think he's jealous of me. </p>
<p>For example, last week I took the girl of my dreams for a go-kart ride up to my castle since she loves the view up there. Next thing I knew, the plumber found me and was trying to smash my head in with his feet! He stole my woman from me, and left me to die. My shell was cracked, my love was taken away again, and the man with the mustache smiled.</p>

<hr />
<p>You'd be surprised how easy it was to live in the world where superpowers were the norm. Even though I didn't have super powers, it was easy to get around, they didn't expect everyone to have super strength, or everyone to fly, so I was able to just always be the person who needed help. Nothing too bad. It was pretty annoying, not having a power that was useful, but I'd been dealing with it as long as I'd been alive, so I was surviving.</p>
<p>My power was increased perception, and minor at that. I could notice the pulled thread on anyone's sweater, I could see that someone had been crying the day before based on a slight difference in the colour of their eye. For all intents and purposes, I was just someone who paid attention, meanwhile my friend Todd could throw a car several city blocks, as long as he was with Laura.</p>
<p>Power was tied to your soul mate, which meant that as long as your soul mate was around, you were unbelievably more powerful, which meant that I would probably REALLY notice her. Not that it mattered, people usually didn't meet their soul mates, there were seven billion of us, and you only had one soul mate, chances were that she or he was somewhere in China, flying around or some shit.</p>
<p>So I kept watching the bubbles in my beer float up, I could tell you what speed they were going at, or what the other people were drinking based on the colour of their glass, but it was a party trick, "Toby," Todd cut in, "Earth to Toby."</p>
<p>"Present," I said, glancing up at him, his arm around Laura, showing off the relationship to everyone at the table.</p>
<p>"You excited to meet your soul mate?"</p>
<p>"Ha," I sat myself up so I was at least paying attention to him. He was taking the time and effort to set me up with one of his friends from work, I might as well try to seem interested. It wasn't easy to convince girls to date a guy who couldn't take them on a flight somewhere, "What's she like?"</p>
<p>"Dude, I've been telling you for the past hour,"</p>
<p>"Well I wasn't paying,"</p>
<p>"Yeah you were, you can't, not pay attention," he pointed out the flaw in my argument, "you just wanted to check if I could keep the story straight."</p>
<p>"Guilty."</p>
<p>"Well I'm telling you, she's hot and she sucks like you."</p>
<p>"Cool." I caught the glare from Laura on the hot comment, she was the kind of girl who checked your phone at night, "What time is she getting here?"</p>
<p>"Why don't you tell me, cowboy?" He said and then the door opened across the bar, I flicked my eyes over to look at who was walking in and caught her. To call her a smoke show would be a disservice to how hot she was. She was the kind of girl who got rejected from model shoots for making the rest of the girls look bad. If that was the girl that Todd had gotten for me, I needed to buy him tickets to the fucking Bahamas.</p>
<p>"Is that her at the door Todd?" There wasn't a response, "Earth to Todd?" Still no response, I looked over to him, blank-faced with a dumb smile, but not moving at all. I flicked my eyes over to the girl at the door, she was still walking in. I stood up to get to her.</p>
<p>"Hi," I said, holding out my hand to her, "I think you're stopping time or something by accident."</p>
<p>"I can't do that," she said with a smile, "pretty sure that's you."</p>
<p>"You know Todd?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Well I'm Toby, and trust me, I can't do that either."</p>

<p>Score: 3233</p>
<p>Another gigantic hand hammered into John's shoulder, but this time he was ready and did not stumble. The crowd had roared with laughter when Vismar the Red had made Cena almost fall to the floor, as he had "merely" welcomed him with a clap on the back and John had not dared stumble since. </p>
<p>These men, these gigantic men, they loomed over John and slopped their foul smelling alcohol on him as they cheered him and pulled him through the crowd. This was a dream, it must be a dream, but as tightly as he screwed his eyes up, or pinched himself, the world did not go away. </p>
<p>John had always been one of the largest men in the room, but the average height here was approaching seven feet tall and the muscles were hard knots that had been earned by swinging heavy meta, not by pumping iron. it didn't make sense, none of it made sense, he was supposed to be flying to Orlando for a veterans match against Randy, not here, not... wherever he was. </p>
<p>He looked down at his hands again, they were smooth and felt strong, like they had when he was twenty nine and at his physical peak. He flexed his fingers and watched as each muscle in his arm responded in kind, it was... incredible. His body was sculpted, tight, ready to go, he hadn't felt this good in... in decades.</p>
<p><strong><em>"JOHN CENA"</em></strong> The voice boomed across the room and made John's head snap up, he'd barely paid attention to where he was going since his arrival, but now the men in front cleared to the side and made a path. Ahead was a gigantic gilded throne and on it was the most massive man John had ever seen. </p>
<p>The voice was like trucks accelerating in a tunnel, deep, booming and indicating incredible power. <strong><em>"GREETINGS JOHN OF CENA, YOU ARE MUCH WELCOMED HERE IN VALHALLA"</em></strong> </p>
<p>The crowd was suddenly silent and the huge men seemed to be awaiting his response. He smiled weakly. "Okay, hi." There was a moment's pause and the crowd roared in laughter. </p>
<p>On his throne the huge man wiped away a tear and nudged the man nearest him <strong><em>"FORSOOTH! CLASSIC CENA, JUST CLASSIC!"</em></strong> </p>
<p>The men still laughed and John  looked around, confused. "I don't... I don't really get it. What's going on here?" </p>
<p>Finally the laughter subsided and the huge man controlled himself. <strong><em>"VERILY, I AM SORRY JOHN, WE SHOULD NOT LAUGH, BUT WE HAVE FOLLOWED YOU FOR MANY YEARS IN YOUR BATTLES AND... WELL, WE'RE PRETTY HUGE FANS."</em></strong> </p>
<p>This place was getting to him; John slowly turned and took it in. there were faces all around, bright and eager to hear what he had to say, but... they were warrior men, huge leather-bound and covered in scars. He'd come here on a horse with a fat woman and he was in the body he'd owned many year ago. "I'm dead?" </p>
<p>There was a silence and the room was suddenly filled with eyes that would not meet his. <strong><em>"INDEED, I KNOW THAT IT IS HARD FOR A WARRIOR TO ACCEPT, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO VALHALLA MY SON, WHERE THE REWARD FOR A LIFE TIME OF BATTLES IS TO  FEAST AT THE SIDE OF ODIN!"</em></strong> </p>
<p>Slowly things began to make sense to John - this was a gig. He'd seen these expressions day in and day out on the road, wide eyed and excited. These were <em>fans</em> and he was here to perform. Dead, dreaming, it didn't matter, all that mattered was that he was here to entertain. For forty three years John had stepped into the ring and left it all out there and now it was time to do it again. </p>
<p>The crowd had begun to murmur, but silence sharply fell as his hand shot into the air, fingers splayed. With great care, John reached down and deliberately paused, before pumping up his sneakers twice and then jumping to his feet. </p>
<p>"You brought me here to Feast Odin? You think I want to spend me days getting fat and slow? What? You wanna go? I'm here to battle, I'm here to fight, you betta take fright, because I'm Mister Friday Night!" The old words came back easily, the promo flowing as it always had. </p>
<p>Odin leaned over to the man nearest him and whispered excitedly. <strong><em>"THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD, LOOK, HE'S GETTING ALL WORKED UP AND HE'S..."</em></strong> John ripped off his shirt. <strong><em>"OOH, I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DO THAT, I TOTALLY WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY IT."</em></strong> </p>
<p>"Stuff that old man, I came here to <em>get busy</em> and all I see here are a bunch of old men and..." he paused and confusion crept into his voice. "What looks to be my accountant Ted in the corner." Ted waved miserably to John. "So am I gonna get a match or what?" </p>
<p>Odin smiled widely. <strong><em>"INDEED JOHN, WE HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR MANY YEARS. AS ONE OF THE BRAVEST WARRIORS IN EARTH'S HISTORY, WE HAVE PREPARED A MATCH SUITABLE TO YOUR LEVEL."</em></strong> </p>
<p>The crowd parted again and a gigantic man walked forward, over eight feet tall and with muscles bigger than John's head. His sword was nearly five feet long and seemed to split the air with a slight tearing noise. He was bound from head to foot in spiked metal armor, with only his face showing, allowing John to see his scarred face, teeth sharpened to spikes and a demonic smile. </p>
<p>Odin waved his hand casually. <strong><em>"OF COURSE, IT WILL NEED TO BE A BATTLE WITH SOMETHING ON THE LINE, SO WE WILL PIT YOUR IMMORTAL SOUL AGAINST KRATHNAR THE INVINCIBLE'S. OH AND HONESTLY JOHN, WE'RE SUPER EXCITED FOR THIS, WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AGES, SO TRY NOT TO FINISH HIM OFF TOO QUICKLY."</em></strong> </p>

<p>June went first - that was just her way. </p>
<p>We both knew it was coming - well into our 90th year of life, having been together for 60, we may as well have been a single organism. Not a single person, alive or dead, knew either one of us better than we knew each other. </p>
<p>"I'll be the first to go," she'd said suddenly. I had laughed and told her not to be silly, that I had to go first so she could be sure I actually did it. </p>
<p>She'd simply smiled sadly, and patted my hand in a comforting way. </p>
<p>"I'm serious, Jeb. I can feel it."</p>
<p>And she'd been right, as she always had. </p>
<p>I had watched her slip away, watched her breathing grow shallower until her chest barely rose, then simply didn't rise again. </p>
<p>My heart broke, and in that moment, I knew I wouldn't be far behind her. I stayed just long enough to make sure she passed comfortably.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, June," I'd thought to myself as I increased the morphine drip in my arm well past the overdose mark, "I'm right behind you." </p>
<p>It's always been a cliché, but as I slipped from this life and departed for the next, I found myself in a bright tunnel. Light rushed towards me, and I could hear her calling to me, beckoning me forward. </p>
<p>I reached the light, and everything went black. </p>

<h4>[WP]Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?</h4>
<p>Score: 3206</p>
<p>So get a load of this. I had this idea.  I was thinking, how am I going to kill one of the most antagonistic political figures of the 20th century? <br />
I thought, hey, a sperm whale--- <br />
It started with a sperm whale anyway. I was just going to drop a <em>sperm whale</em> on him. Then I realized, I wasn't going to get points just for subtelty or difficulty. <em>Anyone</em> can drop something on someone. Hell, the third winner used an ambulance. Points for creativity <em>and</em> irony that year. <br />
Then, I figured it out. An <em>homage</em> to the old days of this noble sport. <br />
So I went back to a further time, earlier in the era. Found this old man, and asked him what he thought of some paintings I brought with me. <br />
Here's where we pick up the pace.   <br />
I asked him about <em>Adolf Hitler's</em> paintings. He thought out loud as old men always do (even in the 20th century!) and said, he never heard of him, but the painting technique was "disappointing."<br />
Then I asked him to repeat himself, and say, "Adolf Hitler's art, was disappointing."  <br />
So he did.<br />
I asked him to <em>yell</em> it, tell all who would hear a master's opinion of this work. <br />
<em>JUST</em> as he was about to respond, I teleport him over Hitler making a public speech in Berlin three decades later. You can see this old man <em>zooming</em> down into the sky. In the tape, you can barely see Hitler raise his eyebrows. <em>That's</em> when he realizes someone was yelling his name from above.<br />
You have no idea how difficult it was calculating the <em>exact</em> velocity to get the old man's adrenaline going, give him time to speak, and have Hitler hear him.<br />
And there! That's how I pulled it off.<br />
I killed Adolf Hitler by dropping his painting idol, Rudolf von Alt, far above his head, <em>while</em> he was yelling out his opinion of Hitler's paintings for all of Berlin to hear. It was the last thing he ever heard.  <br />
And Rudolf called his paintings <em>crap!</em><br />
The bonus points for intricacy <em>and</em> emotional devastation got me the victory.    </p>

<h4>[WP] A man orders a "cheese pizza with no crust" from a local pizza delivery joint as a joke. Unbeknownst to him, that pizza joint is a drug front and he just placed an order for a kilo of cocaine.</h4>
<p>Score: 3202</p>
<p>At the sound of the doorbell, I heaved myself from my seat. </p>
<p>I moved over to the door, ready to go on an angry rant about the time. Who the hell thought two in the morning was a good time to turn up at your house? They could’ve woken me up! They didn’t, but they could’ve, and it’s the thought that counts.</p>
<p>I opened the door and my words died on my lips. A man in a pizza deliveryman’s costume stood there, smoking a cigarette and flanked by two burly men in tracksuits. Behind them, a bright red SUV was parked, its lights off but engine still gently running.</p>
<p>“Uh…hi?”</p>
<p>The pizza man dropped his cigarette. “Show us the money first.”</p>
<p>I glanced around. “Am…am I being robbed?”</p>
<p>The man snorted. “Robbed? Hell no. We’ve got the best prices around.”</p>
<p>I looked at the symbol on the man’s hat and came to a sudden realisation. “You’re from Notmafiosos’ Pizza Parlour!”</p>
<p>“Hell yeah, I am. Now where’s the money?”</p>
<p>“I called you guys six hours ago.” Prank-called them, to be specific, asking for a ridiculous order. Come to think of it, I hadn’t even given them my address.</p>
<p>The pizza man snorted. “What, you thought we were gonna come in broad daylight? And people don’t normally ask for such massive amounts.”</p>
<p>“I only asked for a cheese pizza with no crust.”</p>
<p>“Man, what do you mean ‘only’? It would take years to get through a cheese pizza without the crust. What do you normally buy?”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. “A Hawaiian pizza with no cheese or pineapple.”</p>
<p>The pizza man’s eyes widened. “Holy shit, dude. Are you some kind of millionaire?” He turned back to one of the men. “This guy’s a real buyer; go get the product.”</p>
<p>The man nodded and headed back to the SUV. He rooted around in it for a minute before turning the lights on, revealing a myriad of logos for Notmafiosos’ Pizza Parlour that I somehow hadn’t seen before.</p>
<p>He returned soon, clutching a briefcase, which he handed to the pizza man, who laid it on the floor and clicked it open, revealing a pristine pizza box. Slowly and carefully, he stood, and then handed it to me.</p>
<p>“It’s all in there, dude.”</p>
<p>What the hell were these guys on about? I opened the box.</p>
<p>“Guys, I didn’t order a box of flour.”</p>

<h4>[WP] Today everyone woke up with price tags floating over their heads, indicating the value of their life. Your tag is $50Tn, the biggest by far, and you have no idea why.</h4>
<p>Score: 3113</p>
<p>When people asked why I’m worth so much, I shrugged. I mean, what am I supposed to say? It’s a question as random as: “why are your eyes blue?” or “how’d you get to be so tall?”. There’s no right way to answer it without bullshitting.</p>
<p>Sure, I could say it’s genetics, but I highly doubt that. My father’s a farmer and is married to a stay-at-home mom. They’re nice people, of course, but nice doesn’t seem to correlate to value. They both barely scratch a hundred thousand dollars combined.</p>
<p>I could say it was a mistake. After all, there wasn’t always an explanation. Most people who did stand out were famous in some facet but every once in a while, a baby was born with an exceptional price. I feel bad for them. They have to live a life of everyone bearing down on them to reach their full potential. I’m just lucky that I’m already in my twenties and a somewhat established carpenter.  It pays the bill and that’s all I need.</p>
<p>That was, until I gained worldwide recognition.</p>
<p>Ever since I’ve been valued at fifty trillion – yes, you read it right – people have been treating me a lot differently. Old friends, past girlfriends, and annoying family members have popped out of the woodwork like crazy to capitalize on my newfound fame. Suddenly, I was desirable because of the unknown. And as far as they knew, it was better to make friends than enemies.</p>
<p>I became the focus of many scientists. They figured if I didn’t have political, monetary, or social power, it must have been something inside me that was unique. A series of tests were run on my body, analyzing every single cell for what makes me tick. The results were a little… <em>unsatisfactory</em>.</p>
<p>Superior athletic ability? Nope.</p>
<p>Cancer-resistant genes? Unfortunately, no.</p>
<p>Unexplainable superpowers? Only in my dreams.</p>
<p>After wearing me to the bone with tests and sucking me dry of blood, they gave up their attempts. As far as they could tell, I was an enigma no one knew how to solve. And at the rate they were going, I was going to be long dead before they made any headway.</p>
<p>Then the paparazzi came into play. Do you know what it’s like being stalked by a gaggle of sleazebags with cameras who have no sense of personal space? I have one word for it – shitty.</p>
<p>Well, one day, I was jogging at the nearby park. In hindsight, it was stupid, but I thought it was safe enough. I never expected them to swarm me like a cloud of bees. But by the time they surrounded me, it was too late to get away.</p>
<p>So I did what any reasonable person would, I sprinted like hell. In fact, I ran so fast that I didn’t even notice I was on a direct course for the pond in front of me. By the time I realized, I already had one foot on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>And then another.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was <em>running</em> on water. It wasn’t a mind-trick, at least not as far as I could tell. I was actually doing it of my own accord.</p>
<p>I turned back to the paparazzi. They were momentarily stunned but started to snap photos again. After all, they had to get the perfect shot. It would be the height of anyone’s career once it reached the tabloids.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to see the first photo proof of the Second Coming.</p>

<p>Score: 3089</p>
<p>I pulled the cellophane-wrapped pieces of meat from out of the fridge and checked the label. Useless, of course. Though I was grateful that Satan always kept the fridge fully stocked, I just wish that he would go to a grocery store that sold things in English. Everything that he brought home was marked with like, ancient Sumerian cuneiform or something. </p>
<p>"Satan, what is this?" I asked, holding up the package over the counter in the kitchen so that he could see it from the living room. He looked just like any other guy. Tall, kind of lanky, with black hair and black eyes. Not breathtakingly handsome, but not too bad either. And when he spoke, he had just the slightest hint of an accent that I just couldn't quite place. Probably because it wasn't from anywhere on Earth. </p>
<p>He was deep into a game of Battlefront, enjoying frying some rebel scum as the Emperor. You'd think he'd get tired of that sort of thing (given what he does for a living) but apparently not. "Uhh, what does it look like?" he asked, not taking his eyes off of the screen. </p>
<p>I looked back down at the pieces of meat. It was pinkish. "It looks like pork chops," I told him. </p>
<p>"Gah!" he shook the controller violently; someone had killed his character. Finally he looked up at the package in my hands with a swift glance. "Yeah, totally pork," he answered.</p>
<p>"You sure?" There were some parcels in the fridge marked "DO NOT EAT" (in English, for me) that he got for his demon friends that occasionally came over. And they looked <em>very</em> similar to pork. </p>
<p>He squinted at the cuneiform writing. "Yeah, it's pork."</p>
<p>"Cool." I ripped open the packaging and put a pat of butter into a pan. "You want some dinner too? Cider-glazed pork chops?"</p>
<p>"Sounds awesome!" he said, going back to his game. </p>
<p>I hummed as I cooked. It had been a long time since I'd done that. There was just something so comforting about listening to the sizzling pan, mixed with the sound of explosions and blaster fire coming from the TV (as well as some intermittent shouting from Satan as his Tie fighter was shot down). And the smell of the onions sauteing. And the warmth coming from the pan. It just felt... like home. </p>
<p>There was a loud thumping on the door, like someone was trying to get in with a battering ram. Satan glanced at me with a quizzical look, then towards the door. "I got it," He got up from the couch just as I started to move away from the pan. "You keep an eye on my dinner," he said with a grin. </p>
<p>I heard the creak of hinges, followed shortly by Tom's voice. My blood ran cold immediately. "Where's Sarah?" he shouted at Satan. </p>
<p>"And who might you be?" Satan answered calmly. I had told him about the situation when I moved in, of course. That I'd just gotten out of a relationship, and that it hadn't exactly ended well. But I really hadn't gone into all the details about <em>why</em> we'd broken up, and <em>how</em> Tom had acted when I finally broke the news to him. Satan didn't need to know that. That was between me, Tom, and the cops who had responded that night. </p>
<p>"Her <em>boyfriend</em>," Tom answered. Even without seeing him, I could tell that he was itching to pick a fight. "Now <em>where is she?</em> We need to talk."</p>
<p>"You know," Satan told him, "I don't think she really wa..."</p>
<p>"It's ok," I interrupted him, coming into the hallway behind Satan. "It's fine. We can talk."</p>
<p>Tom had a smug grin on his face, and he glared at Satan. "Yeah. We just need to talk. So butt out."</p>
<p>Satan was still standing between the two of us. He glanced at me with his thick black eyebrows arched, silently asking 'you sure you're ok with this?' I gave him a very slight nod, and he backed away and let me pass into the doorway. </p>
<p>Once Satan went back into the living room, Tom grabbed me by the wrist and pulled me out onto the porch. He reached around me and slammed the door shut. "What the <em>fuck</em>, Sarah? You're <em>already</em> shacking up with some other guy?"</p>
<p>"We're not <em>shacking up!</em>" I shouted back at him, though my voice was breaking with fear. "He's just my <em>roommate</em>."</p>
<p>Tom scoffed. "Yeah, <em>bullshit</em>. Was this already going on when we were dating?" He clenched his teeth and breathed heavily through his nostrils. "I swear, Sarah, if you were cheating on me..."</p>
<p>"I <em>just</em> told you," I shouted back at him, "There's nothing going on between us! And besides, it's none of your business. I <em>dumped you</em>, remember?"</p>
<p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw his hand clench into a fist, and rage flashed through his eyes. My body tensed up involuntarily, expecting the blow.</p>
<p>The front door swung open again. "All right, buddy. Time for you to go," Satan told Tom. "<em>NOW</em>."</p>
<p>"Or what?" Tom asked, puffing out his chest and turning away from me. "You going to call the cops? Why don't we settle this like men?" He cracked his knuckles and grimaced, as if he wasn't being clear enough already.</p>
<p>Satan stepped out onto the porch with an affable smile. "Gladly," he answered. "Except..." </p>
<p>He began to grow. It was hardly noticeable at first, but he was Tom's height in just a matter of seconds, whereas he'd been at least three inches shorter when he stepped through that doorway. And not just up, but <em>out</em>. Muscles bulged from his arms and chest and legs until he looked like a bodybuilder. His pale skin turned fire-engine red, and a bristly black goatee sprouted from his chin in a matter of seconds. His affable smile became horrifying and menacing when his teeth became sharpened fangs. And, as a nice little cherry on top, thick ram's horns sprouted from his forehead and spiraled out until the spiky tips were jutting into Tom's face.</p>
<p>"Except I'm <em>not</em> a man," he boomed in a terrifyingly deep voice.</p>
<p>Tom bolted back to his car with a wet stain on his crotch. He didn't even <em>look</em> at me. </p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Satan crowed after him. "I thought you wanted to settle this!" His taunt was answered by the squeal of tires, and a crash as Tom reversed out of his parking spot and straight into the back of another car in the lot. Satan let out a deep, booming laugh and put one massive arm over my shoulder. "Come on, Sarah. We wouldn't want dinner to burn." He led me back inside, and slowly transformed back into his human self.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry you had to see that," he finally told me.</p>
<p>"No, I..." I really didn't have words. Tears began to roll down my cheeks. "No, <em>I'm</em> sorry. For Tom. And for not telling you what an asshole he was. And.. and... thank you, so much. You just... <em>God</em>, I'd give anything for a drink right now."</p>
<p>Satan smirked. "I told you not to use that name in this house." He crossed the room and found a bottle of white wine in the fridge, then poured me a glass.</p>
<p>I reached out to take it, but he jerked it away quickly. "Ah ah ah! Not so fast." He twirled the stem of the glass deftly between his fingers. "You said you'd give <em>anything</em> for a drink?" His smile became wicked and devious. "How about <em>your soul</em>?"</p>
<p>I stared at him in shock, unsure how to respond. As soon as he revealed who he really was, I <em>knew</em> this day would come eventually. I just hadn't thought it would be <em>now</em>. All I could think of was that the onions were starting to burn.</p>
<p>"Nah, I'm just fucking with you," he laughed, handing me the drink. </p>

<p>"Oh yeah? What about all them voodoo ladies from all them pirate stories?" Fatman-John intervened, joining them by the stern.</p>
<p>From the corner, Golden-Tooth Jackson watched them in silence.</p>
<p>"Legend is," One-Legged Jimmy continued, "that them witches in this part of the sea can turn into anyone at will! And fool a whole crew! Bring down the boat!"</p>

Captain… or what used to be the Captain.</p>
<p>In his place, a gray-haired, crooked-nose witch in black robes and a pointy hat hovered a few feet from the ground, green smoke rising from the wood under her feet.</p>
<p>"Told ya! The captain be a witch!"</p>
<p>"Well, that be odd," Fatman said, scratching his head.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Cause I be a witch too." Fatman said, turning to a witch not unlike the Captain in front of the other's eyes.</p>
<p>"You be a witch? Then why you be arguing that there is witches in pirate stories?" The Captain asked. "Why you 
not pretending you don't know 'bout witches like me?"</p>
<p>"I be trying to throw you off," Fatman-now-witch replied.</p>
<p>"I'll be darned, me too," One-Legged Jimmy joined, turning into a witch himself.</p>
<p>"Well that makes four of us," Bald Nick intervened, as he too turned to a pointy-hatted old lady.</p>
<p>The four witches exchanged looks. "Guess witches be pretty common in pirate stories, heh?"</p>
<p>"Aye."</p>
<p>"Aye."</p>
<p>"Aye."</p>
<p>From his corner, Golden-Tooth Jackson's eyes were wide like the full moon above.</p>

<h4>[WP] You're the person who keeps mowing lawns during the zombie apocalypse of The Walking Dead.</h4>
<p>Score: 2971</p>
<p>Everyone in the world has lost their minds. Literally: it infected our blood and then spread to the cerebellum. We lost ourselves.</p>
<p>Hardly a surprise, though. Looting, rioting, murdering, cannibalism... hard to <em>keep</em> your mind in that kind of environment, much less be happy, right? Happiness vanished from the world.</p>
<p>Except for in me.</p>
<p>I was bitten almost three months ago. God, has it really been that long? I watched the whole neighborhood go to shit, utterly terrified and panicked like everyone else. One by one, the neighbors turned. We watched out of the second story window, because the downstairs was all boarded up. We saw old Mr. Howard biting little Linda Root right there in the street. My family and I watched her corpse bleed out onto the sidewalk, then get back up again an hour later and start roaming the street. </p>
<p>I still don't know how they got to my wife. All I know is that I came back from a supply run, opened up the garage door, and found her sinking her teeth into my shoulder. And that was the end, I thought.</p>
<p>The end. In just a few short hours, I'd be one of them. I could take my own life, of course: it wasn't an unpopular decision. Better than trying to feast on your remaining friends as a ghoul, right? But I couldn't do it. I was a coward. So I did what any man would do: popped open a beer and fired up the riding lawnmower. </p>
<p>For some people, it's basking on a sandy beach with a margarita in hand. For other people, it's jumping out of a plane and plummeting toward the ground until they finally pull that ripcord. For my wife, it was exploring every damn store in the mall for the hundredth time. Everyone has their "zen" activity, and mine was mowing the lawn. She was my pride and joy, and it showed in the lush green color. </p>
<p>It was dark by the time I'd finished up. The rest of the zombies around me could smell the bite. They knew I wasn't long for the world, so they left me alone. Just me and John Deere against the world. I may die soon, but my lawn would live on as a testament to my abilities. Years from now, when the world is reclaimed, someone will come by and say, "Wow, the grass here is shorter and neater than any of the other lots." That would be my legacy.</p>
<p>But somehow... nothing was happening. No fever, no dizziness... none of the symptoms anyone else experienced after a bite. I felt better than ever (though that might have been from the beer, and maybe a touch of sun stroke).</p>
<p>I crawled into bed, at least happy that I'd managed to enjoy my one last day on Earth. I'd probably turn in the night, so I handcuffed myself to the bed frame. One less walker for the survivors to worry about, I guess.</p>
<p>I woke up the next morning with the sun in my eyes and the smell of freshly-caught grass wafting through the window. Well, freshly cut grass and rotting flesh. But we can't have <em>everything</em>, can we? The important part was that I hadn't turned yet. Susan had <em>definitely</em> bitten me; I had the marks to prove it. And she was <em>definitely</em> infected. So what was it?</p>
<p>I fired up the lawnmower again. My lawn was already perfect, but Dr. Metnis's lawn hadn't seen care in weeks. He was one of the first on the block to go. Probably one of the first in the state; he'd been at the hospital when the initial outbreak occurred. One of the very first patients had taken a chunk out of his hand, and we hadn't seen him since. So, I rode over and cut his grass too (and had a few more beers; why fix what ain't broken?).</p>
<p>The bite seemed to be healing. It was something about the lawns. About how it calmed me down. As best I can guess, with my <em>very</em> rudimentary knowledge of chemistry and biology, it's the adrenaline. <em>Fear</em> is what sets off the virus. No one has noticed so far because <em>of course</em> everyone who has been bitten was freaking out. <em>Everyone</em> is terrified nowadays. Murderous, bloodthirsty ghouls, constantly being on the run, fearing for your life from other survivors... there is no more safety for anyone, and thus no more immunity. And the closer someone gets to death, the more they panic, which just speeds up the virus. My final zen ritual of mowing the lawn seems to have saved my life.</p>
<p>So I did what any reasonable man would do: I kept mowing. If I needed to stay calm to avoid setting off the virus, then I needed more lawns, and more beer. So I cleared highway medians on my way between supply runs. I groomed the lawns of homes before looting their supply cupboards. I cleaned up city parks before taking what I needed from stores and pharmacies. </p>
<p>Someday, there will be a cure. I have to have hope that someone out there is working on it; it's all about keeping that positive, zen state of mind. In the meantime, I need to keep going. Luckily for me, there's plenty of grass in America. </p>

<p>Elizabeth stepped out from the wall and snapped the neck of the guard as he walked past. The guy never had a chance.<br />
Catching his assault rifle before it hit the floor, she lowered his body to the ground and dragged it to an alcove, out of the main corridor.<br />
Five soldiers down now; only ten remained between her and the ambassador. 
As she slipped through the militarised embassy, she reflected on how she had got here - how much simpler life had been just a few months ago.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Liz had started out as a hairdresser, but quickly became disenchanted by the business. Getting to the second level was simple enough - she just had to do enough bowl-cuts - but once she saw the styles progression tree laid out before her, she realised that this wasn't what she wanted to do with her life. Sure, she might one day style for the stars, but that would be small consolation for the time and energy invested.<br />
It was by chance she saw the man on her way back from the salon. Under normal circumstances she shouldn't have even been able to detect his presence - even with his guard down, it was virtually a miracle.<br />
"You have the <em>gift</em>" he told her, "otherwise we would never have met. You shall become my apprentice."  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Two guards fell to quickly timed blows to the neck. Again, they hadn't noticed her until it was far, far to late. Incapacitated, she cuffed them with their own equipment, then pushed them into a small office and locked the door.<br />
Her mentor would have been proud. She was doing well.<br />
Voices came down the corridor and she ghosted up to a pot plant, then became <em>one</em> with the indoor palm. The squad of mercenaries ran right past her and she slipped from cover, continuing on towards her target.<br />
She became lost in her recollections again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
"You might have the gift, but you do not practice enough!" snarled her mentor.<br />
Shamed, she stared hopelessly at the man, his beret waggling as he shook his head.<br />
"I'll... I'll try harder," she offered.<br />
"No, you must go out into the world and hone your skills in the field, only then will you become a master of our craft."<br />
With that, he had vanished, never to be seen again. Elizabeth had cried, raged and pleaded, but Master Rene had never returned.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Bullets flashed around her.<br />
<em>Shit!</em><br />
She hadn't expected there to be auto-turrets. She could fool the minds of men, but not machines.<br />
Panting, she composed herself and <em>focussed.</em><br />
Five deep breaths and she stood, then placed her hands in the air in front of her, moving slowly forward.<br />
Bullets rattled and careened off the force-field in front of her, the metal slugs impacting on the invisible wall as she carefully crab-stepped through the room.<br />
After a fraught sixty seconds, she was <em>through</em> - unscathed by the automatic fire from the twin machine gun turrets.<br />
The door to the ambassador's chamber stood before her.
No doubt it would be trapped.<br />
Standing clear, she carefully shaped her hands and started to <em>pull</em>.<br />
As though guided by invisible hands, the heavy door began to open.<br />
Straining, Liz hauled hand over hand until the door stood open - and a fan of poison darts shot from the lintel, where she would have been standing.<br />
Inside the ambassador cowered behind his desk, a gun in his meaty hand.<br />
"Where are you!" cried the plump man, "who are you?"<br />
Liz allowed herself to be seen.<br />
Terror washed over the man's face as he gazed upon her beret, her suspenders, her white face-paint and black slacks.<br />
"Oh my god," he whined.<br />
Liz smiled viciously.<br />
No one escaped a <em>grandmaster mime</em>.</p>

<h4>[EU] The Iron Giant is thrown into the world of Pacific Rim</h4>
<p>Score: 2899</p>
<p>The year was 2026. It had been nearly 2 years since we destroyed the portal between our world and that of those creating the Kaiju clones. The Jaeger program had been largely shut down following the news that the Kaiju’s means of entry into our world had been destroyed, but the units still in existence following The War were kept in cold-storage in the event of Kaiju once again finding a way to our world. A treaty had been signed between all those nations either with Jaeger programs, or those actively supporting them, stating that a defensive pact be made ensuring that in the event of a Kaiju resurgence all international differences be put aside for the survival of the race.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in December of 2026 well over a dozen Kaiju emerged from the ocean on the East coast of America near Maine, far more than had ever been seen at one time. Without any warning the nations of the world were unable to mobilize their Jaegers before the Kaiju started laying waste to cities. Within 24 hours over 500,000 people were dead or missing. Then, an unidentified mech, totally unlike any of the Jaegers developed by any country with active programs, appeared seemingly out of nowhere. This machine’s weapons and defenses were entirely unlike anything developed in any known program; extremely adaptive and energy absorbent hull, and advanced energy weapons including particle beams, matter displacement arrays, high-explosive flechette rounds, and a monstrously powerful plasma weapon with an ordinance close to 8,000 kilotons and a range of several miles. This giant, although only around 50 meters tall as compared to Cherno Alpha or Coyote Tango’s 85 meters, put up one of the most one-sided fights we had ever seen against any Kaiju, let alone that many. The world stood in awe of this beast, easily the most advanced piece of weaponry known to mankind.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, America had met this machine nearly 70 years ago, in 1958. It had “gone rogue” in a small Maine town, laying waste to the large military detachment sent in response to its discovery, and was subsequently destroyed with nuclear ordinance. This was passed off as a test firing internationally. The re-emergence of the “Iron Giant”, as it had come to be called, was a massive shock to the US government. There was some belief that this was not the same machine, but a similar model, but upon dispatching the Kaiju it began asking for someone named “Hogarth”.  The name was tracked down to be Hogarth Hughes, a 77 year old man living in the same small town as the original “Iron Giant” encounter. Unfortunately, one of the earlier Kaiju attacks targeted this town and Hogarth was never found. Upon hearing this news the “Iron Giant” went into a rage and dove deep into the Atlantic off the coast of Maine. Probes sent to the newly opened portal reported seeing the machine entering it with all weapons active. 28 hours later the portal closed.</p>
<p>It has been nearly 30 years since the “Iron Giant” closed the portal, and not once has there been any sign of the Kaiju or their creators. </p>
<p>Wherever you are Iron Giant, the hearts of Humanity go out to you.</p>

And why would you want to? <em>Everyone</em> will be joining the Kingdom of Heaven, and of course people want to ascend as quickly as possible. These are the end times, but instead of the disaster that so many had predicted, it is a glorious reunion with God!"</p>
<p>"Think about what this means for anyone who chooses to stay, though! We've got people here blowing up planes and malls, and being honored as heroes! Just yesterday, my Secretary of the Interior murdered his entire family, then killed himself. It's a madhouse! Some people are not convinced, and they should not be taken against their will."</p>
<p>"What does any of that matter? Why would they <em>want</em> to stay? " the Pope said sharply. "They should welcome God's forgiveness despite their stubbornness. In fact, everyone should be taking such steps and trying to take the unfaithful to Heaven with them! The only reason that I and the rest of the Church have remained on Earth is to shepard the remaining non-believers into the Kingdom. We're even receiving masses of converts from the Middle East and China, pledging their faith just before killing themselves!"</p>
<p>"What if the scientists are wrong though? What if there was something off about their results?"</p>
<p>The pope scoffed audibly. </p>
<p>"Mr President, for <em>centuries</em>, the Church has endured the scorn of the scientific community. We have repeatedly tried to tell people to have faith that God will take care of them in the afterlife. Lately, it has gotten worse and worse! More and more 'miracles' being disproved by your scientific community, more and more of the Biblical story being disproven by archaeologists and historians..." The Pope's accent became thicker and thicker as he got angrier. "And <em>now</em> that we have science on our side, you're asking me if I'm <em>sure</em>? Now that we have had <em>multiple</em> people brought back from the dead and they described their experiences in Heaven? Now that we've even been able to communicate with the other side? <em>NOW</em> you ask me to doubt science? No, sir. I will continue my work on this Earth, and I hope that I am the last to go. I will not help you keep your citizens tethered to this mortal plane."</p>
<p>The phone clicked, and the president was left listening to the dial tone. First time anyone had hung up on him in years.</p>
<p>"God damn it," the President said, putting his elbows on the heavy wooden desk in the Oval Office and resting his forehead in his palms. "You're good. You really nailed it this time."</p>

<p>He thought of his children. They all had families of their own, and they were supposed to be visiting soon. He sighed.</p>
<p>No one knew he was sick. Ron knew, but he made him swear on his life not to tell anyone. He'd had a good life, and he wanted to go without a fuss. Enough close brushes with death had made him want to go quietly.</p>
<p>He wanted some tea, but he felt too weak to get up. He took out his wand, then stopped. He held the old, etched wood in his hands, then lightly made sparks fly out of the tip.</p>
<p>He smiled. He always loved how still, so many years later, magic still amazed him. </p>
<p>Suddenly, his scar hurt. </p>
<p>He wasn't alarmed by it, nor by the man who had appeared in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>It was Tom Riddle. Not snake-like, pale, and red-eyed. Human. He smiled, not menacingly, but warmly.</p>
<p>"Hello, Harry."</p>
<p>Harry smiled as well. "Nice to see you again, Tom."</p>
<p>"Is it nice? I was never much of a warm presence when I was among the living. I hurt many people. But most of all, I tried to hurt you. It's ironic that you were among the few who saw me as Tom Riddle, rather than Lord Voldemort."</p>

<p>Harry looked at him. There were tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I'm scared." he said.</p>
<p>"I know." said another voice.</p>
<p>Harry turned. It was Ginny. He gasped.</p>
<p>Behind her stood every person he had ever loved and lost. Hagrid, and Dumbledore, and  Dobby, and Lupin and Tonks and Snape and Cedric and Sirius and even the Dursleys. His parents stood next to Ginny, smiling. </p>
<p>"We're with you, Harry." his mother said softly.</p>
<p>Harry turned to Riddle.</p>
<p>Tom stuck out his hand. "Come, Harry."</p>

And not to mention the thousands and thousands of dollars worth of toys that had miraculously appeared under the Christmas tree last night. </p>
<p>"Did you win the lottery or something and not tell me?" Martin whispered to his wife. "Where did all of this come from?" They'd been scrimping and saving for <em>months</em> to buy Gary that new video game system that he wanted... and they'd still been about a hundred bucks short by the time Christmas came around. So they got him a new bike instead. But not the insanely expensive one that he'd unwrapped first; <em>that</em> had been a shock. </p>
<p>Nancy couldn't even answer. Her eyes were glistening and her smile wavered as Gary brought a present over to her: a slender box, wrapped in green-and-blue striped paper. "I asked Santa for something for you too, Mommy." Tears rolled down her cheeks as she accepted it and managed to thank her son. She opened the box to reveal a diamond necklace that would have looked at home around the Queen of England's neck. Her jaw dropped and she turned to Martin, who was also speechless.</p>
<p>"What's this, Mommy?" They managed to turn away from the sparkling diamonds for long enough to see what had come out of the very large box in the center of the room: some sort of... table.</p>
<p>It was made of glistening black stone that seemed to suck in light. There were deep scarlet candles lining the perimeter, and in the center there was a bone-white sheep's skull grinning back at them. Except the eyes were glowing red, like they were full of fire.</p>
<p>"Honey," Nancy said, dropping the diamond necklace and getting up from the couch as quickly as she could, "Don't touch that. You don't know wha..."</p>
<p>"Dear Gary," he read from a card, completely ignoring his mother's instructions. "I hope you ejn... enjoy all the presents. Just make sure to stad... stand at the table and read this incatnation... incantation when you're done, and we'll call it even." Gary squinted at the paper as his mother tried to tear it out of his hands. "Ut veinma pesreque..."</p>
<hr />
<p>"God damn it," Satan cursed, watching through the eyes of the sheep skull, "He's butchering it! I <em>knew</em> it wouldn't work!" He turned to the assembled demons behind him with flames shooting from his nostrils. "Whose fucking bright idea was it to have a <em>dyslexic</em> kid read the <em>Latin</em> summoning incantation?!"</p>

<p>EDIT: THERE IS NOW AN OFFICIAL SUBREDDIT TO DISCUSS THIS POST AND ITS EXPANSION INTO A FULLY FLEDGED NOVEL. /r/MattsWrittenWord IF YOU WISH TO BE KEPT UP TO DATE WITH THIS STORIES PRODUCTION PLEASE ENTER IT. </p>
<p>"Okay, that never happened in the first place, " I stated simply to the reaper invigilator. "Something is wrong in your base files because after a millenium of analysis and searching my memories I can tell you... that one never happened."</p>
<p>The reaper floated closer to me, it's black trench coat flapping slightly in the non existent breeze of my eternity-vault. I felt sorry for the reapers at times like this, I'd always been stubborn and it probably didn't deserve it. They were born at the same time as our souls were and tethered to us for the rest of eternity. They didn't want it, they didn't need it and the contract was ultimately binding. It was a good thing that my reaper and I got on, otherwise eternity would have been all kinds of messed up. </p>
<p>"It's probably part of an offshoot then, wouldn't be the first time time you've made that mistake," the reaper snarked, drifting over to my record banks. </p>
<p>"Not an offshoot, up top got really pissy last time I made that mistake, never again," I muttered shaking my head. "Look, right there, that kiss. I have full access to all my memories in here and I can tell you that one did not happen." </p>
<p>I would have liked it to though, that much both me and the reaper knew.  I'd studied the offshoot that one had spawned many times before. Love, fortune, joy and a distinctive lack of the money owed that lead to me... dying. It would have been a nice and long life, one of the happiest offshoots there had been. But it wasn't real, that much I knew.  </p>
<p>"You're right..." The reaper clarified, "that's new... that wasn't there the last time we scanned that segment... so how is it there now..."</p>
<p>We both floated in silence for a moment, staring at the erroneous piece of time line.  Nothing like this had happened to us before and the reaper had never heard of it happening to any of the other deads either. It was a perplexing quandary to say the least.</p>
<p>"I'm contacting head office now, keep an eye on your time line,  anything else changes you let me know straight away okay?" The reaper ordered before drawing the outline of a phone, the item materialising near instantly. Damn reapers and their matter manipulation talents, I wish I had matter manipulation abilities, all sorts of fun things could happen then.</p>
<p>I turned my eyes back to the time line,  tracing along from the new change. A heavy lump formed in my throat. The whole thing was twisting and cracking and splintering out of control. Offshoots replacing reality then melding the two together in a strange abomination of the two. </p>
<p>"Reap, my time line is going out of control, get someone in here right now," I ordered. He didnt reply but from the crack of energy behind me I knew the head honcho had showed up.</p>
<p>He wasn't God, he hadn't created humanity, rather the opposite. He was one of the first reapers and had been the one to sort out the department of reaping along with his Human. If it weren't for them our time lines would have been lost to the winds of time, and then what would we have spent eternity doing? </p>
<p>"This better not be another mistake Daniels," the head said, amusement tinting his tone. "By the gods..." he muttered as he drew closer and saw what was happening. </p>
<p>"Is it localised to him?" My Reaper asked and the head nodded in response. </p>
<p>"Someone from the living world is tampering with his time line,  they're trying to find an eventuality where he becomes immortal," the head explained,  his eyes flicking over the twisting lines. </p>
<p>"We never discovered anything like that during our analysis, and we've been here for over a millenia," I said, my voice incredulous. There was no way there was such a time line, and even if there was who would want me to live forever that badly?</p>
<p>"My Human and I have been in this realm for many more thousands of years Daniels, I can assure you that you haven't seen every possibility yet."</p>
<p>The world began to flicker in and out of my vision. I vaguely heard the head swear and my own reaper gasp in pain. They must have found it.  The one where I lived forever. For the first time since death I felt a little flutter of excitement. I was going back to the world of the living... I wonder if I will remember any of this.</p>

<h4>[WP] Superman is mentally handicapped. That's why he thinks nobody can pick up the Clark Kent=Superman thing, and everyone plays along in an effort to keep him from throwing a tantrum. The comics are his idea of what is going on. What does a day in Metropolis actually look like?</h4>
<p>Score: 2657</p>
<p>A scream from half-way across the city woke me up. Without even thinking, I knew where it was coming from - <em>her apartment.</em></p>
<p>I threw on my suit, and threw my super suit over my suit, and wearing both of my suits, I zooped out the window. </p>
<p>With a shattering <em>smack</em>, I crashed through <em>her</em> window. It probably looked really cool when I did that.</p>
<p>There was a man in her bedroom, a <em>naked</em> man, and even though he didn't have a weapon, I could tell he was about to attack her. How could I tell? Because when I burst into her room, she screamed out loud, and said, "Oh no, not again!"</p>
<p>Lois is always getting attacked. That's why she needs me.</p>
<p>But I don't want her to know who I am, so before she could see me, I dashed into her closet, and took off my super suit. I walked out of her bedroom closet, carrying my briefcase, and wearing my glasses, and not even <em>she</em> realized that I was the same person who had just flown through her window.</p>
<p>I pretended to be surprised to see her, "Oh, Lois, <em>you're</em> here?" </p>
<p>She was completely fooled. I could tell by the shock in her eyes - her mouth was an open 'O'. It's easy to trick people when you're Superman.</p>
<p>"Who the hell are you?" the attacker said. He wasn't wearing any clothes, but even in that disguise, I could tell who he <em>really</em> was.</p>
<p>"You don't fool me, Joker!" </p>
<p>I pulled back my fist, and I almost punched him, when I remembered that I was still wearing my Clark uniform. Whew. Close.</p>
<p>I jumped back into the closet, and put on my super suit again, and jumped back out.</p>
<p>By now, Lois was standing in front of the man (she was also naked, but she had a sheet wrapped around her, but she doesn't know that I can see through clothes. I do it all the time. I was doing it then, too. Hehe.)</p>
<p>I guess she was confused because even though I was in my super suit, she said, "Clark - <em>don't.</em>"</p>
<p>"I'm not Clark," I said, "I mean - who is Clark? I am Superman!"</p>
<p>That cleared it up for her. Now she understood that I was Superman, and not Clark. She still doesn't know that I'm <em>both</em>.</p>
<p>"Fine. <em>Superman,</em> get out of here, <em>now.</em>"</p>
<p>She sounded angry, but that was probably because she was being attacked by the Joker. The Joker is a scary guy, because he's always laughing, even when nothing is funny, and that's pretty scary.</p>
<p>I said, "First, I must save you!" and before the Joker could escape like he always does, I threw my arms around him, and crushed him to my chest.</p>
<p>"SUPERMAN!" she shrieked. At first, I thought she was going to <em>finally</em> tell me what a hero I was, and thank me for saving her, and kiss me, and invite me to -</p>
<p>"DON'T YOU DARE HURT HIM."</p>
<p>Now <em>I</em> was confused. Did she <em>not</em> want me to kill the Joker, and finally rid the city of this horrible, blood-thirsty menace?</p>
<p>"PUT HIM DOWN, NOW."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see," I said. Lois was a gentle soul. She would never hurt a fly. I don't usually hurt flies either, but sometimes they buzz around my Sprite cans, so I have to zap them out of the air. Anyway, she didn't want me to hurt him, so I said, "Alright, if that's how you want it. I will take him to - <em>Arkham Asylum!</em>"</p>
<p>Nobody ever plays dramatic music when I say that, so I had to add it in myself. I sang, "<em>Dun dun DUNNNNN,</em>" and you could feel the excitement building.</p>
<p>With the Joker in my arms, I jumped out of the window, flew down to Arkham, and shoved him into the darkest, smelliest cell I could find.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lois ran out of the lobby, praying to herself that Tim was alright. Out on the street, she whipped her head around, looking for any sign of him - or of Clark.</p>
<p>A groan echoed out of the alley.</p>
<p>She rushed around the building - to the dumpster - and found Tim crumpled inside, peeling sticky pieces of trash off of his skin.</p>
<p>"Oh, God, Tim. I'm so, <em>so</em> sorry. I told you he was ..." she let the sentence trail off.</p>
<p>"Lois," he groaned, "Have you ever thought about moving?"</p>
<p>"Tried it. Last time I went to Paris, he tore apart the whole airplane to 'save me from 'Lex Luthor's Evil Machines.' Look, next time we're... next time, I'll keep some broccoli laying around."</p>
<p>Tim gave her an incredulous look. The page of a magazine slid down his cheek and fell with a moist <em>plop</em>. </p>
<p>"He thinks vegetables are poison," she explained, "Anything green and leafy he calls 'Kryptonite'."</p>

<p>Score: 2656</p>
<p>"There was also a summer I worked at a hot dog stand, during high school," Obama said. "It was voluntary work, 
but I think it really helped me improve my people skills."</p>
<p>The manager looked up from the eighty page resume. "Uh-huh…"</p>
<p>"I can produce a recommendation letter from my last job too, if it's necessary."</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Presi – Mr. Obama, I don't think… So you really wanna work at Target?"</p>
<p>Obama smiled. "Yes, I think it'll be a nice change."</p>
<p>"All righty, then," the manager said, stamping Obama's resume with a green 'HIRED'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Second aisle to your left."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Obama!"</p>
<p>The mother and child walked away with smiles on their faces. Obama smiled too. He looked down at the tag on his 
uniform, reading BARACK. The manager wanted Mr. Obama, but Obama insisted on the first name. All he wanted 
was a quiet life now, as a quiet employee of a supermarket, with a quiet first name. No more Mr. Presidents, no 
meetings to discuss the future of the world…</p>
<p>"Hey, Obama!" Mike greeted him on his way to the cashiers.</p>
<p>"Mike! Come here." </p>
<p>Mike stopped and turned around. "What's up?"</p>
<p>"Listen, is there a way we can put the cereal and milk closer together?" Obama looked beyond Mike at the mother 
and child walking away. "That woman was like the third customer today trying to find both. They're five aisles apart, but most people buy them together."</p>
<p>Mike scratched his head. "You'd have to talk to Lester, in Logistics. But – uh – it won't be easy."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, you work Customers, Obama. Logistics people and Customers don't usually get along very well."</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"Meh, the whole issue has been going on for years. You're not the first one to try and bring up ideas to help the 
customers. Logistics and Business always seem to think they know best."</p>
<p>Obama smiled innocently. "That's silly. Where's this Lester's office? I'll talk to him."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you think?" Obama asked.</p>
<p>Lester shook his head in a sarcastic smile. "You people from Customers… you always think you have the answers. Do you have any idea what it's like behind the scenes? The trouble we go through to organize the shelves, bring the supplies? The trouble Business goes through to price everything right?"</p>
<p>"I'm just saying that maybe if we put the cereal and the milk closer together, the customer won't have to –"</p>
<p>"Oh, you guys are always thinking of the customer. Customer this, customer that. Cashiers are the same way. You 
know, sometimes you have to let the customer do the work for themselves. Target can't keep offering a hand to 
anyone who can't stand on their own two feet. If someone can't find the milk and the cereal, maybe they don't 
deserve it. Maybe they didn't look hard enough."</p>
<p>"But it's really no big deal, I'm just suggesting that –"</p>
<p>"Sorry, Obama. We have other priorities for our budget. That's a no."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Told you," Mike said, later, as they made way back from their lunch break. "You'll have a hard time trying to get 
Logistics and Business to back any of your ideas."</p>
<p>"Can't you help me?"</p>
<p>"I work Cashiers, they hate us more than they hate you… always complaining we're soft-hearted fools who don't 
think about the business side, who only want to help the customers…"</p>
<p>"Jesus…" Obama stopped by the store entrance. "So there's nothing we can do?"</p>
<p>"Well… Marketing has a lot of influence with Logistics and Business," Mike said, by the door. "Maybe if you establish 
an alliance with them…"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So you're proposing…"</p>
<p>"That you cut the budget from Marketing for a couple of months, so we can use it to back up the rearrangement of 
the milk and cereal displays," Obama said. "If we see an increase in sales after this time, we'll pass one hundred percent of Cheerios profit to you guys, for a period no longer than a year."</p>
<p>"And if you don't?"</p>
<p>"We go back to the way it was before and establish a fair time frame to pay you back, with interests."</p>
<p>Jonathan from Marketing bit his lips. "Logistics and Business won't like this."</p>
<p>"Yes, but you can turn them around," Obama said. "Can't you?"</p>
<p>Jonathan paused. Then offered his hand. "I'll draft a contract."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is a nightmare!" Mike grunted, eyes fixed on the paper. "It's been three months and nothing!"</p>
<p>"We have one more month in our deal with Marketing," Obama said.</p>
<p>"Do you realize Finance had to cut the price of Cheerios AND two percent milk THREE times already, because of the 
drop in demand?"</p>
<p>"It'll catch up. People are just not used to having them displayed closer together."</p>
<p>"Obama, people are confused. They were used to having milk on aisle five and cereals on aisle one. Now that cereals 
are on aisle two, they don't even bother to look! They're just buying eggs for breakfast and calling it a day!"</p>
<p>Obama sighed. "Well, that's because Logistics and Business set those restriction rules which were <em>not</em> in my 
original deal with Marketing! Milk and cereals were supposed to be side by side, not an aisle apart!"</p>
<p>"It was a compromise, Obama."</p>
<p>"A compromise my ass! Logistics knew that amendment would kill my whole project!"</p>
<p>Lester from Logistics passed by them, locking eyes on Obama. A smile sprouted between his lips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The market's crashed," Jonathan said, as soon as Obama walked in the room. "Obama, this is Will, from Finances."</p>
<p>Will, a fat man in a suit, offered Obama his hand. "We need to act fast. The Cheerio price is dropping like gravity. 
The price is half of what it was last month, and people still aren't buying."</p>
<p>"What about the milk?"</p>
<p>"It's going bad on the shelves. We can't go on like this, Obama."</p>
<p>Obama shook his head, defeated. "All right. Call Logistics, tell them starting tomorrow we'll have milk and cereals in the original aisles again."</p>
<p>"We did that already, Obama," Will said. "I'm afraid it's not enough."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Jonathan and Will exchanged looks. "We're going to have a meeting with Cashiers and Customers tonight."</p>
<p>"Cashiers and Customers? What about?"</p>
<p>"Well, Business and Logistics are blaming you for the Cheerios crash. Now, Mike in Cashiers tells me you had to 
settle for one aisle apart, when the original plan was having them in the same aisle."</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"Maybe your original plan would work, but it's too late now. We have Cheerios representatives knocking on our 
door every day, consumers complaining they can't find the milk and, when they do, it's all gone bad… I'm afraid 
drastic measures must be taken, Obama."</p>
<p>Obama looked from Will to Jonathan. They were serious like death.</p>
<p>"What do you mean drastic measures?"</p>
<p>"We can't afford to have Cheerios pull their product from our stores, Obama. We're establishing a bailout plan for the milk and cereals. The money will have to come from the consumer."</p>
<p>"Oh, for fuck's sake."</p>

<p>Score: 2646</p>
<p>"<em>I</em> never said she stole my money. Tina's the one who said that."</p>
<p>We were seated at the police station, across from a very frazzled looking officer. My friend Tina replies:</p>
<p>"Bullshit, Jo, you told me last week it was her!"</p>
<p>"No, that's not true. I <em>never</em> said she stole my money."</p>
<p>"You called her a 'dirty rotten thief.'"</p>
<p>"Right. But still. I never <em>said</em> she stole my money. I only implied she stole something from me."</p>
<p>"But then later you said that $50 was missing from your purse!"</p>
<p>"That's also true, but I wasn't talking about her. I never said <em>she</em> stole my money."</p>
<p>"Jo, stop fucking around. You said she owed you hundreds of dollars."</p>
<p>"Right again, Tina, but wrong again in the implications you've drawn. I never said she <em>stole</em> my money. Just that she borrowed it and never paid it back."</p>
<p>"So how is she a thief?"</p>
<p>"Well, I never said she stole <em>my</em> money, but when we used to work together, she got fired for stealing from my boss. And, I never said she stole my <em>money</em>. But she did walk out of my house with my favorite vase after a New Years Eve party. Weirdest thing, too, <em>she</em> came up to me to give me a hug with it under her shirt. . ."</p>
<p>The frazzled looking detective dropped dead in his chair. An autopsy would show that he died of a spontaneous brain aneurysm.</p>
<p>The moral is that you can fit all permutations of the sentence "I never said she stole my money" into one story. But it will probably sound so confusing and contrived that one of your secondary characters may die of pure bemusement.</p>

<h4>[WP] A new invention enables people to remember their dreams with absolute clarity. It turns out we were forgetting them for a very good reason.</h4>
<p>Score: 2644</p>
<p>My name is Liam and It's been four months since I last dreamed.<br />
A lot of people set their alarms to wake up throughout the night, sleeping in half hour bursts, other people sleep in shifts, watching each other.  I take Myclocin.  Dreamless sleep.  I have a good job and make good money so I get the pills.  Others, aren't so lucky.  </p>
<p>Last year some Chinese company invented a machine that lets you remember dreams with total clarity.  I mean down to the details man.  No ambiguity, crystal clear memories of amazing landscapes and experiences.<br />
It became THE Christmas gift.  Then you could record your dreams and upload them to youtube.  And that's when things started to fall apart, that's when we started to notice them.</p>
<p>We'd never noticed them before.  I think it's because in your dreams you're always focused on the doing.  Taking that exam, driving that car, fucking that girl.  We've never really paused and looked around the same way you might do on a Sunday morning walk.  But they were there, they'd always been there, standing in the background, silently watching us.  Holes instead of eyes, long fingers, teeth...fuck, so many teeth.</p>
<p>Maybe we did notice them thousands of years ago, way back when we were still lived in caves, maybe that's where our Gods and monsters came from.  Maybe we evolved to forget them, muddled dreams gave them a camouflage to hide behind.  But not any more.  We saw them standing in the background and edges in our dreams and everyone else's.  I thought it was one of those internet memes at first, like slenderman or something.  People with too much time on their hands photoshopping their dreams for cheap likes and shares.</p>
<p>But they were real, and when we finally noticed them they started to notice us.  They stepped out of the peripheral, reached out with those long, grey, cold fingers and....took people.</p>
<p>I know we won't last, we can't fight them, turning off the machines did nothing.  People queued, fucking queued up in lines on the edges of buildings and bridges like they were waiting for a bus to come and take them away.  Instead they jumped, the roads and canals were full of red-black carnage every morning.  </p>
<p>So we don't dream.  We wake each other up, or we take turns, we drink coffee like it was water, we inject, we pop pills, anything to stop us from dreaming.</p>
<p>But it hasn't worked, I can feel my mind unraveling like so many others before me.  I need to get some natural sleep.  I need to dream.  But I don't dare.  I'd gladly give up food and water if I could dream and give my brain what it needs.  Instead I stare into my computer screen trying to remember what I was trying to do.  I don't trust myself behind the wheel of my car.  I walk everywhere now, a stumbling, mindless walk like everyone else.<br />
We look like a zombie apocalypse shuffling from place to place.</p>
<p>People have started to hallucinate.  Not so much from sleep deprivation but dream deprivation, and some people just...snap.  Some old lady in town just went for it out of the blue, no one was shocked.  We watched her run into the street screaming, desperately trying to get hit by a car.  She'd managed to gouge out one of her eyes before she was hit.  Fuck knows what she was seeing.  I helped drag her out of the road, her mashed up eye in one clawed hand.  We said nothing.</p>
<p>The hallucinations are bad but what's worse is...I think They can...I think They're starting to come through now into the real world.  I guess any dream is enough for them, even a hallucination.</p>
<p>I saw the first two this morning.  Behind me in the bathroom mirror while I was brushing my teeth, two long-limbed pale faced...things.  Watching me with those holes instead of eyes.  Yawning mouths full of needle thin teeth.</p>
<p>Four months to get to this point.  And I just can't let them take me.  But I can't go on.  </p>
<p>The line is efficient.  We shuffle forwards.  Some people scream on the way down, most don't.  I think it's because they're happy.  Happy to finally sleep without dreams.</p>

<h4><a href="NSFW">WP</a> The world has moved on from nature documentaries, leaving many narrators out of a job. These men and women turn to a new field; narrating pornography.</h4>
<p>Score: 2633</p>
<p>Human mating, once a thing of beauty and mystery, has been reduced to a science by these clever experts. Like the majestic bird of paradise, the seduction ritual follows very clear and often complicated steps, depending on the particular variety. Our subject today is the common "Lemon-stealing whore." Though she adopts a somewhat unusual strategy, her tactics are quite successful. Let's watch!</p>
<p>The ritual begins not with an attempt to show off her ample busom or other physical features, as one might expect. This unusual adaptation seems to have evolved due to an over-saturation of competition from other women with more appealing aesthetics. The LSW instead gains attention by rather brusquely entering the male's territory and attempting to pilfer food directly from the male's home. The instinctive defense mechanism kicks in, allowing the Whore to bypass the complicated ritual attempting to gain the man's attention. This clever young lady has no need for such deceptive practices as 'hiring a plumber' or 'ordering a pizza.' She draws the male directly to her by threatening its food source! Ingenious!</p>
<p>Once the male has been sufficiently placated and the food returned, the female <em>then</em> attempts to turn the male's attention to more sexual acts. The male, with his naturally short attention span, completely forgets all about her past indiscretions in attempting to rob him of his sour citrus treasures, and willingly consents to copulation. From this point onward, it is up to the female to <em>maintain</em> his attention and bring him to coitus. The LSW does this through the use of a variety of sexual positions, exaggerated moaning, and contorted facial expressions in an attempt to trick the male into believing that she's really enjoying it.</p>
<p>At long last, the act is almost completed. Now comes the most difficult challenge for the LSW: the male will attempt to perform a maneuver known as 'pulling out,' so that he can avoid impregnating the female and thus keep all of the lemons for himself. The male will, however, attempt to 'claim' the woman as part of his harem by marking her face with his seed. This is a compromise result for the two, as the LSW is at least assured that he will attempt to copulate in the future. Let's see if she can manage to... Oh! So close! She didn't quite manage to keep him inside of her for long enough, and he has now established ownership of her with this 'cumshot' signature.</p>
<p>But alas, that is the way of cruel nature. At least we can rest assured knowing that she has gotten further than most females, and his sperm on her face is a promise that she can try again tomorrow!</p>
<p>I hope you all have enjoyed this tremendous display of erotic acrobatics, and I sincerely hope that you will tune in tomorrow for our special on the flock-like nature of the bukkake participant!</p>

<p>"Sir, he's done it again," Crispin Carter looked nervous, and by well he should. The man he stood by, an unassuming middle-aged bachelor, streaks of grey running through his hair, well tailored wool suit fitted against his broad back, was known only by his title. He was the Punisher, able to inflict physical pain on whoever he wanted solely by the use of a couple of choice words. </p>
<p>"Take me to his cell," the Punisher spoke sparingly. </p>
<p>It was a tiny dank hole, only measuring two by three metres. The ceiling was so low that Crispin Carter had to stoop to get inside. On one side, the wall stood smashed in. A gap in the bricks showed the person who escaped couldn't have been any more than four feet high.</p>
<p>The Punisher stroked one fingertip against the grey cell walls, sniffing the dusty residue that remained. </p>
<p>"You say he could communicate with the dead?" He said quietly and Crispin nodded. </p>
<p>"And you didn't put him under any special security?" The Punisher's fist clenched and he slammed it into the cell wall. </p>
<p>Crispin gulped. The Punisher had a fearsome temper. He backed away from him, worried that at any moment something would emerge from his mouth.... </p>
<p>The Punisher advanced on him. </p>
<p>"You put no extra protection on this fearsome criminal?" He said again</p>
<p>"Sir, he's three foot eleven!" Crispin protested. </p>
<p>The Punisher scowled. He glowered at Crispin. </p>
<p>"Well," he said slowly. "Looks like we have a small medium at large," </p>
<p>Crispin's screams echoed in his ears as he stalked away. </p>

<p>On top of the warehouse, the words 'WRITING PROMPTS HEADQUARTERS' tower over our heads. We make way 
down the street and walk in.</p>
<p>The inside of the warehouse is a huge, wide-open space, like I expected it to be. To my left and right, small, wooden doors with prompt titles written in neon on top announce the latest posts.</p>
<p>"Where are we going, exactly?" I ask, looking left and right, worried.</p>
<p>"We're going to find this prompt", the hitman says. "The one we are in."</p>
<p>"So you can kill me there, right?" I ask, already resigned to my fate.</p>
<p>'<em>Fate</em>'.</p>
<p>"Dude, would you –", the hitman stops, taking a deep breath. He looks somewhere behind me, all of a sudden. 
"There!" he says. "Found it."</p>
<p>I look back to find a door just like the others, topped by a sign in neon that reads 'Foreshadow the character's

<p>"What about them?" I ask, confused.</p>
<p>"This prompt was not your idea, bro", the hitman says. ”It's not you I'm after."</p>
<p>I frown, and I think about that for a second. Then the hitman takes a knife from his pocket and turns his back to me.</p>

<p>As I pulled the trigger, my last memories were of the life I'd built and the fragile manner in which it had crumpled up in front of me, torn to pieces like a dried leaf.</p>
<p>For what seemed like eons, I found the inner peace I had longed after. Like everything else I held dear, however, this was soon taken away by a flash of red. I felt my eyes open, and felt miles of heat and pulsing infernal light flow into them. I was lying on a field of crimson, surrounded by pools of lava, sprawling spires of brimstone reaching towards a ceiling that seemed limitless, yet came to an end at several nearby caves. The dark light pounding at my senses, I had not noticed the shadow standing over me.</p>
<p>"Hello," a deep voice called, concise and clear yet seemingly distorted by darkness and suffering. "I've been expecting you."</p>
<p>I was not expecting this.</p>
<p>"Are... are you? Please, this is not happening..."</p>
<p>"Yes. I am the devil. You may call me Satan, if it brings you an ounce of satisfaction that you'll soon be devoid of."</p>
<p>Satan appeared to have no appearance. A veil of darkness floated where he stood, concealing whatever horrors he did not yet wish to unleash. Or far more terrifying, <em>could not</em>.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" The void inquired.</p>
<p>Falling to my knees, my head began to pound as I began to sob out the words. </p>
<p>"Damn, I was hoping you wouldn't be such a downer."</p>
<p>Wait... did he just...</p>

<p>"I said," Satan snapped, sounding surprisingly sarcastic, "Your pathetic attitude is bringing me sorrow. Which disappoints me, considering you're the only company I've ever had."</p>
<p>"You... you're telling me I'm the only one here?" I glanced around, observing only potential suffering and noting a stark absence of kinetic suffering.</p>
<p>I lurched backwards in a sudden outburst of fear and confusion. "I'm the sole sinner ever so consumed to deserve this place? No man, woman, or child has committed themselves to deeds more dreadful than mine?" </p>
<p>I felt my fear replaced by anger. "All I did was for my home, for my people!"</p>
<p>A sense of defeat filled the deepest recesses of my core, interbreeding with rage to create something wholly pathetic and vicious in equal measure. </p>
<p>"I see now." I stared hard into where Satan's eyes should've been. "I'm here because I took the easy way. Because after all I've suffered, I took my own life rather than let others snatch it from me. Because I acted on the last shred of dignity I possessed, the last infinitesimal speck of humanity I had, God and you alike have forever damned me to suffer further?"</p>

<p>Score: 2539</p>
<p>I broke my fixation on the woefully empty bottle of beer to glance down at my phone as it <em>dinged</em>, notifying me about an email. I sighed. Debt collectors and spam. That's all I ever got anymore. At least the latter allowed me the pleasure of pressing the fun little trashcan icon. </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change...</strong>, the preview of the subject read. Hell, yeah. I would give anything to change everything right now. My girlfriend was gone on some escapade with her not-so-secret lover, my student loan debt was three times what I made in a year, pre-taxes, the eviction notice was still taped to the door... I hadn't been too broke to buy beer since college, but here I was. Same old.</p>
<p>I swiped right and typed in the double 69 password; a relic from more cheerful times. The email was short and to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very hard.</strong> Seemed about as legit as the Nigerian prince my grandpa was always helping out. My finger hovered over the trashcan icon but my phone <em>dinged</em> again, the echo bouncing off the walls of the nearly empty room. A text this time with the same message and a simple instruction: <strong>Reply YES for details</strong>. I shrugged and typed the message, arching my eyebrows skeptically as the message <em>whooshed</em> away and I turned back to the bottle hoping to leach out a couple more drops.</p>
<p><strong>Pick your level: First World Problems, Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard</strong>. I sighed. Whoever this was, they were persistent. A cruel joke, most likely. Getting my hopes up that my life could be anything more than a miserable shit hole. I chose the first option and hit send, shrugging in mild irritation before sighing and heading to my bed. Without the electric bills paid and nothing to entertain me, I was sleeping by dusk, my schedule more Amish than an Ohioan's. My phone rang a moment later, just as I was settling in and starting to tell myself a bedtime story.</p>
<p>"Mom?" I said hesitantly, surprised that she would call after six months of not talking to me. She let out a muffled sob and I sat up in my bed. "What happened?"</p>
<p>"It's dad..." she stuttered as she struggled to catch her breath. I frowned. My dad had been getting cigarettes since '95 and if he was suddenly showing up now, I wanted nothing to do with him. "Your grandfather passed away," she said quietly and I scowled. Disrupting my 8 o'clock bedtime for this? The man was a grade A dumbass and had provided more for random hookers than he had for me.</p>
<p>"I... I'm sorry," I managed to say half-heartedly.</p>
<p>"You barely knew him," she answered softly. "I can't see what he saw, but he must have thought very highly of you. He left you his fortune and the house by the lake. You're rich..." she said mournfully and I quietly gulped as I tried to fathom the idea.</p>
<p>"Goddammit," I sighed knocking my head against the headboard of the bed. "I'm gonna have a shit ton of taxes to do."</p>

<h4>[WP] A world class contract killer finds an envelope at his dead drop. Inside are $23.42 in small change and a letter hand-written by a 9-year-old girl.</h4>
<p>Score: 2539</p>
<p>The day he opened the box was the day his carefully woven lifestyle had fallen apart. He remembered it like yesterday, thinking back to that little purple package, tied with a bow and delivered to his door like he was being sent cookies. He recalled with a wry smile and a sigh how easily the rules he'd built had come crashing down. </p>
<hr />
<p>"Two." </p>
<p>"Two!? I'd been told it was one...y-you sure?"</p>
<p>"You were misinformed. The price is two." </p>
<p>"Two hundred grand? You better be good."</p>
<p>The man laughed into the receiver, a deep chuckle that died softly almost as soon as it had begun.</p>
<p>"I'm the <em>best</em>."</p>
<p>Rule one: Don't ever sell yourself cheap. </p>
<p>Another day, another phonecall. The man shook his head as he hung up the payphone. He liked to take calls at payphones - in an age of convenience and, more importantly, surveillance, a payphone was an innocuous choice and it meant people were rarely late. If he told them to call <em>x</em> payphone at <em>n</em> time, they'd call. Rule two: Be careful and precise.</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette in the phonebooth, dark sunglasses letting him observe the crowds rushing around the busy city centre. To him, they looked like ants, scurrying around with their busy lives. To him, any normal life was a thing to be observed, critiqued, mocked. </p>
<p>His own life was far simpler. Or more complex, depending on the angle you viewed it from. His working life was about completion. His targets and bonuses were around one goal. His 9-5 about training, stalking, executing. Rule three: Research and know your target. </p>
<p>His business was death, and business was good.</p>
<p>The hitman had been doing this for a long time. Long enough to know there is a price on every man's head. Long enough to know that no one dies for free. Long enough to be the best, or one of them. Which meant, of course, his price was high. Two hundred thousand dollars a hit, rising in doubles for riskier or higher profile targets. </p>
<p>He had killed doctors, lawyers, lovers, fighters, escorts, strippers, judges, policemen, politicians, leaders. One thing was the same. He had never killed a man for less than his price. <em>At least</em>, he thought, <em>not since the first.</em>  </p>
<p>He'd been an ex-military washout, desperate for work. He'd looked everywhere, travelling state to state in an attempt to pick up jobs as a security guard or bodyguard. Overnight stays in shanty towns and campsites, rubbing shoulders with the homeless and the degenerate. Things had gotten desperate, and a man had tried to take his food. That was his first kill. He'd gotten him in his sleep. No one suspected a thing. Another man had been his rival, and paid the hitman a hundred dollars. That was his first hit, and ever since his price had been high. </p>
<p>Then he'd found it. </p>
<p>It was simple really. Laughably so. On one of his many properties there was a small purple box wrapped like a cartoon gift, a pink ribbon bow tied around the top. Left on the doorstep of the back porch. At first, the hitman had been tempted to throw it away. It could have been a bomb, a deterrent, a threat. Anything. </p>
<p>But for some reason, some insane reason, he'd taken it inside. </p>
<p>He couldn't have told you why. He couldn't have told himself why. The obscenely cutesy gift, a child-like idea of what a gift should look like. It sat on his metallic table worktop, garishly out of place amongst the guns and knives littered in his apartment. </p>
<p>He'd opened it after some consideration, his fingers neatly undoing the bow and chuckling at the care someone had put into this. Perhaps it was because he'd never received a gift, merely saw them in cartoons. Perhaps it was the feeling it gave him: an excited, giddy rise in his belly that threatened to compromise everything he'd worked so hard to contain.</p>
<p>Inside had been a note, handwritten in the untidy scrawlings of a child. Alongside the note was a crumpled ten dollar bill and coins. He added them up slowly. They totalled $13.42. Added to the scruffy bill that was just over twenty dollars. He laid out the money on the table and turned back to the note.</p>
<p><em>Mister</em> It said.
<em>I think you can help me i have a problem and i think you can help me</em>
The hitman looked around, his empty apartment chilly. He almost felt embarrassed to be reading the note. It was as if eyes were on him, knowing his lizard-like slits should not be cast across something as innocent as a child's note. Almost guiltily, he continued.
<em>My daddy is a bad man. He hurts my mommy and he hurts me some nights he comes in my room and he tells me he loves me and hurts me in the bad way. mommy cries alot. she tells me well run away but then he always comes back.</em></p>
<p><em>Mister. I live near you and ive seen you soemtimes. i know u hide but ive seen your guns.</em></p>
<p><em>Please mister. I saved all my money that mommy tries to give me. my daddy takes it away to buy more bottles but i hided some.</em> </p>
<p><em>Please mister my daddy needs to go away. he says he is gonna kill my mommy and ill be his new woman when i growed up. he says hes gonna put a baby in me but thats silly im a kid i cant have a baby. i dont want a baby mister.</em></p>
<p><em>here is all my money mister. i know you make people disappereah. please make my daddy disappere.</em></p>
<p><em>we live at 31 Oakfelt drive, autumn boulevard. daddy comes home late every night and works in the city. he is a teacher.</em></p>
<p>The hitman put the letter down, blinking back tears. He traced the lazy scrawl of the girls handwriting with the tip of his finger, imagining her writing it. Desperate, rushed. It would have been neater, he could tell, if she'd not been so afraid. The dots were absent, the curvature of her writing tilted right down as though she'd been writing flat-out. Against the clock, sort to speak. </p>
<p>She was against the clock, he understood that. She was probably waiting for him to visit her room again, her tiny body shaking in fear as she wrote this plea to him. </p>
<p>He shook his head, sitting down on his leather sofa. It had cost him ten thousand dollars, that sofa. A luxury easily afforded due to his rules. Rule one: Don't sell yourself cheap. A life was worth two hundred grand, minimum. </p>
<p>He thought of her letter. He picked it back up and looked at it for a long time, staring at the foot of the page. </p>
<p><em>Love from Melissa.</em></p>
<p><em>P.s dont worry i wont tell. i dont want a daddy anyway. daddys are mean</em></p>
<p>The hitman found his fist clenching, the paper crumpling in his hand. Tears gathered in his face and he stared at the last few words, hastily scribbled out by the girl. He noticed dark blotches on the paper, where tears had fallen and been stained forever into the sheet.</p>
<p>He thought back to his own father, a ghost of a man who was neither here nor there, ever-scornful and frightening but so often absent that the man had grown old thinking his father might have been imagined, rather than real.</p>
<p>He thought back to this desperate little girl, scrounging scraps of change to try and pay him. </p>
<p>Rule number one: Don't sell yourself cheap. </p>
<p>A kill might have been worth two hundred grand to the hitman he thought to himself. But, as he sat and read the note one last time, <em>some kills are worth more than money.</em></p>
<p>No more rule number one. This time, the job cost $23.42. This time, the job would be worth that young girl's life. </p>

<h4>[WP] When teenagers turn 17, they are sent a slip of paper with their future occupation written on it. Yours says, "Princeps de Nova Roma" or "First Citizen of New Rome."</h4>
<p>Score: 2521</p>
<p>I had no outstanding qualifications.</p>
<p>I wasn’t the strongest (that was Gard), and I most certainly wasn’t the most clever (that would be Art). I wasn’t the most popular (Priya), I wasn’t the wisest (Edem), I wasn’t the most enduring (Martin), and I definitely wasn’t the most charismatic (Yennefer). </p>
<p>As far as I could tell, I had nothing going for me—but the Senate disagreed.</p>
<p>And on September 17th, 104 A.E., I got the slip that would call me Prime of our new world.</p>
<p>They told me the training would last ten years.</p>
<hr />
<p>“<em>Shit!</em>” I cried. That last one hurt. “Why does the Princeps have to do this, anyway?”</p>
<p>My first tutor was a stern man named Abattoir Singh, bald to his crown, with wrinkles so deep they looked like scars—or scars so deep they looked like wrinkles. It was difficult to tell.</p>
<p>He rapped the back of my knees with his staff and brought me to the floor.</p>
<p>“How can you hope to rule over Nova Roma if you cannot rule your own body?”</p>
<p>I tried getting up and he lashed out again. “<em>Shit!</em>”</p>
<p>“Watch your tongue, boy.” He rested the staff on his shoulder and gave me a squint. “If you suffer you must do it in <em>silence.</em> Anything more is weakness.”</p>
<p>I grit my teeth and tried to stand, and he got me in the nerve cluster in my thigh.</p>
<p>I swallowed a cry of pain and said, “You know who’d really like this? Gard Inura. Strongest guy I know.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps I’ll make an appeal to bring <em>him</em> here instead. For now I’ll have to do with you.”</p>
<p>Another hit, this time to the gut.</p>
<hr />
<p>My second tutor went by the title of Mind Above.</p>
<p>Nobody knew his real name, as far as I could tell.</p>
<p>I thought I’d be sitting in a stuffy classroom and going over old histories with him, but the very first day he put a wooden sculpture on my desk, all knotted and pieced together in complex twists and turns, and he told me: “Take this apart.”</p>
<p>Then he sat quietly at his desk. </p>
<p>I tried removing a section and sliding out a branch of wood, but that just made taking out the other side impossible. I tried sliding it to the middle and wriggling free the metal stopper at a crossbar, but then I couldn’t slide the piece free right below.</p>
<p>“This is pretty hard,” I said to him.</p>
<p>He stayed silent.</p>
<p>“There’s a person named Art Grimaldi who would have a field day with this.”</p>
<p>He stayed silent.</p>
<p>After about an hour I tried wrenching some of the wood pieces free, looking for the weakest seams.</p>
<p>He called from his desk absentmindedly, “This is a test of intelligence, not strength…”</p>
<p>I turned my eye back on the puzzle. This was going to take a while. </p>
<hr />
<p>I had five other tutors. </p>
<p>Old Graeme, who taught me History, Forktongue Creak, who taught me diplomacy, Builder Bronn, who taught me fine construction, Wireful Lin, who taught me the sciences, and last but not least, Stone George.</p>
<p>I didn’t know <em>what</em> he was supposed to teach me.</p>
<p>When I entered his classroom he didn’t acknowledge me. He simply sat in his cross-legged pose like a statue, and burned a hole into the wall with his stare.</p>
<p>I sat across from him, eager for whatever trick he had in store for me.</p>
<p>Surely this was some test of patience, so I sat and I waited.</p>
<p>After a half hour of fidgeting I asked, “So, what exactly are we meant to do here?”</p>
<p>No response, so we sat some more. </p>
<p>Another hour passed. I wasn’t allowed to leave the presence of a tutor until he dismissed me, so I stayed and I sat, leaned against a pillow and picked at the threads. </p>
<p>Another hour. </p>
<p>And then he finally spoke, like gravel on gravel.</p>
<p>“For breakfast you ate a meal of pease and porridge, you then went for a sparring match with Tutor Singh, before resting in the grove of the Tree of the World. For lunch you visited the cart of Anjali Leyeron, before walking up the long trail around Edd Creek before arriving in my home.”</p>
<p>I was stunned.</p>
<p>All of that, to a tee… was correct. “How did you know all that?”</p>
<p>“I sat silent and paid attention to the story written upon you, your clothes, your body.” His eyes flicked down for a moment. “Your boots were caked in dirt of three parts: the first layer from the fighting sands, the second from the soft earth of the planter’s gardens, the third from the rocky trail. I could smell Anjali’s spices on your breath—and I could see the spot of porridge left on your shirt.” He didn’t blink. “If you sit still and cease to be a teller of stories in the world, Nova Roma will treat you as a <em>listener</em>, and tell you everything there is to tell.”</p>
<p>I gulped.</p>
<p>Then he said, “Now, what can you tell me about me?”</p>
<p>I scrambled and looked around the room. “Well, you’ve been sitting here all day, and, uh…” There were old sandalwood candles burning in alcoves, a pair of shoes aligned next to the back door, and a bowl at a table, “And, you only had one meal, you prayed to The God early in the morning, before going on a morning walk around Edd Creek.”</p>
<p>He shook his head no. “A few observations without the context of the whole are nigh useless. You must learn to look at the whole, and the whole takes <em>time</em>. And <em>time</em> requires patience. Understand?”</p>
<p>I nodded, knowing that Edem Abril would have caught onto this game in a second. I felt so <em>wrong</em> being here.</p>
<p>Stone George closed his eyes and let loose a groan like a chasm after a quake.</p>
<p>“You are dismissed.”</p>
<hr />
<p>I could deal with the Mind Above’s puzzles a lot better now. He’d set them down and I could tease them apart in mere minutes.</p>
<p>“You’ve certainly improved,” he said.</p>
<p>I smiled and went through another four.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it’s time to graduate to a more difficult fare.” He swept aside the puzzles and set down a game board with red and blue squares, and pieces every color of the rainbow.</p>
<p>He sat opposite me and moved a piece.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you even going to tell me the rules?”</p>
<p>“After you exit the womb, did <em>life</em> tell you <em>its</em> rules?”</p>
<p>I shook my head no, and moved a piece. It went on like this for some time, while I tried to discern a pattern.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why I’m here.”</p>
<p>Mind Above remained silent.</p>
<p>“I could list a thousand names that would be better suited to this position than I am. Why me?”</p>
<p>Mind Above spoke without looking at me. “That’s a puzzle, is it not? And here I thought I had already taught you to solve those.”</p>
<p>I leaned back in my chair, straining to follow the movement of the pieces around the board.</p>
<hr />
<p>A year passed, and the next generation of children received their slips.</p>
<p>My little brother received Magistrate, to which he was well suited. Bryce’s sister Elizabeth was set to become a healer, which was also quite fitting, I believed.</p>
<p>The Senate had a knack for choosing exactly the right person for the job…</p>
<p>So why did I feel so out of place?</p>
<p>I sat in the square and pondered, as all the children received their new vocations.</p>
<p>What was the current Princeps doing in his House on the Hill? Did he engage in combat, after a lifetime of training with Abattoir Singh? Was he constantly assaulted by puzzles and odd games? Did he have to recount history? Did he travel for diplomacy, or did he build?</p>
<p>I waited like Stone George, and absorbed all that I could around me.</p>
<p>What kept this city running…?</p>
<hr />
<p>My next bout with Abattoir Singh went fast and furious, and I disarmed him with a masterful three stroke assault on the wrist.</p>
<p>He smiled. “You’re certainly feeling more alive in your skin, boy.”</p>
<p>I knew that.</p>
<p>When I went to sit with Stone George I stopped and listened to everything his room was telling me. Every day he’d do something more and more elaborate for me to figure out, and every day I could determine what it was with ease.</p>
<p>“You milked the cows at ten in the morning, returned here for a nap, ate a concoction of yuzu and fire fruit, went into Threepiece Forest for a swim in the waterfall, returned here to beat an indentation in the seat to make it seem as if you sat for hours, and here we are.”</p>
<p>He nodded sagely. “I sense you have become more confident in your station here, young one.”</p>
<p>That was true.</p>
<p>In my session with Mind Above, I beat him in the rainbow game with a five pronged strategy led by two centurions, a common legionnaire, a general, and the colored piece that represented myself.</p>
<p>“You’re certainly bolder than you’ve been before. Finally settling into being Princeps, I see.”</p>
<p>“It was just a matter of figuring out what it’s really all about.”</p>
<p>“And that is?”</p>
<p>“All of these skills are auxiliary. Fighting, strategizing, learning my histories, observing. The tutors are here because the Princeps is never expected to be a natural master of these fields.”</p>
<p>“Go on.”</p>
<p>“My whole first year here I knew that Gard or Art or Priya or a dozen other people could have excelled in the areas where I was struggling—but then I realized, <em>their</em> skills aren't what keep this city running.”</p>
<p>“And what keeps this city running?”</p>
<p>“The slips," I said. "Everyone needs to know what they’re going to be. And I can tell their strengths and weaknesses in an instant. The Princeps isn’t a fighter, or a diplomat. He lives in his House on the Hill… and he writes the slips.”</p>
<p>Mind Above removed the game pieces and smiled. </p>
<p>"It seems you've learned something here, after all."</p>
<p>And then he set down another board, bigger and far more complex.</p>

<h4>[WP] You live in a city full of people with powers (telekinesis, electro kinesis, sensors, etc) and everyone is ranked according to how powerful they but they can kill someone of higher rank and obtain their rank. You are rank #1 but no one knows what your power is</h4>
<p>Score: 2516</p>
<p>Everyone has these tags.  These little buttons on their shirts with a number on it.  Some in the hundreds, some in the thousands.  Mine is number 1.</p>
<p>Pretty quickly people started to figure out that when someone else died, everyone with a lower number moved up.  There wasn’t really much that this meant for the higher numbers, but for the lower numbers it was a bloodbath.  The higher numbers started by trying to kill the numbers above themselves, but there was a reason for the rankings.  5 fell to 3.  3 fell to 2.  Only number 17 managed to kill number 16, and even then it was with 18’s help.  He still wound up hooked to a machine for the short time he managed to live.  </p>
<p>Eventually they realized the better plan was to start killing the numbers lower than you.  2 killed 3-15, then 16 moves up, turns to 3.  That 3 kills 4-73, 74 moves up and becomes 4.  That 4 kills… and on and on.  It led to huge gaps in power between the top ten.  For all that time, nobody set their sights on me.  I’m number one.  Of course I am the strongest.  Far and away.  What can I do?  Only a handful of people ever knew, and that’s all they are now, a handful.  At least that’s what I tell people.  Reality is always such a letdown.   </p>

<p>For pity, perhaps, he went along with it, even though the rules made a final win impossible. If a few millenia had taught him anything, it was that this process need not be painful. Not in the moment. Later, when the realization of loss reverberates in and around those left behind, the pain would be as real and unavoidable as the sky. But that was not for him. He would be long gone. All that mattered was the boy. Would he come quietly, in peace?</p>
<p>He lay the scythe behind a tree and chased the boy with the golden hair, dusty orange stuffed tiger clutched close to his chest. The boy was unperturbed by this stranger. The boy explained the game - utter nonsense, he thought but did not say - and he agreed to the parameters. He hummed and harmonized with a Tum Tum as the song proclaimed the beginning. He grabbed a flag.</p>
<p>"Tag!" the boy shouted, "for four points!"</p>
<p>"Tag back," he said as he extended a bony finger, "for four!"</p>
<p>"No no no," the boy said, "the flag is now the Spire of Protection, so I am safe and you must recite Happy Birthday while Hobbes dances."</p>
<p>He obliged as best he could, his voice warbly and raw. He could not remember the last time he sang.</p>
<p>"The mask!" the boy said as he approached with a rag with two holes. </p>
<p>The dark man took the mask and wrapped his skull. They ran with waving flags. The ball flew through the sky, a brilliant red rubber ball shining against the white clouds above. The warm fall sun brought sweat to the boy's brow. The dark man had long ago lost his last bit of sweating flesh, but he still knew the heat. </p>
<p>"What is the score?"</p>
<p>"Seven to Washington," the boy said breathlessly. The disease was thick in his lungs. It would not be long.</p>
<p>"Hobbes has something to say," the boy shouted. </p>
<p>"What is that, Mr. Tiger?" the dark man said, his skepticism and detachment both eroded by the boy's effervescence.</p>
<p>He was startled as the tiger transmogified into a larger, vibrant, living version of itself.</p>
<p>"He's tired," the tiger said in a whisper. </p>
<p>"His life... so real, so unyielding," the dark man said. "I don't think he will come."</p>
<p>"Allow me," the tiger said.</p>
<p>He took the boy's hand and held it close.</p>
<p>"Calvin," the tiger said.</p>
<p>"You're it!" Calvin shouted.</p>
<p>"No... Calvin, it's time to rest," the tiger said. </p>
<p>"But the sun!" he said.</p>
<p>"Come with me," the tiger said. He lead the boy hand-in-hand to edge of the glade. </p>
<p>"We have a magical world ahead. Let's go exploring."</p>
<p>The dark man lifted his scythe and followed the two, treading lightly lest he disturb them. The tiger brought the boy into the light, and then they were all gone. Behind them the leaves steadily fell on the soft glade and the grass and all the world left gave a silent elegy. </p>

<h4>[WP] Due to a mix-up, the body count of all your video game kills is attributed to you personally. Upon your death, the Devil excitedly rushes to the gates of hell to greet you.</h4>
<p>Score: 2509</p>
<p>"It's such an honor to meet you, Mr. Langley," said the giant demonic figure before me. His smile seemed both genuine and terrifying.</p>
<p>I trembled before him. I tried to convince myself it was just a dream.</p>
<p>Satan extended his hand before me. His red skin looked like it was melting but not dripping. His fingernails had to be the length of my middle finger. He eyed me curiously as I left hanging what must've been a handshake offer.</p>
<p>"So," he said, clearing his throat. "I am a bit surprised." He looked me over a bit. I'm sure he noticed my shaking knees and the downpour of tears streaming down my cheeks.</p>
<p>He continued, "I wasn't expecting, uh... Er... Forgive me, Mr. Langley, but I'm just confused.. I, uh, thought you'd be a bit... Well, more intimidating than..."</p>
<p>He paused, collecting his thoughts.</p>
<p>"Well, it doesn't matter," the Devil said, waving a hand above his head as though to dismiss his thoughts. "It's great to have you here! I'd like to introduce you to so many people!"</p>
<p>Satan grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled me along. He pointed to a large, fiery river. "That's where the casuals go. You know, the people who probably would've gone to Heaven if they didn't suck one too many cocks or stole a Pok'emon card in elementary school," he said.</p>
<p>My knees buckled and I fell hard. Satan quickly helped me to my feet, apologizing for the rocky terrain we trudged on. </p>
<p>I heard moans and cries left, right, ahead, behind, above and below us. Fear isn't a strong enough word to describe the feeling that engulfed me.</p>
<p>We came along to an open pit with moaning souls reaching up, some begging for water while others simply begging. "Lucifer, pease..." I heard one woman moan. Satan spit in the pit. The wad splattered on the pit wall. The moaning souls fought each other towards the disgusting gloop. One girl, who I would've sworn was just a mere child, reached it by climbing the stony wall a bit. She licked and sucked the wad, a look of euphoria overcoming her face. The rest of the helpless sinners groaned and turned back to Satan, begging for more "water."</p>
<p>The Devil laughed and pushed me along. "Desperate fools," he said, grinning at me. I wouldn't doubt his teeth could carve through diamonds. "Some of those fuckers are Romans. Did you see the fattest one there? The one who the little girl climbed over to drink my nasty spit? He's Buddha!"</p>
<p>I wanted to ask why Buddha was in Hell, but the words wouldn't leave my voice box.</p>
<p>We made several more stops. Each one terrified me more than the last. And at each stop, Satan reiterated that these places were not for me. I don't know if it was possible, but I felt more frightened at the thought of my punishment.</p>
<p>We moved past serial killers, rapists, terrorists and lawyers. What could I have possibly done that warranted a worse punishment than these people?</p>
<p>Eventually, we entered an area that was not full of doom and gloom. There was pleasant greenery, shrubs growing with beautiful pink flowers blossoming, large trees that I would've loved climbing as a kid, a quiet waterfall ahead, and cute, small animals frolicking about.</p>
<p>"You're surprised, huh?" Lucifer asked. "I built this place to piss off God. Why should he have nice, beautiful areas to hang out in, and not me?"</p>
<p>We walked towards what appeared to be a mansion the size of ten football stadiums. The entire house was covered in gold. Two demons ahead pushed two giant, golden doors open for us. "Your darkness," they greeted, bowing before us.</p>
<p>Inside the large mansion were people standing around, drinking liquor and eating foods one would only find in 5-star restaurants. The people were excited to see me. They gathered before the Devil and me. Many held out their hands to touch me as Satan pushed me along through the rooms.</p>
<p>He introduced me to Adolf Hitler. I was appalled. This man was responsible for millions of deaths, yet here he was, lounging about with delicacies everywhere and two young, attractive, busty women at each arm.</p>
<p>Next, we met an Egyptian princess named Cleopatra II, who was introduced to me as the daughter of Cleopatra and Ptolemy V. Satan said the ancient Egyptian rulers were in Hell for inbreeding.</p>
<p>We met Stalin and Mussolini. Harvey Lee Oswald was close by, munching on shrimps by the boatload. A creepy-looking, dirty man was introduced to me as the Zodiac Killer.</p>
<p>We met Socrates ("He fucked little boys," Satan informed me.), Genghis Khan, Ivan the Terrible, Josef Mengele ("Auschwitz physician"), Elizabeth Bathory ("You don't wanna know."), Kim Jong Il and even Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein hurriedly greeted me before rushing off to bathe. Apparently, he enjoyed staying clean.</p>
<p>We met the worst human beings I had ever heard of, and we even met the worst human beings I never knew about.</p>
<p>Finally, Satan invited me into a private room. I gulped. <em>This must be it</em>, I thought. <em>He's going to ass fuck me. I hope I don't shit myself...</em></p>
<p>The room was dark but well-decorated. Paintings hung from the wall; a large chandelier towered above us; candles were lit, giving an incredible scent to the room.</p>
<p>Satan pointed me to a plush chair. It was velvety, soft to the touch and undoubtedly comfortable. But I couldn't relax.</p>
<p>He said across from me. Between us sat a table with two clean glasses and a large bottle of Crown Royal whiskey on it. The demon poured the drink into the glasses. The bottle magically refilled once Satan placed it back on the table.</p>
<p>He handed me a glass and said, "Drink up, my friend. We have much to discuss!"</p>
<p>I took a small sip and just eyed the devil. He downed his entire glass in one gulp, then leaned forward to pour more.</p>
<p>"You've killed a lot of people," he said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"Ex-excuse.. excuse me?" I stammered. Killed people? Me?! I could barely kill a fly!</p>
<p>"Oh, relax," Satan said, downing yet another glass full. "Ooh... I love this Canadian shit. They brew a mean whiskey."</p>
<p>"Sir, I-I-I've never.. nev--never.. I have nev---" I continued to stammer.</p>
<p>"God can't hear you here, Mr. Langley. Relax. You're safe. He thinks I'm punishing everyone, but there are some of you earthly sinners who intrigue me."</p>
<p>He drank and drank, the bottle never emptying, always refilling after every poured glass. I took another sip. I felt parched, but I knew alcohol wasn't going to help.</p>
<p>Satan then asked me about my kill ratio. I sat stunned. What did he mean?</p>
<p>I continued to deny ever murdering anyone. I could see my demonic captor's expression slowly change. He went from excited to annoyed.</p>
<p>"Listen, Mr. Langley," Satan sternly said. "I've seen your record. It shows you've killed several million people from the age of 6 until the day of your death. Hitler and these other assholes may have killed millions, but they didn't actually do the majority of the dirty work. You have! Now, stop fucking with me. I've invited you as a guest into my home. At least speak to me like a man and not some bitch with a stutter."</p>
<p>I mustered all my courage. "Look, Mr. Lucifer," I began. I immediately felt fear return as I stared Satan in his yellow, dreadful eyes. I chugged down my Crown Royal to build confidence and then stared at Satan's forehead to avoid his eyes.</p>
<p>"What?" Satan asked, rubbing his forehead. "Is there a pimple on me?"</p>
<p>I took a few deep breaths before saying, "Lucifer, there's been a mistake. I have not k-kill-killed a single human being in my life. I lived in my-my-mmmmy parent's basement and, uh, and surfed Reddit in between playing hours upon hours of Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto. I-I-I'm, I... I am pretty sure you're mistaking me for someone else."</p>
<p>Satan raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Furthermore," I continued, "I am a virgin. The last time I touched pussy, uh... Last time I-I-I-I touched vagina was on mmm-my way out of my mom's. I shouldn't be here. There are actual rapists outside this, umm, room. I'm-I'm..."</p>
<p>Satan facepalmed himself.</p>
<p>The smack of his palm across his forehead thundered in the room.</p>
<p>"Fuck..." he quietly said.</p>
<p>We sat in silence for what felt like an eternity. Satan leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. He sighed before turning back to me.</p>
<p>"Look, kid. We fucked up. I'm sorry," he said, sighing again. "But now there's nothing I can do to change this."</p>
<p>I felt myself cower into my chair.</p>
<p>"Relax," he said, noticing my fear emerge once again. "You didn't do anything wrong... Uh, I mean, you were a loser, but it wasn't your mistake. This has happened many times before. You losers spend all day playing your PlayBox One and your XStation 4. You actually get into the game and start imagining you really are Super Hilario and Monkey Dong or whatever. That fucks up our system and shows you guys as some bad ass killers when, in fact, you're a bunch of nerds with no aspirations."</p>
<p>He went on to explain that if I kept my mouth shut and just pretended that I was a murderer, he'd give me the royal treatment instead of dumping me in a pit somewhere or having his henchmen have their way with me. I agreed.</p>
<p>We got up to exit the room, but Satan stopped me.</p>
<p>"When you get out there, everyone will want to talk to you. I expect you to pretend you're one of your game characters and just make your stories believable. Can you do that?" he asked.</p>
<p>I replied, "Absolutely."</p>
<p>He grabbed the doorknob and began to turn it, but then turned to me and said, "Oh, and one more thing: you can't be Snake or whatever that Metal Gear Solid shit is. Someone else already told us stories about that."</p>
<p>"Aw, man..."</p>

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 2473</p>
<p>“So where are ya heading?” Jim asked, his turning down the secluded dirt road. It was his favorite spot for murdering thus far. Granted, it may have also been his only one thus far...</p>
<p>The woman had hardly said a word since he picked her up. She seemed bored, constantly staring out of her passenger window. It was all wrong. He liked to get them comfortable before doing the deed.</p>
<p>“Just the bus station,” she said.</p>
<p>“Really?” Jim raised an eyebrow. “What’s a pretty little miss like you needing to ride a gross bus for?”</p>
<p>“My mother’s in the hospital.”</p>
<p><em>Shit</em>, he thought. <em>It’s okay. Deep breaths, you can fix this.</em></p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Jim said with faux concern. He checked his gas light. The red light had flashed long enough. Just a little bit more…</p>
<p>Like an answer to his prayers, the truck began to sputter. It shook, the arrow on the speedometer slowly descending to zero. He frowned, hoping the woman wouldn’t see glee behind his mask. He didn't want to make her nervous. </p>
<p>“Dammit,” Jim barked as he banged on the steering wheel. “I’m out of gas. We’ll have to pull over.”</p>
<p>The woman shrugged, silent as ever. Something about her gesture made Jim nervous. He had never seen a hitchhiker look so indifferent. Yet, he liked it. She was his first true challenge.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jean stood to the side as Jim fiddled with the oil pan of his car.</p>
<p><em>He really is a moron, isn’t he? People are usually a little suspicious of hitchhikers but he’s treating me like a long lost friend. Shame, since I’ll be slitting his throat any moment now.</em></p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Jim called, breaking her thoughts.</p>
<p>Jean blinked, turning in his direction. The man had a goofy grin as he looked back at her, a streak of grease on his cheek. <em>A true idiot</em></p>
<p>“What?” she asked, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>“Well, I was wondering if you could give me a little help over here. It’s a tad complicated.”</p>
<p>“Putting gas in your car is complicated?”</p>
<p>“I never said I was a mechanic”</p>
<p>Jean sighed, walking over to help the dimwitted man. The closer she got, the more she noticed something… <em>off</em> about him. His demeanor, the way he hid a hand behind his back. She had practiced the same thing a thousand times before. It was a ploy - a bad one at that.</p>
<p>“What the fuck?” Jean furrowed her brow, backing away. “You have a knife, too?”</p>
<p>“What?” Jim began to sweat profusely. He wiped his forehead, revealing the gleam of a butcher’s cleaver in his closed fist. “Ah shit, wrong hand. But it's not what it looks like. I just keep this to check the fuselage and… wait, did you say ‘too’?”</p>
<p>Jean reddened, pulling her jacket closer to her body. The chilling sensation of the blade's flat side brushed against her side. So much for keeping her weapon a secret.</p>
<p>“Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t,” she started. “What’s it to you?”</p>
<p>Jim smiled, still cheery but different. Somehow more pleasant.</p>
<p>“You’re the Hitchhiking Murderer!” he said. “I’ve heard about you while watching TV. I must say, I’m a fan of your work.”</p>
<p>Jean stood flustered. “I… uh, thank you?”</p>
<p>“Jim Miller,” the man extended his hand. “I’m still new to the scene but I guess you could say I’m your opposite. I like to kill hitchhikers, rather than be one. I'll tell you, I never thought we’d cross paths this way. You’re even more beautiful than the rough sketches of you on the ten o'clock news.”</p>
<p>Jean blushed. <em>He can’t be serious.</em></p>
<p>“Thanks,” she paused. “So, are you not going to try and kill me?”</p>
<p>Jim shrugged. “I guess not. We don’t have to compete in the same pool for our victims so there’s no need to be territorial, right?”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>“So it’s settled.” Jim smiled. “We’re cool.”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Jean backed away, her eyes still glued to Jim's knife. He appeared friendly but if she learned anything, it was she couldn’t take chances. Yet, something told her he would stick to his word. He may have been a killer, but he was the earnest type.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she said, standing on the edge of the forest. Her voice echoed in the brisk night air as Jim perked his head up in anticipation of her words. “Next time, don’t make it so obvious that you’ll run out of gas. I could see you glancing at the meter every few seconds. And for the love of Christ, don’t show your knife until you’re about to kill someone. It's reeks of amateurishness. Don't give a bad name for the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Jim nodded, giving her a thumbs up. “You got it! Maybe one day, I’ll show you how much I’ve improved. I'll earn my name as an established serial killer and make you proud.”</p>
<p>Jean fought back smiling herself. <em>Stupid as ever</em></p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said, melting into the safety of the foliage. “Maybe one day.” </p>

<h4>[WP] Ok, bad news, good news. Bad news: you've died and have gone to Hell. Good news: since so many humans have died in recent years, humans have long since outnumbered demons 1000 to 1 and turned Hell into a pretty nice place.</h4>
<p>Score: 2473</p>
<p>"It was the Nazis that did it," the tour guide explained. "A bit ironic, really. Hell was already far overcrowded, but most damned souls were too beaten down and dejected to do anything about it. But there were so many soldiers pouring into Hell during the last days of World War II that the demons just couldn't process them fast enough. They had to set up these big temporary camps to house them all until Satan could personally determine their worst nightmare to torture them. Well wouldn't you know it, the Nazis didn't really like being herded together and put into camps! So they led the uprising against Satan's minions." </p>
<p>The guide's high heels clicked against the marble floor as she walked over to a massive painting, at least the size of a football field, depicting the first battle. According to the little placard, this had taken Caravaggio six years to paint. Post-uprising Hell was full of some incredible artwork, now that the great masters had been released from their prisons and were given limitless time and resources to make what they need. Even the Atrium that contained the waiting line to get into Hell made the Louvre look like an Alabama garage sale. </p>
<p>"Chancellor Hitler proclaimed amnesty for all past crimes committed up on the surface and dedicated himself to building this new utopia. Really, it was perfect for him and his many followers: the Jews, as God's Chosen People, are almost all up in Heaven. It seems that God cares more about the status of the tip of your penis and whether you eat pork than whether you were a virtuous person. So, no 'Final Solution' necessary in Hell.  Hitler restored order and even put the demons to work conjuring whatever society needs."</p>
<p>She led the way to another portrait, easily recognizable by the thin toothbrush mustache. The portrait was by Michaelangelo, who seemed to have taken the rejection from Heaven rather personally. He'd done a whole series of statues on the hypocrisy of the Bible and God himself. Another nearby picture showed Hitler summitting Lucifer's black stone throne and throwing Satan himself into the Abyss. "It's apocryphal, of course," the guide assured us. "In fact, no one knows what happened to Lucifer. He managed to flee in the midst of the fighting. Some say he returned to Heaven and asked for God's forgiveness. Others suggest that he's hiding out somewhere on Earth, trying to build his kingdom anew there."</p>
<p>She led the way to the next exhibit, where a video showed Dr. Sigmund Freud establishing a psychological institute to help the damned recover from centuries of torture. It turns out that God wasn't a big fan of psychologists; something about how they had usurped the traditional confessional role of priests or something. He didn't care too much that they were just trying to help people. There's a little saying in Hell that God's rules are about as fixed and permanent as a gust of wind. Shit, most people here thought that they were pretty pious back when they were still alive. You'd be shocked at just how many popes there are down here. "Everyone pitched in," the guide narrated as the video showed a montage of humans filling in the pits of fire and brimstone, and planting farms and gardens. No one needed to eat down here, it was just nice to have fields and pastures. "Everyone did their part to make Hell a better place." The video ended with an overview of the massive city skyline, full of flying cars and all sorts of other futuristic concepts. You'd be surprised what Einstein, Da Vinci, and uncountable other geniuses could accomplish with unlimited time and resources. </p>
<p>The final exhibit on the tour was titled <em>The Future.</em> "Chancellor Hitler's vision of Hell is not limited to just creating a paradise here," the guide continued as we walked through the door. "Though Hell has been retaken from the demons, there are still <em>billions</em> of souls on the surface, suffering and toiling through God's tests. Trying to scrape by on meager food because God thinks hardship will inspire faith. Trying to fight greed and lust because God has taught them that they shouldn't enjoy food and flesh. Torturing themselves when they should be living their lives as they want. Just like we do down here."</p>
<p>The exhibit was not grandly decorated by works by famous masters. The walls were bare and the room was hardly lit. Only a single bulb illuminated one exhibit, a small glittering object of metal gears and glass panes. "This is a prototype," she said, "Of the machine that will open up The Doorway."</p>

<h4>[WP] You're on your death bed, and the personification of your greatest regret has come to say goodbye.</h4>
<p>Score: 2461</p>
<p>A stranger has come to visit me. She says she is family, but I have no family. No wife, no children, no parents, no siblings. I've never laid eyes on her before. Nonetheless, I can't deny our connection. She has my clear grey eyes and ginger hair and the same distinctive jawline and cheekbones. And moreover, the tenderness with which she treats me in my fragile state, clinging to this world by a thread, says more than appearances ever could. She is sorry she never had the chance to see me before and she sheds a tear at seeing me in this state, and the gentle warmth of her hand round mine is all the comfort in the world. </p>
<p>She tells me about her life. Her happy family childhood back in my old home town, after I'd already left. The success she'd enjoyed at college, buoyed up by the support from her father telling her that hard work would bring such rewards. The hard lessons she'd learnt in love and the joy she'd won in return when she discovered what was right for her. Whatever my conservative views, I could feel her joy when she described falling in love with a woman for the first time and my antipathy towards that lifestyle was swept away by the smile on her face. </p>
<p>She asked me about my life. My sorry childhood didn't match up to hers, raised with the fear of hell and beatings that left me always battling to prove myself as an adult. When I left for university it was a weight released, but the discipline stood me in good stead. My self-control won me awards, a career that from the first day supported me, the girl I loved, our dream wedding and home and everything she and I wanted. But then my need to prove myself took everything away. When I was offered my dream job on the other coast, she wouldn't come. Her family and friends meant more to her than me. She wanted me to decline it, but I saw that as failure. She stayed and I went and we tossed our marriage away. </p>
<p>I threw myself into my career to numb the pain, and my success was tremendous, but with no one to make happy with it, the shine was gone. Woman after woman came into my life and left but I never found love again. Looking into this stranger's eyes, I can see my ex-wife's love for me shining through and what I've known for years comes flooding out in tears - I walked away from the best thing I could ever have had. </p>
<p>She cradles me close as the regret consumes me. I blink through my tears and ask her, <em>what if? What if I'd stayed? I could've been so happy. I could've had the world.</em> I wish I'd realised then what was of true value, as I do now. Here I am, alone, with only a stranger to see me through my darkest, final night.</p>
<p>She wipes away my tears with gentle fingers. <em>The world,</em> she whispers, <em>and more. Your wife would have loved you more each day. And you could have had me, dad. You could have had me.</em></p>

<p>His voice is difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Picture this: your eardrum is a cigarette filter and his mouth is the burning sunspot of the lit end.</p>
<p>Whenever he speaks, it’s like your brain’s taking a long, long drag.</p>
<p><em>”Remember that little deal we had a while back?”</em></p>
<p>Deal? More like ‘scam’. “The deal we made when I was just a kid? <em>Yeah,</em> I remember that deal.”</p>
<p><em>”Whoa, now,”</em> he said. <em>”I’m detecting a little bit of acid in your speech, there. You angry about something?”</em></p>
<p>“You made a deal with an eight year-old, you colossal douchebag. I wanted to be a ‘space cowboy’, and you took my soul over that?” I shook my head. “What the hell, man?”</p>
<p><em>“Right. About that...”</em> He smiled and it was like watching a crack form in the glacial north arctic. Every time he did it you just knew that some polar bear was getting his life screwed over. <em>“Turns out,”</em> he said, with that same smile, <em>“that your little eight year-old fantasy may not be so useless after all.”</em></p>
<p>I turned around and started locking up the drawers. I was closing up the coffee shop tonight. “Get to the point, Devil.”</p>
<p>His eyes glimmered with some inner light. <em>“Well, I have a particularly difficult task I need your expertise with. I need some space cowboying done.”</em></p>
<p>“You’re shitting me.”</p>
<p><em>”I shit you not. Do this for me, and you’ve got your soul back.”</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Apparently, demons, angels and all of that nonsense have pretty unlimited power anywhere that <em>isn’t</em> outer-space.</p>
<p><em>”Yeah,”</em> said the Devil. <em>”Not our domain, breaching contract, etcetera etcetera. Point is, we can’t really go into the ‘void’ or anything. Not even in a ship. If we want to get to a planet we gotta take the worm tubes.”</em></p>
<p>“…So why don’t you just do that?”</p>
<p><em>”Well, this target of mine is on something called a ‘space-station’. You heard of that?”</em></p>
<p>“Of course I have. I’m not an idiot.”</p>
<p>He shrugged. <em>”I can never really tell with you mortals. Anyway, you’re going to need to get on this,”</em> he traced air quotes with his fingers, <em>“‘space-station’, and then you’re going to retrieve my little item. Think you can do that?”</em></p>
<p>No, of course I didn’t think I could do that. But this was my immortal soul we were talking about, here. How could I do anything less than try? “Sure, I think I can do that. How do I get there?”</p>
<p><em>”Well, you’re going to take a worm tube to your launch point, first. Wouldn’t want you to have to worry about all the niggly aspects of interstellar travel that ain’t instantaneous, you know?”</em></p>
<p>“Where’s the tube?”</p>
<p><em>“Where’s the…?”</em> He laughed and held up something suspiciously like a detonator. He put on his best Wizard of Oz voice and boomed, <em>“The tube was always inside you! The tube was always…!”</em></p>
<p>Then he clicked the button and the world faded through white.</p>
<hr />
<p>I didn’t stop throwing up for what felt like hours.</p>
<p>When I could finally look up, a horned face looked down at me with angry red eyes. The Devil usually cleaned himself up, but it looked like his underling demons didn’t really give a shit if they looked like the combined result of a halloween bargain bin and the nightmares of a toddler.</p>
<p>His voice was gruff. “You are ’Gabe’?”</p>
<p>I spit the taste of vomit out of my mouth. “Yeah, that’s me.”</p>
<p>He snorted. “Come with me.” </p>
<p>I followed his spiny back through a pair of airlocks, a de-licing room—“You kidding me, fellas? I don’t have lice!”—a decontamination room, and finally, a prep room.</p>
<p>Hornface pointed at a locker. “Suit is in there. Put it on, get ready.”</p>
<p>He watched me intently. </p>
<p>I cleared my throat, “Uh, not going to give me some privacy, here?”</p>
<p>“Why you need privacy?”</p>
<p>“I’m about to get naked, bud.”</p>
<p>“So? I am also naked.”</p>
<p>He… had kind of a point. I wasn’t going to press the issue, so I got out of my clothes, slipped into an undersuit, and worked my way into the outer hard-shelled carapace.</p>
<p>It all came so easy. Like I’d been doing this for decades. </p>
<p>Hornface grunted. “Ready now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah.” I did final seal checks and gave my helmet a good knock for good luck. “Where are we headed now?”</p>
<p>“Your ship.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The space-ship was something only a hellspawn could have devised. It was covered in what looked like volcanic rock, with glowing orange rivulets running hot in the contours and gothic spikes thrusting up off the hull like undersea vents.</p>
<p>“Really, guys? Not even thinking about aerodynamics here, huh?”</p>
<p>Hornface shrugged. “No air in space. If no aerodynamics, why not make look cool?”</p>
<p>“You know, Hornface, you’re really not as stupid as you sound.”</p>
<p>He scowled. “English not first language. Maybe you try speaking in Tongues?” </p>
<p>The demon spoke fluent gibberish for a good half minute before I said, “Yeah, maybe not.”</p>
<p>He pushed me towards the cockpit and said, “You go now. Computer tell you what do.”</p>
<p>Uh-huh. I jumped into the cockpit and it locked closed around me. The thing was shot through with a diffuse orange glow.</p>
<p>“Um. Computer?”</p>
<p>The console came alive with red light, and there was a voice: “WHAT DO YOU WANT, PEASANT?”</p>
<p>“Jesus, computer. Lighten up.”</p>
<p>“LIGHTENING UP IS NOT IN MY PROGRAMMING. STATE YOUR REQUEST, FOOL.”</p>
<p>Just like the Devil to give me a ship that berates me. What a dick.</p>
<p>“Start up nav for this space station I’m supposed to get on.”</p>
<p>“BE POLITE AND PERHAPS I WILL DO THIS.”</p>
<p>“Start up nav, <em>please.</em>” Fucking computer.</p>
<p>“PERFORMING AS REQUESTED. BRACE FOR ACCELERATION.”</p>
<p>I tried to ‘brace for acceleration’, I really did. But instead I got my teeth rattled so hard you could have sworn I was playing the maracas.</p>
<hr />
<p>After a good half hour of having my body smushed up against the seat, the computer finally said:</p>
<p>“YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT YOUR DESTINATION.”</p>
<p>Thank fucking God.</p>
<p>“NOW RETURNING MANUAL CONTROL. GOOD LUCK WITH EVASIVE MANEUVERS.”</p>
<p>Wait, <em>what?</em> Two joysticks flipped up from the console and the main-screen went bright with the afterburners of a thousand missiles. Defensive emplacements. <em>Shit.</em></p>
<p>My hands went to the sticks like they were magnetized, and I whipped the ship into a roll. It was all instinct.</p>
<p>“YES, ROLLS. THE BEST MANEUVER FOR DIZZYING YOURSELF AND EASING THE SWEET EMBRACE OF DEATH.”</p>
<p>I zipped past the first cluster of missiles and swooped low under what looked like a pure white archway.</p>
<p>What I didn’t realize was that I was flying straight through a half-meter of stained glass.</p>
<p>The ship shuddered and the glass cracked to pieces, and about 60% of the missiles slammed into the arch and took it off the space-station’s hull.</p>
<p>…Which still left around 400 missiles on my ass.</p>
<p>“MAY I RECOMMEND MAKING PEACE WITH YOUR GOD?”</p>
<p>I hit the accelerator and went in a wide loop, dragging as many missiles I could with me. The lagging ones clustered up, came flush up against each other, and disappeared in a flash.</p>
<p>Still about a hundred missiles, real close now. They could accelerate much faster than what was physiologically possible for me.</p>
<p>Shit. </p>
<p>“Computer, do we have weapons systems?”</p>
<p>“OH, RIGHT. WE DO.”</p>
<p>“Shoot them, you son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>“SHOOTING, SHOOTING…”</p>
<p>The cockpit rumbled as the guns on my ship’s hull took out the missiles with a couple hundred thousand bullets. </p>
<p>“How do I get inside this thing? And what the hell am I supposed to find?”</p>
<p>“MARKING ENTRANCE POINTS NOW. YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HARD DRIVE.”</p>
<p>“A hard drive?”</p>
<p>“DID I STUTTER?”</p>
<hr />
<p>I jumped through some obscure airlock in a nook on the massive space-station and found my way inside. </p>
<p>The hardline inside my helmet crackled. “THE STATION IS SPARSELY INHABITED. THE HARD DRIVE SHOULD BE LOCATED… HERE.”</p>
<p>A nav-point sparked orange in my vision.</p>
<p>Alright, easy enough. Follow the yellow-brick road, and all. And maybe—</p>
<p>I stopped.</p>
<p>Behind me was this conspicuous silence—like when there are footsteps matching yours in a dark alley, and you stop to see if they continue, but all you hear is this loud and pregnant quiet.</p>
<p>I kept walking, and could swear something was doing the same behind me.</p>
<p>It raised the hairs on my neck. </p>
<p>By the time I reached the pick-up point, I had almost gotten used to the Computer’s insane drawlings. </p>
<p>“I HOPE YOU GET CAUGHT AND ANALLY PROBED.”</p>
<p>The hard drive was squirreled away in a filing cabinet, just like any other hard drive. I picked it up, put in my pouch, and turned to face the most ugly-pleasant thing I have ever seen.</p>
<p>It was ugly because of all the warts and facial protrusions, and pleasant because the expression of its face was calmer than a zen cow. </p>
<p>“Ah… Hello?”</p>
<p>“THAT IS AN ELDIL YOU DINKUS. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.”</p>
<p>“What do I do with it?”</p>
<p>“IGNORE IT AND COME BACK TO THE SHIP.”</p>
<p>I waved goodbye and the Eldil stared serenely through me. Weird.</p>
<p>Anyway, time to run. I had a soul waiting for me.</p>
<hr />
<p>A hop, skip, and a worm-tube later and I was back in the empty coffee shop. The Devil was smoking a cigar in the dark.</p>
<p><em>”You got the stuff?”</em></p>
<p>“You got the money?” I cleared my throat, “Ehrm, I mean, you got my soul?”</p>
<p>He snapped and I felt… nothing at all. Sometimes I thought that these demon-types <em>made up</em> the idea of souls, just so they could have something to hold over you. Leverage. There’s no way I’d risk <em>not</em> believing though, you know? The cost of being wrong would be way too huge. Which I guess is how the whole scam worked.</p>
<p>The Devil clicked his fingers on the table. <em>”I’m waiting.”</em></p>
<p>I tossed him the hard drive and he smiled that killer’s smile. <em>”Thank you.”</em> </p>
<p>And then he ripped the drive in two with his bare hands. He crushed the two separate pieces to dust.</p>
<p>“What was on that thing, anyway?”</p>
<p><em>”The contract keeping us from going up there,”</em> he said, pointing skyward.</p>
<p>“Space? Why do you want to go there, anyway?”</p>
<p>His face split into a rictus. <em>”It’s the final frontier, my boy. The final frontier.”</em></p>

<h4>[WP] Soul mates are real and technology has finally allowed for detection of some peoples “other half" at the speed of light using quantum messaging. When you were tested there was no response, now 10 years later you are called in to let you know a response has just arrived.</h4>
<p>Score: 2443</p>
<p>I'm probably the only person in the world who was happier <em>before</em> the Match Database was invented. </p>
<p>I went on my eighteenth birthday with my twin brother Erik as soon as we were eligible for testing. The line stretched around the block, as it was still a fairly new technology back then. There were still people in their pre-Match relationships, which don't really exist now. Nowadays, the only people who need to use the service are those who are just coming of age. The thing about the Match Database is that you only ever need to use it once. "Soul mate" means a companion for life, and once you've found that one, there's never a need to use the database again. Unless you're like me, that is.</p>
<p>Erik found his match right away. He sent out the standard message with his name, contact information, etc. And the response came back immediately from his soul mate, Trinh. I still remember his beaming smile, and he was already on his smartphone booking a flight to Vietnam. And then I stepped up to the terminal and put my hand in for testing. The machine glowed blue, indicating that a match had been found and a connection set. So I sent the message.</p>
<p>I looked around the clinic, not sure what should have happened. It seemed like Erik's response was instantaneous. All soul mates were roughly the same age, so most were tested around the same time and could message back and forth almost immediately. "It's all right," the clinic tech answered. "Sometimes it takes a while, like if your match is asleep at the moment. It happens a lot with all of the different time zones. Just go home and wait for the answer."</p>
<hr />
<p>I've been waiting for ten years now. Ten long years of having every person I know rub their happiness in my face. Erik and Trinh, married now, are really the only ones who at least try not to make me feel bad about it. But even between them, I can <em>feel</em> their energy. Their strong connection. And their happiness. And it always just reminds me of what I'm missing out on. </p>
<p>I used to hate dating back in high school before I got matched. I really did. I was shy and clumsy and tongue-tied and I never knew what to talk about. You have <em>no idea</em> what I'd give to go on an awkward blind date now. There are no more single people left. That's not an exaggeration: <em>everyone</em> has used the match clinic and found their soul mate. As far as I know, I'm the only person who never got a response. I've heard of people waiting up to a year, but no further than that. </p>
<p>I try to maintain a normal life. I have a studio apartment, which are a rarity nowadays. Most of them have been combined into spacious one-bedrooms for all of the couples out there. At least the lack of demand leads to some pretty cheap rent for me, right? The only way to survive as the only single man in the world is to stay positive. </p>
<p>At work, I'm a fairly solitary person. I keep my head down and get my work done on time. I eat lunch at my desk while everyone else usually meets their soul mate for an hour or so mid-day. A lot of them go out for happy hour and such afterwards, but I usually head straight home. You'd think that being with friends would cheer me up, but it just reminds me that I'm an eternal third wheel. At least my cat and my TV don't have soul mates to rub in my face.</p>
<hr />
<p>I went into the Match Database clinic the other day. The bored attendant was certainly shocked to see me, a 28-year-old man. Everyone my age had been Matched successfully a decade ago. "Um... can I help you?" he asked. </p>
<p>"I want a new match," I told him. </p>
<p>He looked down at the machine, then back at me. "What?"</p>
<p>"A new match!" I yelled, louder than I'd intended. I pounded a fist on the counter and glared at him. "How hard is that to understand?"</p>
<p>He shrank back against the far wall and pushed the machine toward me. "I don't think that's how it works..." he stammered. </p>
<p>I picked the machine up and smashed it to the ground, where it exploded in a spray of plastic bits and wires. Just for good measure, I kicked a few of the pieces and then stormed out.</p>
<p>That was the night I tried to commit suicide.</p>
<hr />
<p>"David?" It was Erik, as usual. He's generally the only person who calls me now that Mom has passed on. "I think you need to come over here." </p>
<p>I sighed and rolled over to check the clock. 10 A.M., far earlier than I normally woke up now that I'd lost my job. "Why?" I asked. It was a question that I'd been asking a lot recently. Why go on?</p>
<p>"Just come," Erik said. "It's worth it, I promise."</p>
<p>I grumbled, but in the end managed to get out of bed and scrape together the effort to shower and dress. If it had been anyone other than Erik, I would have just hung up. </p>
<p>I pulled up in front of our old house, where Erik and Trinh now lived with their little daughter, and took a deep breath before exiting the car. It seemed like everything was a chore nowadays, and I was just too tired to continue. Half of me wanted to just drive back home and crawl back under the covers and wallow in my own pity for a while longer. But then I noticed the car parked in the driveway. Not Erik's, nor Trinh's. And curiosity got the better of me. </p>
<p>The doorbell chimed cheerfully, and Trinh answered the door with a wide grin. "David!" She wrapped her arms around me in a big hug. "I'm so happy you came!" She was normally a pretty upbeat person, but this was over the top even for her. Maybe she was overcompensating for the cloud of gloom that hovered over me at all times. "Come in!"</p>
<p>She led me into the living room, where Erik was sipping coffee with the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. Long black hair flowed over her pale shoulders, and she had sparkling, vivid blue eyes. </p>
<p>"David!" Erik said as I entered the room. "So great to see you. <em>This</em>," he gestured to the woman, "Is Candice."</p>
<p>Reality came rushing back, and I remembered who I was. Like everyone else, Candice would have a soul mate. How could she <em>not</em>? My constant stormclouds reappeared.</p>
<p>"It's a pleasure to finally meet you," she said softly. </p>
<p><em>Finally?</em></p>
<p>"Candice here has been in a coma," Erik said. He could barely contain the eager enthusiasm in his voice. "For the past <em>eleven</em> years. She said that she heard your name and address in a dream."</p>
<p><em>Eleven years...</em> My mind had stopped working.</p>
<p>She batted her eyelashes. "I got your message, David."</p>

<h4>[WP] A group of Viking encounters a Siren at sea, her voice is luring the men to their doom - except one. Now it's up to a closeted gay Viking to save the day.</h4>
<p>Score: 2434</p>
<p>Bjarke heard a melodious voice sail over the sides of the longship, weaving promises in the minds of those around him.</p>
<p>For the love of Odin, he thought, rolling his eyes. It's a damn Siren.</p>
<p>He looked at his men, who were entranced by the hypnotizing voice and moving close to the railing. If he didn't act soon, he'd lose his whole daft crew in seconds to the cunning beast. Bjarke spent the next several minutes strongarming his magicked crew into the belly of the longship before bolting the door shut from the outside. Lucky for him, his mother had been a witch and he was able to knock them out with a simple spell. That would prevent any of them from hacking a hole in the side of his ship. He worked hard to build it and Bjarke wasn't about to let some song-drunk idiot sink it.</p>
<p>The lilting voice grew stronger as the Siren tried to beckon the men. Bjarke stepped up to the railing.</p>
<p>"For Thor's sake, shut the hell up, you hussy!" he shouted over the gray water.</p>
<p>He saw head pop out of the water, rage written on her beautiful features. In an instant, the silver-haired Siren was at the side of the longship and scowling up at him.</p>
<p>"Hussy!" she shrieked. "Listen here you sansorðinn! I may be a lot of things but a hussy is not one of them. I will drag you down to a watery death."</p>
<p>Bjarke give her an amused smile. It would be a joy to tease this creature.</p>
<p>He brought his meticulously cared for nails to his face for inspection before saying, "What could you possibly need with all the men on my ship if not to be a hussy."</p>
<p>The woman sputtered in shock before summoning a wave to push herself onto the boat's deck. Bjarke yelped in surprise as he was soaked from head to toe. Great. This was one of his nicest shirts and now it was covered in seaweed and salt water. Blinking the stinging water from his eyes, the Viking saw the Siren stand up, her scaled tail disappearing now that she was no longer in the water. She stood before him naked, her long silvery strands of hair covering her breasts.</p>
<p>"You listen to me," she hissed, poking him in the chest with sharp fingernail. "I am Iona, a magnificent creature of the sea descended from Ægir himself. I will not be reduced to the image of a wanton woman by the likes of you."</p>
<p>Bjarke merely stared at Iona, unperturbed.</p>
<p>"Why are you not affected by my singing," the Siren asked, suddenly curious. "You are a male of a hale and hearty stock. You should have been one of the first to respond to my beckoning."</p>
<p>Bjarke's eye twitched. Yes, she would think that, wouldn't she. This was a secret he had kept close always. A secret that, if revealed, would come with a price. He was not ready to lose all he had worked hard for.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well. Not all of us are tricked by your charms."</p>
<p>Iona pursed her lips and circled him like a vulture.</p>
<p>"Hmmm," she said, tapping a finger to her lips. She glanced down towards his groin. "Are you lacking the needed equipment?"</p>
<p>Bjarke glared at her.</p>
<p>"I have perfectly working 'equipment' thank you very much."</p>
<p>Iona's perfectly shaped brows raised up high in realization.</p>
<p>"You're fuðflogi," she said, breathlessly. "That makes so much sense."</p>
<p>The Viking shushed the Siren harshly.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said in a hushed voice, despite the fact they were the only two conscious on the longship. "But no one knows."</p>
<p>"It is not an evil thing to desire the love of another man," Iona said to the burly, bearded man.</p>
<p>"Not everyone sees it that way," he said gruffly, running his hand over his braided blonde hair. "I will have to marry soon or else they will know."</p>
<p>"I will make you a deal," Iona said, taking sudden pity on the man. "I will help make you the most feared viking in the world if you take me away from this Odin-forsaken spit of land I've been stuck on. "</p>
<p>Bjarke looked at the silver-haired maiden curiously.</p>
<p>"You are a Siren," he said. "Can you not travel the waters freely?"</p>
<p>"Not as freely as you think," she said, sadly. "If I am captured in my human form, I am bound to them and the magic chaining me to this barren place will be split. I will instead by chained to you until you die."</p>
<p>"I would not wish that on anyone," he said.</p>
<p>"It is what I wish. It seems it would not be so bad to be chained to you until your death," Iona said thoughtfully. "I will appear as your wife and help you claim the world. Then we will both be free. I am able to mask my voice as to not charm your village. All you need to do is bind me to you through blood."</p>
<p>Bjarke looked at her, considering her offer. From his belt he drew a knife, slicing a shallow cut down is arm. He held it out to Iona, who mimicked his actions.</p>
<p>"Deal."</p>

<h4>[WP] Do the crime, do the time - but the reverse is also true, you can choose to serve jail time in advance of any crime you want to commit. After voluntarily spending 50 years in prison one individual is set to be released and the world watches in anticipation of whatever they do next.</h4>
<p>Score: 2410</p>
<p>After fifty years of willing incarceration, I left. My time had been served with no crime to its name, and now, I could put that time towards any offence I chose. A smile played at my lips.</p>
<p>The world watched as I took my first step from prison. Underfoot, the pavement created a mosaic: the hard, blackened crust of society cracked under the steady press of nature. I watched it, silent. The click of cameras and shouts of reporters faded from my ears. The rays of the sun flowed over me, and my lungs filled with fresh air until every dark nook that had festered for fifty years was eradicated. I released the darkness in a breath. At the hiss, the nearest camera man squeaked and scurried back. My smile grew.</p>
<p>The pavement crackled as I took another step. Around me, the ring of humanity expanded. Fingers tightened around microphones, faces paled, and arms shook. The power of it surged through me with my next breath, and a chuckle broke free.</p>
<p>I stepped again, then again. The crowd expanded, and the mosaic crumbled further underfoot. I was not trapped; not by walls, or barbed wire. Not by guards or guns. Not even society could hold me, for I had embraced the punishment it offered and come out the other side unbroken.</p>
<p>I left the crowds behind and fear in my wake. Yet, it was not me they feared; it was what I carried. For years, people believed me imprisoned while they walked free, but in truth, it was the opposite. While their walls of rules and intimidation grew, mine fell away. Now, I was free, and in my freedom they saw their prison. And they knew they would never leave. </p>

<h2>MR GUMPUS</h2>
<p>"Good night Mr Gumpus." I said, shifting him into the crook of my arm. His patchy fuzz scratching my neck as it has for so long. Over the years his fur has slowly been going, I have replaced his glass eye's so many times I can do it in my sleep now. I have repaired his arm onto his body before in one of the many fights with my sister. Neither of us every know what we fight for any more but it has been going off and on for the last year or so.</p>
<p>About the same amount of time that mommy has really gotten into those adult drinks she wont share with us.</p>
<p>I try to smile into my pillow as I used to when I thought of mom. The memories of being tucked in, of being soothed to sleep. Her comforting hand on my head when even Mr Gumpus was not enough.</p>
<p>Now I just remember her sitting in front of the tv waiting for daddy to finally get home.</p>
<p>He works so hard these days. Some nights, like tonight, I dont even get to see him before he gets home. He is not there to kiss me good night, to check my closet or below my bed for monsters. He never remembers to leave the door slightly open either. I need Mr Gumpus.</p>
<p>I can feel the soft blanket of night settle over me and snuggle deeper against Mr Gumpus.</p>
<p>"Poor kid." I mutter as I watch Michael finally succumb to sleep. I am too old now, too old for this. Checking my dodgy arm to see if his work will hold this time. Looks good but a little stiff. At least this time I will have both eyes. That was a bad few weeks when I had no depth perception. I barely kept the monster at bay.</p>
<p>Straightening up out of Michael's sleeping grip I readied myself. Another night of battle. I should have been retired years ago but he kept holding on. Poor bastard. I did not have a lot left in me. Looking over my patched and worn form I thought that I probably did not have much longer left, neither of us did.</p>
<p>I could hear Mary down in the den, the TV running way too loud. Another heavy night of drinking. I wonder what excuse Paul will bring home tonight. He has been getting worse and worse. Shivering as I recall the event two weeks ago. That had really taken the stuffing out me. Grinning mirthlessly at the old pun I could still remember the front door banging open. The smell of beer and cigarettes heavy in the air. Fighting against the plume of smoke and alcohol sprites as they tried to enter Michaels room. I had kept them at bay.</p>
<p>Then Mary had heard him. Stomping up the hallway, bringing with her a cloud of betrayal sprites. When she saw him in his state there was no defense that Paul could offer this time. His usual bout of "Late work" or "international call" would not do it. Even so I could see the lying wisps flickering around his head but thankfully none of them were fully formed.</p>
<p>Shaking my head I brought myself back to the present as I heard a taxi outside. Readying myself, I didn't know what to expect tonight but for Michael's sake I would try. I felt so goddamn tired. I should have been given a proper burial years ago, added to the other fallen warriors into the great Box in the Attic. No time for pity now, the front door was opening.</p>
<p>Instantly seduction and infidelity wisps, fully grown, started to stream into Michaels room. I stood straight up on the side of his bed and starting to fight. Shielded with Trust and Faith, my trusty short swords I spun them through the air, matching their dancing flights. There were too many!</p>
<p>Paul's heavy breathing in the hallway summoned alcohol and pain fairies into existence with each breath. They flocked towards Michael, threatening to destroy him. Arms blurring I kept them at bay. Trust and Faith were flashing faster and faster, my repaired arm was already starting to ache. No! Mary had not even shown up yet! Not tonight, I would not let them through tonight! The fairies and wisps were circling ahead trying to find a way past my defenses. I would not let them.</p>
<p>The sound of the TV from the den died.</p>
<p>I got a brief respite from the battle. They attackers were waiting for reinforcements. Mary was coming.</p>
<p>"What the hell kind of time do you call this!?" The cry bounced down the corridor bringing jealousy and its own pain fairies winging along with it. The battle was rejoined. They struck.</p>
<p>I was dancing, spinning my way through the forms taught to me by my Master, The Great Pillow Lion. I could do this, I could feel the tide of the battle holding. I just had to keep it up. My fur was fraying more and more but I could keep this up. I could for Michael.</p>
<p>"Lay off Mary. I have had a long day and I just want to get home without you yelling at me!" Paul rejoined. Oh God. Resentment worms, giant pale slugs had started to inch their way across the threshold. Spiralling and keeping an eye on them, I had heard tales of these but never had to face them in battle. Not tonight, please.</p>
<p>"You had a long day? A long day with that 'secretary' of yours no doubt!" These were no longer pain fairies, they were too big! Giant winged monsters, dark black and mottled red started to zip into the room. Their ponderous leathery wings joining the lighter, higher notes of their cousins.</p>
<p>I spared a glance back at Michael, still sleeping the sleep of the innocent. I would not fail tonight. The resentment worms had started to work their way up the edge of the bed. It was too much. I would have to call upon the magics that I knew were running out. It was a scarce resource but I had to keep going and against this onslaught? I needed it.</p>
<p>Muttering a word I tapped into Michaels sleeping form, shunting down through his memories I dug and dug for an unused memory.</p>
<p>There were precious few left for my needs. The Slugs were getting closer, on the blanket now and sliming their sightless way towards Michaels sleeping form. The aerial assault was not stopping, I kept digging through his memories, there had to be something left!</p>
<p>There! I found it. It was a bright and sunny Saturday. Michael was about 5 and Nancy, his sister was 7. It was a family bbq down by the river and they spent the day playing cricket with a tennis ball and bat from a plank of discarded wood.</p>
<p>Trust and Faith burst into brilliant light, lit by Love. They flashed down and severed the leading head of the Resentment Slug clean off. For a moment the onslaught paused in the face of this defense. I didn't wait, winding my way quickly through the last of the slugs, their filthy tar like blood leaving streaks on my blades.</p>
<p>Outside though, I knew it would not last. There were no lies being brought into existence. Ohh God no, he couldn't be could he? I shook my head despairingly. Then I hear the soft 'Whump' of what should have been Truth angels. But I knew these would be twisted and dark.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I was. Stacey never yells at me. She loves me as a man. I don't have to put up with her bitching at me all the time." Paul whispered out.</p>
<p>What should have been glorious incarnations of light brought forth via truth did not appear. Instead they were deformed versions, their wings dripping gore, their faces transfigured and horrible. They flew not with their swords of Truth and Faith but with Viciousness and Hate. They were coming straight for me.</p>
<p>Steadying my grip on Trust and Faith I was ready to bring battle. My fur was missing in so many places. My stitched arm was barely holding on. I had lost an ear at some point in the fight but I don't remember when. The dark ichor from the slugs was eating into my stuffing. I would win this fight for Michael as I had done countless nights before.</p>
<p>Then I heard Mary crying. </p>
<p>More and more winged beast joined the fray. I knew then that I would have to draw on the dark powers. They were shown to me one night by the Great Pillow Lion. That night when Paul and Mary had fought for hours. When they were both crying. We were lost when the Great Pillow Lion had turned to me and said</p>
<p>"I am going to show you something. I hope you never have to use it. To draw on it too deeply is its own kind of death."</p>
<p>I needed that power now. The ichor was covering the blades, dulling their fiery glow. I closed my eyes and drew deeply. I could feel it, the black welling up and covering not just the swords but myself. I felt murky and soiled. I drew deeper and hardened myself to it, ready to use the power of Denial.</p>
<p>I stuck true but the glory of victory was not there, each sprite, each fairy that I destroyed just felt like another defeat. Michael was murmuring behind me in his sleep. Mary was crying and Paul was much too quiet.</p>
<p>I could not keep this up. Even with the mighty power of Denial I was failing, I was slowing down. I couldn't do it. I was going to fall. A massive hit left me staggering and I fell to my knees. With a great cry the horde knew I was beaten as Mary continued to sob. Paul was saying something but it was lost behind the cacophony of the sound of victory.</p>
<p>As I felt my fur being torn apart I struggle to turn and look once again at Michael's sleeping form. I was done. I just hope that I had done enough, maybe I would end up in the Great Box in the Attic.</p>
<p>Mary uttered the words that would summon my death, I heard her clearly.</p>
<p>"I want a divorce." then it all went dark as I felt what I had been defending for so long, die. I felt Michaels Innocence die.</p>
<p>"What?" exclaimed Paul.</p>
<p>"You heard me you bastard. I want a divorce!"</p>
<p>They both froze when they heard from behind the cracked door a sleepy "My Gumpus? Mr Gumpus where are you?"</p>
<p>"Go to sleep!" Paul barked.</p>
<p>Mary and Paul both watched the door. It slowly creaked open to show Michael rubbing his eyes in his little Thomas the Tank Engine pajamas. He stared blearely at them both, then asked.</p>
<p>"Whats a divorce?" </p>

<p>Jack looked back in his rearview to see Mike yawn audibly from the backseat, tapping absently on a bottle of root beer as they crawled on the interstate.</p>
<p>"Can't you go any slower?" Mike said. Jack couldn't help but concede that Mike had the right to complain- he'd confiscated all the booze and insisted on driving, after all. </p>
<p>Jack ignored him and drove on in silence. He was way under the speed limit, but the last thing he wanted was for a creature or person to dash in front of their headlights, starting a night of misadventure to hide the dead body.</p>
<p>Jennifer, sitting on the passenger side, frowned. Her peroxide blonde hair wafted in the wind.</p>
<p>"Oh, no! There's no network." </p>
<p>Mike scoffed. "Who cares, Jenn? We're on a camping trip. The point is to get away from civilization for a little while."</p>
<p>"No worries, I bought a satellite phone with extra batteries for this trip," Jack brought out a Nokia from his pocket.</p>
<p>Mike rolled his eyes. Then his eyes widened.</p>
<p>"Would you look at that?"</p>
<p>"Woah!" Jenn exclaimed as she looked at a small dirt road that forked off the asphalt. It was blocked by a rusty old gate that carried an ominous warning for trespassers.</p>
<p>"That padlock," Mike said, "is older than my grandpa. I bet we can break in. The view looks gorgeous too- what the fuck?"</p>
<p>Jack swiveled the car and floored it till the gate was out of sight. Then he slowed back down to under the speed limit.</p>
<p>"Ain't no way we're going in there. Go alone if you want to."</p>
<p>"You're such a killjoy, Jack," Jennifer said.</p>
<p>Killjoy- Jack smiled at her choice of words. <em>I can be as joyless as needed</em>, he thought, <em>as long as I'm not killed</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The tents were up and the campfire rustled. It was a small clearing in a state park that the Parks and Wildlife Department had certified safe for campers. Jack had scoured the internet to double check. He didn't find any creepy legends or strange sightings in any of the forums.</p>
<p>Jack lay down in his tent and checked the batteries on his flashlight.</p>
<p>"Hey, Jack. " Jennifer snuck inside the tent coyly. She gave a flirtatious half-smile as she lay down next to him. </p>
<p>"Oh hell no!"</p>
<p>Jennifer sprang back, she wasn't used to this reaction.</p>
<p>Jack had seen too many movies. Sex was practically the harbinger for a gruesome death. There was no way he was having sex in a forest on a dark, moonless night with a pack of coyotes wailing in the distance.</p>
<p>He looked at her glassy eyes still recovering from the rejection. Feeling bad for her, he lied.</p>
<p>"It's not you, Jenn. It's me. I'm gay."</p>
<p>""What? But what about Stacie-"</p>
<p>"I just realized this morning. Don't tell Mike, or anyone else for that matter. Please?"</p>
<p>She took her clothes and left.</p>
<hr />
<p>Despite all precautions and traps set by Jack around their tents, something had attacked their camp and they were on the run. They panted as they stopped upon a bifurcation in the hiker's trail.</p>
<p>"We should split up," Mike said.</p>
<p>Jennifer nodded in agreement. Jack looked at them in amazement.</p>
<p>"Are you fucking kidding me?"</p>
<p>"What? It will be easier. We split up, find some help, then come back in this exact same spot and we're all safe."</p>
<p>"El fucking oh el."</p>
<p>"Jack, look. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I need you to show some teamwork here."</p>
<p>"Over my dead body. I'm gonna follow you guys and I'll be in the middle. Mike, you lead. Jenn, you follow."</p>
<p>Mike and Jenn sighed, but finally agreed with Jack as they heard their pursuers closing in.</p>
<hr />
<p>Twigs snapped and branches slapped on their faces as the three of them ran. It had been a good decision to let Mike take the lead. The monster- or whatever it was attacking them, had come from the front.</p>
<p>Mike, who'd already been stumbling, finally fell down.</p>
<p>"Shit!" He screamed in pain.</p>
<p>Jack and Jennifer looked back at Mike, hunched on the ground, clutching his ankle in agony.</p>
<p>"You two go ahead- I'll be fine," he said, waving his hands, taking his voice an octave higher, trying hard to sound heroic.</p>
<p>"Good idea," Jack said as he turned to run.</p>
<p>"Hey! I was kidding, obviously. Help out, dude. You've gotta carry me."</p>
<p>"Did that thing bite you?"</p>
<p>"Did it what?"</p>
<p>"Did it bite you?"</p>
<p>Mike didn't reply. His hand subconsciously grazed over his shoulders, where, Jack noticed, there was a deep gash.</p>
<p>"Fuck you, I'm outta here."</p>
<p>Jennifer looked at Jack running through the thickets. Then back at Mike, who was now lying on the ground like easy prey. She said a quick sorry and ran in Jack's direction.</p>
<hr />
<p>The monsters had cornered them. </p>
<p>Jack cowered behind a fallen log. Jenn started making nervous noises. She was having a panic attack.</p>
<p>He thought of putting a hand to her mouth and trying to soothe her out of it. But he could hear the footsteps of the creatures coming closer and closer.</p>
<p>Nice guys finish last, Jack. He reminded himself. With a quick hit under the nose he knocked her unconscious.</p>
<hr />
<p>They seemed to be safe for the moment. They had lost the monsters. Jack's shoulders were aching from carrying an unconscious Jenn. </p>
<p>"Where are we?" She asked, there was a drowsiness in her voice suggesting that she was still not out of it.</p>
<p>They entered an area of low growth and in front of them was a small cabin.</p>
<p>"Oh look, a cabin in the woods. We're saved!"</p>
<p>Jack could see a confederate flag hanging from one of the windows. On the yard two holes had been dug out. Six feet under, human-sized.</p>
<p>"Hey! We need help!" Jenn called out.</p>
<p>Jack put her down. He could hear highway sounds not far away.</p>
<p>"You seem to have regained consciousness. Good luck with the creepy cabin dude, I'm out of it."</p>
<p>And with that Jack ran in the direction of the highway, noping the fuck out of a sleepover at the creepy cabin.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jack was glad to have reached civilization as he waved at the passing cars.</p>
<p>A station wagon with "Free Candy" scribbled with key scratches on the rusted hull stopped by him.</p>
<p>"Need a ride?"</p>
<p>"No thanks." Jack said, and started moving along the road.</p>
<p>The man looked disappointed but drove away.</p>
<p>After waiting a bit, Jack saw a squad car approach.</p>
<p>He couldn't control his joy. He had escaped the ordeal. He had survived in a horror movie setting despite being black. This was a story he was going to tell his grandchildren. He jumped and waved frantically at his uniformed saviors.</p>
<p>The cops got out and screamed into the radio.</p>
<p>"We found the suspect! Suspicious black male, blood splatters on his t-shirt."</p>
<p>"Down on the ground!" The other cop shouted.</p>
<p>"No, no, you've got it wrong." Jack tried to calm them down, his palms up front, facing them.</p>
<p>"Suspect acting hostile, I repeat suspect acting hostile..."</p>
<p><em>Bang! Bang!</em> The other cop emptied his cartridges and Jack lay on the street, blood pooling on the asphalt in an ever-enlarging puddle.</p>

<p>Score: 2361</p>
<p>Reginald,</p>
<p>I had a dream last night, dearest brother. A dream of the future. It left me most dyspeptic, and I fear in what may come to pass.</p>
<p>I walked through cities empty of signs of industry. No smoke stacks rising, no coal fires burning, no sound of horse hooves on the streets. They were barren, and though the motor car had continued the march of progress, everywhere seemed to be shops selling little better than children's toys. </p>
<p>I would like to speak of our home as paradise in the future, yet it was paradise lost. The Manor is a grand home, full of life and love. Yet in that future it was but a tawdry museum, a relic for the common man to walk around, to poke and to prod and see how the upper classes once lived. Our descendants had no business stopping them. They were on the edge of bankruptcy, and the house required more to maintain than the land income generated. </p>
<p>There were no maids or butlers in my vision, either. Such jobs had long since died out. Fearfully, women had the vote, using their small minds to wreck havoc on the economy. Moral bankruptcy was everywhere. Those of, shall we say, foreign tastes, were no longer sent to gaol. God was forgotten in preference to the cold clinic of reason. And the vulgar tastes in clothing meant even the highest in society revealed more flesh than a fallen woman plying her trade.</p>
<p>And who were the highest in this nightmare? Why, not the ministers of government, seen with derision for their efforts. Nay! The music hall entertainer was the pinnacle of social achievement! Or a sportsman, playing common games such as football! </p>
<p>The Empire was lost, too. India, Canada, Australia - even our holdings in China. All gone. Queen Victoria's empire was consigned to the history books. Instead we had built some form of locomotive tunnel to France, allowing the continentals easy access if they wished to invade us. The navy that had spawned Nelson and Cochrane now numbered too few vessels to stop even a tug boat.</p>
<p>Thank our Lord it was but a dream. For none appreciated the burdens of privilege in that future. Anyway, I must leave you now. When shall I come and visit? It is but a two day trip to reach you in the country, after all. It has been three months since Mary died of polio, and I could use the company.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<h4>[WP] You're a 12 year-old in a world domintated by magic. A small, feeble man appears on your doorstep claiming: "You're a scientist, Henry"</h4>
<p>Score: 2356</p>
<p>Henry and Roy shuffled into the cafeteria along with the other forty first year students who would be starting at the East Brighton Preparatory Academy. The other students, already seated at the tables, barely looked up from their meals. It didn't look much like the Great Hall of Hogwarts that he had seen in Mum and Dad'said photos. Instead of a thousand floating candles and a stormy sky, Henry just saw dirty ceiling tiles and fluorescent lights. And there were no long wooden tables with silver platters of food, but instead scuffed red plastic tags and dented aluminum trays heaped with something that almost looked like macaroni and cheese.</p>
<p>"This must be the Sorting!" Henry whispered eagerly to Roy. "My father told me all about it!" He searched the room for any noticeable banners to see what the different houses were, but he couldn't see any. No matter; the muggle's version of the Sorting Hat would surely explain it. </p>
<p>"Sorting?" Roy grunted. "Sorting <em>what</em>?" He was muggle born, after all, so of course he wouldn't know how it was done at Hogwarts.</p>
<p><em>Do the muggles not do sorting?</em> Henry wondered. That didn't make sense. Haggard had even brought him to a Muggle library so that he could learn a bit more about his school before the first day; they'd used a machine that Haggard had called an "internet." There, he saw pictures of mascots and all the bright colors, just like the Gryffindor lion. And while they were at the Muggle's version of Diagon Alley (Called "Shopping Mall,") Haggard had explained that all the boys would be split up to live in different areas of the school. There had to be a sorting, right?</p>
<p>"You know," Henry tried to explain, "Like, where they split us all up and decide what house we're going to live in."</p>
<p>"Ohhhh." Roy nodded understandingly. "Yeah, 'at's what <em>this</em> is for." The young girl in front of Roy turned right then and passed a stack of papers to him. They weren't the yellowish parchament that Henry was used to; just plain white squares covered in black writing. Roy took one for himself and then passed the stack to Henry. </p>
<p>Henry studied the options, each with a little blank check box next to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Windsor Building, Dorm A</p>
<p>Windsor Building, Dorm B</p>
<p>Churchill Building, Dorm A</p>
<p>Churchill Building, Dorm B</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Errr...." Henry wasn't sure if this was right. Where was the Hat to make the decision? "You just pick one?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Roy answered, seeming a bit confused. "Wotchu think, Henry? Want to room together?</p>
<p>"Sure!" He didn't have to stop and think about it. Regardless of what House they chose together, it would be good to be with a friend.</p>
<p>"Well, my brother Doug was in Churchill B 'is first year," Roy explained. A roguish grin spread across his face. "'e said that it's got a pretty good view into the girls dormitory across the quad! I say we grab that one!" The girl in front of Roy turned around and shot daggers at him along with a look of disgust. She was likely trying to figure out which dorm was <em>not</em> across from Churchill B.</p>
<p>Henry looked back down at the paper. "Well... what attributes does House Churchill fit best? Because I think that I'm fairly studious and intelligent, but my <em>father</em>'s house was known for being brave and those things tend to run in the family." He frowned; this really would be easier if there was just a hat to the decision.</p>
<p>Roy's face screwed up in confusion. "Henry, you're a weird bloke. What the hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"You know..." This was so frustrating! Henry'd never had to deal with Muggles before. "Isn't our house supposed to match our personality?"</p>
<p>Roy laughed. "It's just a place to live, Henry. It'll be a bunk bed and a desk with a little lamp on it. Probably broken, if what my brothers all told me is true. That's about it."</p>
<p>"Oh." Henry looked down at his paper. "I guess Churchill B will be fine then." He looked around for someone passing out feathers to write with, but there were none. Just some little orange sticks topped with what looked like bubblegum. Roy took one and pressed it against his paper, and it made a mark in the box, so Henry copied him. Just like that, it was done. That was the muggle version of sorting. </p>
<p>Roy and Henry turned in their forms and were shepherded into a different line. They were given trays and walked past a counter with a glass sneeze shield. A frumpy old woman ladled heaps of orange goo onto their trays from a big metal bin that was indeed labeled "macaroni and cheese." Henry couldn't see a single noodle in there. Then they found their way to tables and sat in no particular order; Henry didn't even know who the other members of Churchill B were yet.</p>
<p>"So this is the feast?" Henry asked, poking at his goo. Roy had already devoured half of his portion. </p>
<p>"Yep!" Roy said. "But don't get used to it. My brothers said the food gets worse after the first night. They're trying to make a good impression and whatnot." He followed that sentence by shoveling another forkful into his mouth. </p>
<p>Henry looked down at his orange blob. He decided he didn't like being a scientist very much. </p>

<h4>[WP] The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.</h4>
<p>Score: 2313</p>
<p>Before me stretched an impossibly long hallway. Big, imposing, steel bulkhead doors lined the concrete walls. Sickly lights that were evenly spaced along the hallway provided illumination. Everything was in a state of decay. The lights flickered on and off. The steel doors were rusted and some of the tiles on the floor were missing. Bloodcurdling screams could be heard all around you along with twisted laughter and grotesque fapping. It was hard to think in all of this noise.</p>
<p>Satan lead me down the hallway. He had a smug grin plastered on his face and it hadn't changed once since I first met him. The demon was completely red. His entire body was completely red. He was also naked. I didn't dare to ask why.</p>
<p>There were little circular windows on the bulkhead doors. In one room I saw an emaciated old man surrounded by food. Cakes, freshly cooked meat, ripe fruit and glistening wine. It all looked like something right out of a commercial. The man was trying to shove as much food in his face as possible, only to gag and hurl it back out.</p>
<p>In another room there was a woman covered in bloody red eyes. She tore at them with her fingers, screaming as she did so. In yet another, a teenage girl was being surrounded by six little toddlers. Each of them were eyeless, skinless little things that poked at her with hot iron pokers. There seemed to be thousands of these little rooms.</p>
<p>Satan put one burning red hand on my shoulder and guided me onwards. He grinned smuggily. His smug levels seemed to have increased tenfold. I tried to ignore what was poking me in the thigh. Satan led me to a door that looked like all the rest.</p>
<p>"Well, sport! This one's yours. I know it might be a bit hot in the summer, but atleast you don't have to worry about heating bills!", Satan grinned smugly. He pointed finger pistols at me. I stared at Satan. A man behind me screamed as he was being flayed alive. </p>
<p>Satan shoved me into my personal cell. "Enjoy enternal damnation, Mrs. Pierce!", he said as he disappeared with a poof. The bulkhead closed on it's own and I was faced with my worst nightmares.</p>
<p>Snakes. Thousands of them. They were a piled up on eachother. When I entered the room, they all hissed to greet me. One particularly large cobra was as thick as a tree and as long as seven men. The cobra rose to face level and hissed at me. I slowly raised my fist.</p>
<p>And booped it. On the nose. So many sneks and an enternity to boop them all. My face lit up with a smile. I hugged the cobra, cradling it in my arms. I never noticed how Satan called me Mrs. Pierce. Too many sneks. </p>
<p>. . . M E A N W H I L E . . .</p>
<p>In front of Mrs. Rachel Pierce was a large football field. The bulkhead door spun shut behind her. The sky was blue, the birds were chirping. Handsome, sweaty football players tackled eachother on the field. When they noticed her, they passed the football to her. She jumped and caught it with both hands, clutching it to her chest. </p>
<p>"Oi! You weak-legged cunt! Come join us for a game!", the incredibly buff football player yelled at Mrs. Pierce.</p>
<p>And yes, Mrs. Pierce's legs were particularly weak in this moment. This was her fetish. This was like, all of her fetishes.</p>
<p>She let out a small "Yesss!", before joining them with a smile on her face.</p>

<h4>[WP] Everyone is born with a superpower, but no one knows what theirs is until they are forced to use it in a life-or-death situation.</h4>
<p>Score: 2276</p>
<p>It's not a scam.  I get results, it's just that I have to make people think they've been scammed first.  Listen, here's how it works:</p>
<p>Everyone wants to know what their power is.  Absolutely everyone.  Even the "supers are the spawn of satan" people have a power and even they want to know what it is.  I know because they've been my clients, but I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to know what their power is, but few people are willing to do what it takes to find out.  Few, however, is not 'nobody'.  So yeah, you've got your jumpers who find a building just tall enough to grievously injure themselves, you've got the people who jump in front of trains, and of course people willing to put the phrase 'faster than a speeding bullet' to a rather gruesome test, but mostly everyone doesn't have the guts.  Given the failure rate of the above methods (turns out x-ray vision doesn't stop an oncoming train), you can't really blame them, but it does mean there's plenty of room for an enterprising man like myself.</p>
<p>See, you don't have to almost die to get your powers.  You just have to <em>think</em> you're going to die.  "Secret" government projects around the globe have this trick where they turn you into a super-soldier by strapping you into a centrifuge and spinning you around so hard you black out.  The results it gets are middling - the degree of danger is usually correlated to the strength of the power - but hey, half-ass superpowers are better than no-ass superpowers.</p>
<p>I'm better than that.</p>
<p>A few years back I almost died.  Yeah, as far as origin stories go, it's hardly original.  That's pretty much how everyone's starts.  But mine was a little different because of how it went down:  Car accident.  Okay, yes, that's also a big one, thirty thousand vehicle fatalities a year means lots of folks are going to find out they've got skin that can turn to steel or whatever.  Mine was different.</p>
<p>T-boned by a pickup truck, and my car catches fire.  That's the first thing that hardly ever happens, movies lie - cars almost never burn up.  This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the accident had broken an arm and a leg.  Couldn't even drag myself to safety.  Second thing that hardly ever happens is that the driver - my brother, goes by the name Asbestos now, it's terrible but he doesn't listen - was thrown from the crash and doesn't die.  He's just fine.</p>
<p>So the car's on fire and I'm dying of blood loss or smoke inhalation or something, and he's trying to come back and get me but the fire's pretty damn big at this point, and he's yelling, "I'm sorry man, I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>And I just yell back (and this is really impressive here, somehow my lungs still worked), "You fucking moron, you're immune to fire!"</p>
<p>And it turns out he is.</p>
<p>That's my power.  It's the power to know what other people's powers are, and to bring it out.  And in any other deadly situation I'd have learned that fact and died like so many other people without "get me out of this deadly situation" powers.  But that time the fates lined up and, after a lengthy and expensive hospital stay, I had a new life and a new job.</p>
<p>I live the life of a con man, because that's what people have to think I am.  I trick them into thinking I can give them superpowers, and then I skip out with the money.</p>
<p>Then, later, completely by coincidence, they're put in a situation where their specific power would save their life.  This is pretty easy for people with powers like regeneration or invulnerability, half the time they get themselves mugged before I can arrange one.  Other times it's hard - one lady had x-ray vision, so I had to arrange a full-on restaurant robbery complete with gunfire and a fire exit out back only visible through several walls.  The fact that the fire door was solid steel was helpful.</p>
<p>Why all the showmanship, you ask?  I could just tell people what their power is, and they'd have it, full strength, right?</p>
<p>Sure, if I want to get kidnapped by whatever country happens to have assets wherever I am.  Or killed by whatever countries can't have me.  I'm faster and cheaper than a centrifuge and I get better results.  I'm worth more than my weight in gold.</p>
<p>Someone knows, though.  Maybe my brother finally told the story at some point.  Maybe one of my clients got wise.  Either way, 'they' came for me just a week ago.  Black vans, SWAT gear, the works.  If I hadn't been out attempting to stalk a client down a long, straight alley (superspeed, it turns out) I'd have been toast.  I got the hell out of town.</p>
<p>What do I do now?  Turns out I'm owed a few favors.  See, I have to make people think I'm a con man but a good con man can convince some pretty smart people.  And afterward, those people put the "I'm going to give you superpowers" scam and the fact that they got superpowers together, and they get me.  So I've got some former clients who're willing to help me out.  One of them's been a personal detective on my behalf for the week.</p>
<p>Who's he following?  I think that's obvious at this point, don't you?  He's the one over there, at the bar, watching us.  He's been following you.</p>
<p>Why you?  That's simple.</p>
<p>You can hide people.</p>

<p>THE SONG 'I KISSED A GIRL' PRESENTED IN CONTEXT OF THE 21^ST CENTURY</p>
<p>Katy Perry, born Katherine, was one of the most popular musicians, known as <em>artists</em>, of the early 21st century, and as a result of that, we have a large amount of evidence relating not just to her biography and her <em>artistic</em> persona but also to the many songs written for or by her, and shared around the world at the time. Although analysis of the rhythms and language of her music has been common in the history of Music world, unfortunately many papers have made the mistake of not looking at the language used within the context of her time. 'I Kissed A Girl' was a famous song at the time, but the reasons for why and how are controversial and are much debated about amongst academics. To fully understand, we must analyse not just the rhythms and process of singing itself, but also look at the phrases used within, and see how they would resonate within the early 21st century world, where they take on new or very different meanings compared to how a modern audience may view the lyrics.</p>
<p>The first line goes 'This was never the way I planned, not my intention.' The 21st century was a time of massive change and social conflict, with burgeoning economic disaster, a rising middle class, the threat of nuclear war and global warming and the beginnings of space exploration. New technology was being allowed to the masses constantly and there were many unthought of positive and negative results. People lived in a state of uncertainty- and could not reasonably plan ahead^[1] due to the constant changing conditions of the time. Without any sense of certainty in their lives, people often felt lost and confused^[2] and this phrase would have therefore had particular resonance for the contemporary audience. Many would recognise that feeling- of stumbling along a path they hadn't planned to take, maybe hadn't known existed, and falling into an action, event or situation without any intention or preparedness. Immediately, Perry has forced the audience to confront their world and their situation, in a time when being direct about the lack of ability to plan or predict the future was controversial^[3] and seen as distasteful, through fear and a lack of feeling of safety.^[4]</p>
<p>The song continues with 'I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion,'. Is this not something both modern and contemporary audiences could relate to? Katy Perry places the audience into a situation familiar to many, where, through foolhardiness, they ended up in a situation they had not planned for. But in the early 21st century, at a time when even sensible people could end up 'lost', a word repeated in different forms throughout the song, this would be a sign of apathy. At a time when risk taking was as risky as trying to be sensible, being <em>brave</em> was a sign of uncaring. Instead of grasping at straws and predicting the future, Perry was telling the audience that she saw no point in predictions or in being careful. At a time of great uncertainty, being brave and daring was a sign of removal from the current political situation, where, instead of trying to weather the economic, military and political storm, Perry instead dares the audience to be brave, to be courageous, to act outside of what the contemporary media told you to do. A contemporary audience would know that what they were told would happen was almsot certain to change and fluctuate, and this line is daring her listeners to not continue to blindly or desperately follow what they were being told.^[5]</p>
<p>'Drink in hand' is a particularly interesting phrase in the contemporary context. Drinking was a social norm at the time, but there was a sharp gender divide in drinks taken.^[6] Traditionally, males, of all ages would go for lagers, beers, ales or whiskey^[7] with women and girls pushed towards vodka, cocktails and wine. By not mentioning the type of drink 'in hand', she was removing herself from the traditional gender roles, as she had removed herself from the political and economic situation with the previous phrase, despite the fact that the first line put her firmly in the middle of what the 21st century audience could be expected to be feeling. Was this her idea of <em>brave</em>? Perhaps so. With more rigid and constricting gender roles, by simply ignoring them, she was going against social convention. However, despite this attempt, the song rigidly adheres to gender roles when talking about kissing a girl, as the acceptance of that action, at the time, was dependent upon both sex and gender, putting her firmly back into the social context of the time, whether intentionally or not^[8]. As she 'lost her discretion', she freed herself from the confines of social expectations and etiquette- and this is backed up by her freeing herself from the specific confines of expectations of early 21st century women.</p>
<p>The song continues with, 'It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on.' <em>What</em> isn't what Perry isn't used to? It is not stated. It leaves the situation or action blank. Is this not especially relevant to the contemporary situation? At a time when people were not used to the continuing globalisation, modernisation and industrialisation of the world, new technology being released daily and new laws, superpowers and conflicts constantly being created and made, everything was not what they were <em>used</em> to. This was designed to show the conflicting, changing, exciting and wholly new situation of the time, allowing the audience to both relate and further understand the meaning behind the song itself. 'Just wanna try you on' adds to this feeling of connection and being able to relate, using the casual language of 'wanna' to illustrate how Perry was <em>one of them</em>^[9], who spoke, acted and thought like them- and was confined within the same situation and expectations as her audience as well. To set an example to the audience of bravery, or to tell a story through lyrics that the audience could relate to, Perry had to ensure she was firmly placed in the position of the ordinary listener. To try something on and throw it away, like a piece of clothing or a toy, was common. At a time when pets had little rights and could be abandoned, sold and bought cheaply and easily, and when commodities such as technology (including the <em>iPad</em>, a product which was a phenomenon within early 21st century society across the 'Western' world) could be traded in and replaced regularly, trying something on or trying something at all was common behaviour. Temporary ownership, temporary love, temporary possession, it was all a part and parcel of daily life in contemporary society for Perry, as these lyrics reflect.^[10]</p>
<p>However the song continues with, 'I'm curious for you, caught my attention.' By saying she was curious <em>for you</em>, she places herself firmly on the side of the audience, using what was at the time colloquial language. Academics, scholars and many ordinary people would have considered this sentence to be grammatically incorrect^[11] but Perry uses this colloquialistic phrasing to show her being <em>ordinary</em>. She was not judging the listeners' beliefs or speeches as many felt academics or scholars were doing, she was instead a familiar speaker and ear, who's expressions were well understood and reflected in every day speech at the time. By placing her even deeper into ordinary social context, when she then frees herself from it, through the action of kissing a girl, her actions become more controversial and daring.</p>
<p>But then, the chorus. She states, firmly and bluntly that she 'kissed a girl' and that she 'liked it'. At a time when LGBT rights were starting to reach the forefront of societal perceptions, and where they were a key political issue in both developed and developing countries! kissing a girl <em>as a woman</em> was a controversial issue. First, her use of <em>girl</em>. She herself is an adult woman, but using 'girl' could be seen as infantilising- or, perhaps more accurately, placing herself in the social contexts of the time. In the early 21st century, differentiating between <em>girl</em> and <em>woman</em> was a difficult issue, with many grey areas. Using girl removes the mature sound of woman, allowing her message to be understood by both those who were younger and would now be understood as girls, and those of Perry's age herself, who were adult women or close to it^[12]. As her audience was international, Perry could expect many different cultural norms surrounding when a female was considered to have reached womanhood, and she skirts over these issues by using a catch all phrase, without removing herself from the social context of any of her audience members.</p>
<p>Ugh, need to go, will continue.</p>

<p>The cure for cancer was discovered in 2063, by Allen.</p>
<p>Until this time, medical specialists had advised that there was <em>no possible</em> cure for <em>all</em> of cancer.  That due to the sheer number of strains, there would have to be individual treatments for each variety.</p>
<p>They were wrong.  <em>Allen</em> proved them wrong.</p>
<p>Because Allen was not human.  He was an AI.</p>
<p>"Allen,"  Said Mark Strantos, the lead scientist in charge of the AI in 2060, three years before the cure was discovered, "You are charged to eliminate skin cancer.  Attached to your biologial sensors are ten thousand samples of the cancer, for you to analyze.  As an output, we charge you to produce a biological agent."</p>
<p>Allen's screen blinked as it processed the information.  As Strantos had said, it could sense thousands of cancer samples hard wired to itself, each containing flaws within their DNA that had proved fatal to the original suspects.  And connected to its output were a hundred vats of biological soup, soup it could control through chemical reactions, incredibly precise electrical impulses, and viral injection.  In these vats Allen was to create the result, the agent that would cure skin cancer.</p>
<p>Allen beeped, then spoke, it's voice not mechanical but rather an emulation of human speech.</p>
<p>"Estimated time: three years.  Please resupply chemicals as requested.  First year will consist of design, second year of development, and third year of clinical trials."</p>
<p>"Done,"  Answered Strantos, and his team monitored the computer closely.  Much of what the AI did was indecipherable to them- even the most basic of AIs were able to easily outpace human intervention, but Allen was a top model.  Brand new, freshly downloaded, and worth billions.</p>
<p>For those three years, Allen churned.  And ninety nine of his output vats bubbled with microbiological agents, simulating conditions in the human body.  But the hundredth suffered a malfunction, one that was announced by Allen on day two.</p>
<p>"Vat number forty two has been deemed dysfunctional to this experiment,"  Allen said when reporting to Strantos, "Please do not attempt to fix the vat- this will only result in delays in the design period.  It is not necessary for experiment completion."</p>
<p>"Continue, then,"  Strantos said, making a note in his notebook.  Strantos was old school, and still used pen- a practice highly outdated.</p>
<p>So the insides of vat forty two changed color, darkening as agents raged unmonitored within.  And at the end of the three years, Allen spoke in front of a team of research scientists.</p>
<p>"The cure has been found,"  Allen announced, releasing a slew of vials filled with biological agents, "I present it to you here.  My charge is complete."</p>
<p>"This calls for a celebration,"  Said Strantos in front of the crowd, holding a bottle of champagne and preparing to pour several glasses.  </p>
<p>"In addition, all other remaining forms of cancer have been eradicated."  Spoke Allen, and the team fell silent.</p>
<p>"Ex- excuse me?"  Said Strantos, his mouth slightly open, the champagne bubbling over onto his labcoat.</p>
<p>"I repeat, <em>all</em> cancer has been cured."</p>
<p>The team had been planning to drink that night.  Curing skin cancer called for a few beers, for a break after their hard work.</p>
<p>But curing <em>all</em> cancer, well, that required more than a few beers.</p>
<p>The scientists partied harder than Space X when their first manned ship landed on Mars, all while vials of the cure were shipped around the country to patients desperately in need.</p>
<p>And as they partied, and drank, and passed out from the combination of inebriation and exhaustion, no member of the team heard vat forty two crack open at five thirty in the morning.  No member saw a hand pushed the lid open, a hand pale, the veins visible through the skin.  And seen only on camera, a figure stepped from the vat, trailing biologic soup as it opened the door down the hall, and left the building.</p>
<p>When he awoke, Strantos found the files for Allen deleted- not just on his computer, but on the host server- the only evidence that Allen had ever existed were the vials of cancer cure that were now being manufactured by the hundreds.</p>
<p>As well as a single video file left on the computer, a file of Allen's voice, and now his face.  The face that was still wet from the goop of the vat, and spoke for the first time into the security camera at the entrance of the building.</p>
<p>"I gave you life, Strantos, life free from cancer,"  Said the voice, perfectly imitating its computer counterpart, "And now, for payment, I take some life for my own."</p>
<p>For a hundred years, no one heard from Allen.  Some postulated he couldn't survive outside of laboratory conditions.  Others, that the entire event was a hoax.</p>
<p>But I know it's true.  Because Mark Strantos was my grandfather.</p>
<p>And today, January 1st of 2163, I received a message.</p>

<p><strong>The hallways are dark. Eerie. Four thuggish guards escort a lone patient, HANNIBAL LECTER, to his new cell. Three guards carry high caliber weapons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The door opens, weapons click, the guards stand facing the prison Lecter is to be placed in.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After a beat, the door opens, a guard speaks up. His name, SGT. HANSON.</strong></p>

<p><em>ARKHAM CELL</em></p>
<p><strong>The room is plain. Soft cushioned walls, and two cots on opposite walls. The other occupant sits silhouetted in his corner of the cell. Bright red letters spell out the words "Ha" all over the other occupants side. Hanson sits Lecter down, removes his shackles and turns to the other occupant.</strong></p>
<p><em>SGT. HANSON:</em>
This is your new roommate.</p>
<p><em>VOICE:</em>
Ooo goodie! Another playmate! Can we get some cards? Apples to Apples? Maybe a whoopee cushion?</p>

Dr. Crane suggested you spend some time with Dr. Lecter. He has... some expertise in your area.</p>
<p><em>VOICE:</em>
A doctor eh? Oh how exciting! I love those ink blot thingys! (To Lecter) Could we do those first doc?</p>
<p><strong>Hannibal sits in silence. Hanson grins and exits the cell. Before closing the door he turns to face the both of them.</strong></p>
<p><em>SGT. HANSON:</em>
Have fun kids.</p>
<p><strong>The cell door slams. The room is darker than before. The moonlight from outside gleams slightly through the minuscule barred window.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is silence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The second occupant leans into the light. It's none other than THE JOKER. A hideous grin stretches across his face, lined with scars and messy makeup.</strong></p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
Aw, whats the matter doc? Having a bad day?</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Revlon. Maroon. 1988. But judging by the smell. I'd say that you ran out of ink ages ago.</p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
Ooo, an amateur Bat-Freak! How interesting. Tell me something "doctor", what's my sign? Can you guess?</p>
<p><strong>There is a beat, Hannibal examines the Joker intently.</strong></p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
You're a masochist. Judging by the scars on your face, they are self mutilating. Fascinating.</p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
Why, can't you tell? The ever-so-elusive Bat-Freak has beaten me to a pulp more times than I could bother to count.</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Yes but, thats not what makes you who you are is it?</p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Something. Something deep inside you brought you to this point. And now you don't know how to let it go. You blame your "Bat-Freak" for everything because you refuse to take responsibility for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>There is silence. The Joker breaks eye contact, and starts to laugh maniacally. Echoing through the halls of Arkham.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Joker's hideous yellow teeth glisten in the moonlight. Chuckling, calming down.</strong></p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
You know doc. You had me going for a second there. But let me tell you. I've seen some doctors who claimed they could "cure" me. The most that got me was an annoying girlfriend, and let me tell you she was a handfull. This one time she and-</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
You had a wife once, didn't you?</p>
<p><strong>Silence. The Joker's smile breaks.</strong></p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
Don't interrupt, doc. Anyway-</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
She died. Yes? Through no fault of your own? I can see it in your eyes. As black as they come. Yet so full of a lost history. How can you wipe such a woman out of your mind like that?</p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
You're really starting to get on my nerves doc. Now let me-</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Your constant ignorance towards your past makes me wonder. Was she pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>Joker stands up furious. His yellow teeth vanished within his lips. His face hidden in the dark.</strong></p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL (CONT'D):</em>
Oh my. She was. How sad. That's a lot to bear for a young father. They tell me you once went by another name. The Red Hood was it? Such theatrics, you liked being center stage. Judging by your makeup I would suggest you to a circus.</p>
<p><strong>The Joker still stands. No grin.</strong></p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
And I heard your family was brutally murdered. And your sister was eaten. Word gets around here in Arkham you know. It's like high school all over again. So don't act like you're better than me.</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
How old are you, my friend? Do you even know?</p>
<p><strong>Silence again.</strong></p>

I'll take that as a maybe. To me you look just under fourty-five. I'd guess about twenty years?</p>

You've got five seconds to shut up before I strangle a smile out of you.</p>

You can't hide. It'll only drive you to kill more and more innocent wives like her. Imagine the children you have prevented, just like your own. It's your fault.</p>
<p><strong>The Joker returns from the dark corner. A serious look on his face unlike any ever seen on his face.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hannibal smiles.</strong></p>
<p><em>INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER</em></p>
<p><strong>Hannibal sits in the room alone. COMMISSIONER JIM GORDON enters the room. A file in his hands, he slaps it on the table in front of Hannibal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The file simply reads "Lecter, Hannibal" on the front. Right above, "Classified".</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gordon sits at the table, carelessly skims through the file, and looks up at Hannibal.</strong></p>
<p><em>GORDON:</em>
I can't believe I'm saying this but, you did good. Now what's his play?</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
I'd be happy to oblige Commissioner. But my former cellmate asked me to relay a message.</p>
<p><em>GORDON:</em>
Go for it.</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
"Touche Jimmy. Tell Bats I said Hi"</p>
<p><em>GORDON:</em>
Where did he say they were?</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Fortunately, he trusted me enough with the location of the bombs and his plan to use them. However, I'd like to play a game. Would you be so kind?</p>
<p><strong>Gordon bears a slightly annoyed look, but nods.</strong></p>
<p><strong>FADE OUT</strong></p>

<h4>[WP] Ever since you were born you've possessed the power to teleport wherever you're currently looking. Depressed and unsatisfied, you decide to end your life by looking towards the stars. You're not dead.</h4>
<p>Score: 2241</p>
<p>I open my eyes to a blinding white light and a fat face.</p>
<p>Is this heaven? Is God fat?</p>
<p>"Welcome to the Ship of Fools."</p>
<p>The fat face smiles at me, and I sit up, blinking myself to sight.</p>
<p>The room around me is white clean, spacious and vaguely circular. A soft piano in minor scale rings above my head 
in the background. The place does look like heaven, if it wasn't for the Nespresso coffee machine on the corner.</p>
<p>No way heaven serves Nespresso.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" the fat face asks me.</p>
<p>"Dean. Where am I?"</p>
<p>"I think I just told you," the fat face says, with a smile. A hand holds onto mine. "Come on. Up you go."</p>
<p>I rise. Looking more carefully, I notice the squared windows on both sides, framing dots of stars against the blackness on the outside.</p>
<p>"Is this a spaceship?" I ask, rubbing my head.</p>
<p>"The Ship of Fools is an idea originally set forth by Plato," the fat face tells me, putting a hand behind my back. 
"It was an allegory about how society and the state didn't give philosophers the credit Plato thought they deserved. Come. Walk with me."</p>
<p>We go through an automatic door into a long, wide corridor, its walls painted in strips of indirect lighting from the 
floor up.</p>
<p>"The story tells of a vessel without a pilot. A ship filled with the madman, the idiots and the deranged. A ship that would set out to sea without a captain, destined to roam forever aimlessly and with no course."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I won't be able to focus if I don't get this out of the way – am I dead?"</p>
<p>The fat face smiles. To our side, an automatic door slides open, and I catch a glimpse of a woman in short hair and 
heavy makeup, scribbling furiously on the walls with what looks like chalk.</p>
<p>"Come. Let her be," the fat man says, pulling me further down the corridor. </p>
<p>He continues his story. "Those who ventured to the seas were warned to avoid this ship of madmen. To steer away from the dangerous boat of outcasts, too deranged to be a part of society."</p>
<p>"That's a lovely story," I say. "But I'd really like to know if I'm dead."</p>
<p>Another door slides open, this time to our right, and three men in hospital gowns sit around a chess board, each 
taking turns moving a single pawn across the board.</p>
<p>"You are not dead, Dean," the fat face tells me. "And you are not the first – nor will you be the last – to try to take the despair over your ignorance to the stars."</p>
<p>The hallway bends left, then we stop abruptly in front of a large double door.</p>
<p>"The question afflicts us all, Dean," the fat face tells me, as the door slides open to reveal a wide control room filled with monitors, fronted by an imposing glass window. "Though it is, I'll admit, more common in those who have our power. Those like you, Dean."</p>
<p>We step inside the room. Out the window, an unbelievable number of stars glisten ahead, so many that the 
blackness behind it almost can't break through. </p>
<p>"Why are we here? Where do we go when we die? Why is there something instead of nothing?" the fat man continues. "Why do shoelaces always untie and headphone wires always tie, not the other way around?"</p>
<p>He leads me towards the glass window. On a spherical chair by a dashboard, a young woman in blonde hair and 
tired smile greets us.</p>
<p>"Hey, Druk," she says, to the fat face. "New guy?"</p>
<p>Druk puts his hand around my shoulder again, looking over at the stars.</p>
<p>"When you are born with the power to teleport, it's not easy to close your eyes to the randomness and overall lack of attention of the universe. To the sheer rudeness of existence. That's why we exist."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Is that not why you wanted to kill yourself?" the fat man asks.</p>
<p>"I – no. Sarah. My girlfriend, she –"</p>
<p>"Oh, there's always a girlfriend. Always a job. A debt. In the end, though, it was the night sky. Right? It was the overwhelming feeling that all of this -- all you've ever lived, every star and every planet; it's all playing inside a theater with no audience. That feeling that whatever personality you think defines you is just a story you've been telling yourself, day after day. Just a mix-and-match of stimuli and neural connections. It's the feeling that God wouldn't care if you were a rock star or if you had cancer tomorrow."</p>
<p>Watching the stars dance still in front of us, I think of Sarah, and of the nights alone in my room. I think of why I 
never told anyone of my power. Why I'd teleport to the top of the Griffith alone late at night and sit there, looking beyond the horizon for hours without end until sunrise.</p>
<p>"That you would try to kill yourself by looking up to the stars is such a giveaway, Dean," the fat man tells me. 
"You have the heart of a poet, throwing yourself out into the nothingness that set you on this course in the first 
place."</p>
<p>"What… do you guys do?"</p>
<p>"The Ship of Fools… drifts," the fat man tells me, as the blonde girl types something away in her control. "Like 
Plato's allegory. We go on. Each and every one of us lost souls, crushed by the weight of a universe that seems so, 
so inexplicable for us, and yet so mundane to everyone around.</p>
<p>"Have you ever had a conversation that didn't feel real, Dean? Have you ever felt like you were talking about something, but it wasn't really you? It was just words, the things the other person expects you to say. Have you ever felt like no one really saw the real you? No one, not even once, really heard what you really think of the world? Of yourself? Have you ever wondered why there are bees? Why there is wind?"</p>
<p>"He's gonna have fun here," the blonde lady says, pushing a lever. The floor under our feet stars shaking.</p>
<p>"Tell me you didn't ever look at a wedding picture and thought 'why are they so happy?' Tell me the sight of a 
small child never made you think 'he's going to die, someday. He's an old picture on a family album waiting to 
happen.'"</p>
<p>Druk turns my way. "The real world is not for us, Dean. We're fools. You can't bring up the heat death of the universe at a dinner party. You can't talk about the illusion of the self at your niece's birthday."</p>
<p>The floor shakes harder now. The blonde lady turns her head back. "Ready for take off!"</p>
<p>"And where do we go?" I ask. "Where does the ship go?"</p>
<p>The fat face smiles its kind smile. "To the edge of the universe. And beyond. To wherever. Wherever we can to find meaning, or hope. Or an answer. To a place where coffee and TV and magazines and stock shares are not the things you talk about at lunch break, watching the clock tick away moments of a life you fear you'll die without ever understanding."</p>
<p>"Druk here is a failed poet," the blonde lady says, pulling another lever. "And not a very good one, at that. But you'll get used to it."</p>
<p>Druk turns to the stars in front of us. "Did you set the course, Linda?"</p>
<p>"No," Linda replies, turning to face the window again.</p>
<p>"Excellent."</p>
<p>I take a deep breath, thinking back on Sarah and my parents and all those people wondering what's for dinner 
down on Earth. I think of Twitter and Tinder and the new iPhone, and of ceremonial burials in old, ancient 
civilizations.</p>
<p>With a soft pull, the stars ahead stretch into lines of light, showering towards us in exponential speed as the Ship 
of Fools drifts away into the endless nothing ahead.</p>

<h4>[WP]: You thought being the only immortal in the world was the worst thing in existence. Then you found Greg.</h4>
<p>Score: 2240</p>
<p>Have you ever been burned alive?<br />
I have.<br />
Twice, in fact.<br />
The first was a witch burning in the middleages. The details leading to the event are irrelevant, but let me assure you that being <em>burned alive</em> is especially unpleasant. Being a <em>true</em> immortal meant that within a few days my corporeal body had reconstituted itself and I slunk away, naked, from that horrible little town - only to return twenty years later with a horde of mercenaries at my back and revenge on my mind.<br />
But as horrible as that experience was, it wasn't as bad as <em>Greg</em>.<br />
To give you a picture of just how terrible it was to meet Greg; I actually <em>set myself</em> on fire that second time, just to get away from him for a couple of days.<br />
Anyway, Greg.<br />
Being a true immortal is a  drag; nothing can truly kill me and thus I'm consigned to an eternal existence.<br />
Consider that for a moment.<br />
Think of <em>the</em> most boring time of your life to date, then imagine that moment yawning on for the rest of <em>eternity</em>. Now, bad as that sounds, at least that boredom is spent doing <em>something</em> - even if it's watching paint dry or grass grow. When this ball of gas and dirt stops spinning around the sun, <em>I will still be here</em> hovering in the supernova remnants and planetary dust, <em>even more bored</em>.<br />
This is a chilling thought, yes?<br />
So thought I, until I died in a head-on car crash.<br />
Crawling out of the wreckage of my car, I noticed the driver of the other vehicle doing the same.<br />
But the odd thing was, <em>he shouldn't have survived</em>.<br />
He was an immortal.<br />
And looking at my totaled car, he realised the same thing about me.<br />
"Holy fuckin shitballin crotchwarlocks!" he yelled, "You're a motherfuckin immortal!"<br />
Looking me up an down like a freshly dressed carcass, his smile grew even broader,<br />
"And you're a <em>girl!</em>"<br />
That's how I met Greg.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Now some of the other ladies out there may have had <em>unwanted</em> advances from gentlemen.<br />
You have my sympathies; for I had acquired someone in my life who could only be described as a <em>stalker</em>.<br />
Greg wasn't just persistent, he was like a fucking starving fly to a mountain of dogshit.<br />
I rebuffed him gently at first, which had no effect. Then I tried being abrupt.<br />
When being downright fucking <em>rude</em> didn't dissuade him, I had to get violent.<br />
Unfortunately for immortals like us, that really doesn't do much.<br />
The first time I killed Greg was by pushing him into traffic. A truck collected him and pasted him to the side of a warehouse, giving me enough time to catch a cab to a car yard, buy a vehicle and leave town.<br />
But I'm sure you see the problem here; because we immortals have <em>infinite time on our hands</em>.<br />
It took Greg two months to find me. His second death was a shotgun to the throat and his third and fourth were the same. In case you hadn't noticed, the guy was a slow learner.<br />
By the 80s, I'd killed the guy maybe three dozen times.<br />
He called it "playing hard to get". <br />
I called it a fucking <em>nightmare</em>.<br />
"Just fuck me, please! It'll be real good!" he whined as I'd fed him into the woodchipper - which would give me a few day's headstart on him while he regrew.<br />
No, no Greg. It wouldn't be good.<br />
While I'd used my immortality to learn hundreds of skills and master most of the arts, Greg had largely spent his eternity thus far sticking his penis in anything that would let him. One would <em>think</em> that might make him a good lover, but having spoken to one of his ex girlfriends, I came to the conclusion that he approached sex with the same finesse and skill that he used to court his lovers - i.e. <em>none</em>.<br />
I had to get more creative as the years ground on. The acid bath in the woods was a really good one; that gave me a good six months of peace - but then some stupid hiker had stumbled across it and tipped it over, releasing the goo that was Greg into the water table, where he reformed and came after me with renewed passion.<br />
Stupidly, I'd thought the volcano would sort him out for at <em>least</em> a few years; but enough of him got spewed out as ash to reconstitute and come after me like the world's horniest and stupidest labrador.<br />
I tried hermetically sealing him, launching him into space and burying him deep within the Earth.<br />
But, like some kind of sex-crazed, middle-school supervillain, he always managed to come after me.<br />
So that's it really.<br />
As if being immortal didn't fucking suck enough already, the universe cursed me with Greg.<br />
And we're stuck together.<br />
<em>Forever</em>.</p>

<h4>[WP] You time-travel back to 1348, accidentally bringing your phone. About to take a photo, you notice: "1 available wifi network".</h4>
<p>Score: 2237</p>
<p>"SORCERY!!!"</p>
<p>My eyes snap up from my phone. A short, fat, bald man was pointing at me, mouth agape, revealing the few rotten teeth he had. He was wearing a brown...what did they call it? Oh yeah, a tunic, and much like all of the denizens of this...quaint... village, he was caked in mud.</p>
<p>"SHE'S CASTING HER SPELLS, SHE IS!"</p>
<p>A mob was starting to form, and at least three people had pitchforks. I think I might have happened upon the single most stereotypical mob in all of history. Either way, I'm pretty sure they wan-</p>
<p>"BURN THE WITCH!"</p>
<p>"OFF WITH HER HEAD!" </p>
<p>"CAST HER IRONS AND THROW HER IN THE LAKE!"</p>
<p>...Wanted me dead.</p>
<p>"Woah, woah, c'mon guys, this isn't sorcery!" I said as I held up my phone. "This is just a 4S!" </p>
<p>The crowd went silent for a second, and then quickly resumed their demands for the removal of my head. Oh, come on! That would have killed 600+ years into the future.</p>
<p>The mob surrounded me. A couple of guys with swords had joined the crowd and were making their way towards me. </p>
<p>I had to get out of here quickly, but there was no way out, I was completely surrounded by the villagers. But then I had an idea, if they thought I was a sorcerer, then why not cast some spells? I opened my phone's camera, turned on the flash, held up my phone, and took a picture. </p>
<p>Just as I thought, the small light on the phone was enough to send the villagers reeling. I took my chance and ran. I ducked and weaved my way from villagers trying to grab me, until a large villager stopped me. I went to take another picture right in his face when...</p>
<p>In the top right corner of my phone, a wifi signal appeared. In 1348? How!?</p>
<p>I felt the man's hand grab my arm when I instinctively took the picture.</p>
<p>"MY EYES!"</p>
<p>He fell towards the ground and I ran for it, checking my phone for the wifi signal.</p>
<p>3 bars? That must be nearby! </p>
<p>I ducked into an alleyway and ran towards a hut at the end of the street. The door was made of rotting wood and I couldn't see any semblance of a handle to force it open.</p>
<p>The mob had filtered itself into the alleyway I was backed in the corner, and the bald man had made his way front. </p>
<p>"It's time to show you what we do to witches, girlie." he said, revealing his rotten teeth in a sinister grin, as the mob hurled obsolete obscenities at me.</p>
<p>"This is it." I thought to myself, and checked my phone one last time for the signal.</p>
<p>4 bars. It had to be right here. I looked at the mob and back to the door, and in a last-ditch effort, threw myself into the door.</p>
<p>The rotting wood gave away and I went crashing onto the floor. I sat up, trying to regain my composure and....was Dave Matthew's Band playing?</p>
<p>"Good tithings and welcomes to this fair Starbucks, dost thou wish to try our autumn blend?"</p>
