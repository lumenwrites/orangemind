<h4>[WP] A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rouge planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".</h4>
<p>Score: 3889</p>
<p>The house was filled with tears of sadness, joy and laughter. Long hugs, intense and heartfelt kisses, jokes to cheer up the inevitability of a saddened mood. Chris sat on the couch, surrounded by his friends and his family, and he couldn't but smile. The melancholy of the situation weighed on him, and yet there was this feeling that he couldn't shake off. ''If we have to go, then this is a pretty decent way of going.''</p>
<p>The crash of the two planets had been predicted to happen at 5:55AM EST, 25th October 2015. The planet had come in NASA's sights roughly a month ago, and from that moment on everything changed.</p>
<p>There was of course an uproar. People panicked, immediately thinking the world was about to end. It was 2012 all over again, with mass conspirators claiming they had seen it coming and that the USA, the UN or the lizard people were the cause of it. The closer we got to 31th since that moment, the more the average people started to dread. The governments kept people updated, but after a while the impending doom was wide-spread. ''If they would've been able to do something about, they would've, by now'' was the train of thought most people had. And when the rocket launches NASA did failed and didn't alter the planet's course for five times, people lost hope.</p>
<p>Since that moment some people died, thinking it was better to take fate into own hands. Others got careless with drugs and died by overdose. The others just kept going. Irrelevant jobs were abandoned, but luckily a large amount of people volunteered to keep doing the important jobs like rail roads and food supply for that last month.</p>
<p>All the people who were still with us on this 24th day of October had accepted whatever was coming from them. Chris had too. What other choice did he have? It was not like he could do anything about it. He didn't have the knowledge, nor the time.</p>
<p>Chris drifted off, knowing he would be woken if anything important was to happen. He woke up, hours later, in a dead silent room. His heart jumped, his sight still foggy from his deep slumber. Did he miss it? Was it over already? Of course not. Why would I be alive then? Wait? What if we survived? He rubbed in his eyes to regain vision. He looked around.</p>
<p>Nothing moved. Absolutely nothing happened.</p>
<p>''Hello? People?''</p>
<p>No reaction. Not a sound, not a movement, not a blink of an eye. </p>
<p>And then a sharp pain in his forearm. He looked down and saw a smear of blood. ''What the hell?'' Chris shouted while he shot up from the couch. Holding his breath he walked to the sink confused and cleared up the blood with a splash of water. As he dried it with a paper towel, he could read an etching engraved into his arm. It already had the faded pink color of a scar gotten long ago, and it read:</p>
<p>''No matter how long it takes, save us.''</p>
<p>Chris exhaled.</p>

<h4>[WP]Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?</h4>
<p>Score: 3206</p>
<p>So get a load of this. I had this idea.  I was thinking, how am I going to kill one of the most antagonistic political figures of the 20th century? <br />
I thought, hey, a sperm whale--- <br />
It started with a sperm whale anyway. I was just going to drop a <em>sperm whale</em> on him. Then I realized, I wasn't going to get points just for subtelty or difficulty. <em>Anyone</em> can drop something on someone. Hell, the third winner used an ambulance. Points for creativity <em>and</em> irony that year. <br />
Then, I figured it out. An <em>homage</em> to the old days of this noble sport. <br />
So I went back to a further time, earlier in the era. Found this old man, and asked him what he thought of some paintings I brought with me. <br />
Here's where we pick up the pace.   <br />
I asked him about <em>Adolf Hitler's</em> paintings. He thought out loud as old men always do (even in the 20th century!) and said, he never heard of him, but the painting technique was "disappointing."<br />
Then I asked him to repeat himself, and say, "Adolf Hitler's art, was disappointing."  <br />
So he did.<br />
I asked him to <em>yell</em> it, tell all who would hear a master's opinion of this work. <br />
<em>JUST</em> as he was about to respond, I teleport him over Hitler making a public speech in Berlin three decades later. You can see this old man <em>zooming</em> down into the sky. In the tape, you can barely see Hitler raise his eyebrows. <em>That's</em> when he realizes someone was yelling his name from above.<br />
You have no idea how difficult it was calculating the <em>exact</em> velocity to get the old man's adrenaline going, give him time to speak, and have Hitler hear him.<br />
And there! That's how I pulled it off.<br />
I killed Adolf Hitler by dropping his painting idol, Rudolf von Alt, far above his head, <em>while</em> he was yelling out his opinion of Hitler's paintings for all of Berlin to hear. It was the last thing he ever heard.  <br />
And Rudolf called his paintings <em>crap!</em><br />
The bonus points for intricacy <em>and</em> emotional devastation got me the victory.    </p>

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 2483</p>
<p>“So where are ya heading?” Jim asked, his turning down the secluded dirt road. It was his favorite spot for murdering thus far. Granted, it may have also been his only one thus far...</p>
<p>The woman had hardly said a word since he picked her up. She seemed bored, constantly staring out of her passenger window. It was all wrong. He liked to get them comfortable before doing the deed.</p>
<p>“Just the bus station,” she said.</p>
<p>“Really?” Jim raised an eyebrow. “What’s a pretty little miss like you needing to ride a gross bus for?”</p>
<p>“My mother’s in the hospital.”</p>
<p><em>Shit</em>, he thought. <em>It’s okay. Deep breaths, you can fix this.</em></p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Jim said with faux concern. He checked his gas light. The red light had flashed long enough. Just a little bit more…</p>
<p>Like an answer to his prayers, the truck began to sputter. It shook, the arrow on the speedometer slowly descending to zero. He frowned, hoping the woman wouldn’t see glee behind his mask. He didn't want to make her nervous. </p>
<p>“Dammit,” Jim barked as he banged on the steering wheel. “I’m out of gas. We’ll have to pull over.”</p>
<p>The woman shrugged, silent as ever. Something about her gesture made Jim nervous. He had never seen a hitchhiker look so indifferent. Yet, he liked it. She was his first true challenge.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jean stood to the side as Jim fiddled with the oil pan of his car.</p>
<p><em>He really is a moron, isn’t he? People are usually a little suspicious of hitchhikers but he’s treating me like a long lost friend. Shame, since I’ll be slitting his throat any moment now.</em></p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Jim called, breaking her thoughts.</p>
<p>Jean blinked, turning in his direction. The man had a goofy grin as he looked back at her, a streak of grease on his cheek. <em>A true idiot</em></p>
<p>“What?” she asked, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>“Well, I was wondering if you could give me a little help over here. It’s a tad complicated.”</p>
<p>“Putting gas in your car is complicated?”</p>
<p>“I never said I was a mechanic”</p>
<p>Jean sighed, walking over to help the dimwitted man. The closer she got, the more she noticed something… <em>off</em> about him. His demeanor, the way he hid a hand behind his back. She had practiced the same thing a thousand times before. It was a ploy - a bad one at that.</p>
<p>“What the fuck?” Jean furrowed her brow, backing away. “You have a knife, too?”</p>
<p>“What?” Jim began to sweat profusely. He wiped his forehead, revealing the gleam of a butcher’s cleaver in his closed fist. “Ah shit, wrong hand. But it's not what it looks like. I just keep this to check the fuselage and… wait, did you say ‘too’?”</p>
<p>Jean reddened, pulling her jacket closer to her body. The chilling sensation of the blade's flat side brushed against her side. So much for keeping her weapon a secret.</p>
<p>“Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t,” she started. “What’s it to you?”</p>
<p>Jim smiled, still cheery but different. Somehow more pleasant.</p>
<p>“You’re the Hitchhiking Murderer!” he said. “I’ve heard about you while watching TV. I must say, I’m a fan of your work.”</p>
<p>Jean stood flustered. “I… uh, thank you?”</p>
<p>“Jim Miller,” the man extended his hand. “I’m still new to the scene but I guess you could say I’m your opposite. I like to kill hitchhikers, rather than be one. I'll tell you, I never thought we’d cross paths this way. You’re even more beautiful than the rough sketches of you on the ten o'clock news.”</p>
<p>Jean blushed. <em>He can’t be serious.</em></p>
<p>“Thanks,” she paused. “So, are you not going to try and kill me?”</p>
<p>Jim shrugged. “I guess not. We don’t have to compete in the same pool for our victims so there’s no need to be territorial, right?”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>“So it’s settled.” Jim smiled. “We’re cool.”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Jean backed away, her eyes still glued to Jim's knife. He appeared friendly but if she learned anything, it was she couldn’t take chances. Yet, something told her he would stick to his word. He may have been a killer, but he was the earnest type.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she said, standing on the edge of the forest. Her voice echoed in the brisk night air as Jim perked his head up in anticipation of her words. “Next time, don’t make it so obvious that you’ll run out of gas. I could see you glancing at the meter every few seconds. And for the love of Christ, don’t show your knife until you’re about to kill someone. It's reeks of amateurishness. Don't give a bad name for the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Jim nodded, giving her a thumbs up. “You got it! Maybe one day, I’ll show you how much I’ve improved. I'll earn my name as an established serial killer and make you proud.”</p>
<p>Jean fought back smiling herself. <em>Stupid as ever</em></p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said, melting into the safety of the foliage. “Maybe one day.” </p>

<h4>[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.</h4>
<p>Score: 2126</p>
<p>"Your seventh child is going to kill you," the witch said as I finished my drink with her.</p>
<p>"Seventh?" I asked. She nodded, and her tangled hair fell over her eyes. Margaret was an interesting character. She hung out around the bar and fancied herself a witch.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said, "had a vision last night, sucks don't it?"</p>
<p>"Well you aren't wrong there," I said, if I had children I'd be freaking out."</p>
<p>She looked from her glass and then to me, "you don't?"</p>
<p>"No, never found the lady."</p>
<p>"Well if you do, just make sure you don't have seven."</p>
<p>"Will do Margaret."</p>
<p>Three years later Margaret and I were married. Despite her unusual views on pagan gods, she was wonderful and the love of my life. The more interesting part of her, though, was the fact that she was literally a witch. I couldn't deny it once I saw the cauldron that could let her see anyone in the city at any time. </p>
<p>Three years and seven days later Margaret and I were sitting in planned parenthood. We didn't want to birth deadly children, but I'd fucked up. The visit was more about caution than coathangers, but it was still a visit. Which meant that I still saw Lisa.</p>
<p>Lisa was a blonde woman that I hadn't met before this day. She walked up and swore that she knew me from somewhere. We had talked for a while before I put my glasses on and it clicked for her. I had been her sperm donor for her artificial insemination. I looked at her with wide eyes and then to Margaret.</p>
<p>"How could you forget that you were a sperm donor?" she asked as we walked back from planned parenthood. We were eating ice cream, I was a vanilla person, and she liked black licorice for its name.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a big deal at the time," I said, "I did the shit for the twenty bucks and the cute girl at the counter."</p>
<p>"You flirted with someone by whacking it in the room beside them?" she asked. I still considered it flawless logic. She shook her head, "we are going to the clinic and getting a list of your children." </p>
<p>"I think that's against some privacy laws."</p>
<p>"Being a witch should get me burned and you still love me," she said. Margaret too a lick of her ice cream and then bit into it. "Don't be a pansy about it, illegal is nothing."</p>
<p>"All right," I said, and we went to the clinic.</p>
<p>Three spells later we had somehow managed to get all of the released information about my children. Most of them were names and some birth addresses, but we were told it was incomplete information. We didn't have days. </p>
<p>"You have 42 children?" Margaret asked as she looked over the paper.</p>
<p>"Are you impressed?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Terrified," she answered, "and you're a fucking idiot. Do we know who number seven is?"</p>
<p>"No birthdates, but they shouldn't be older than fifteen now anyway."</p>
<p>"Fifteen is the perfect age for father killing!" she said a little too loud in the middle of the street, "your magic blood will be potent in them by then! Who know's what they will do?" for the first time in my life I saw Margaret's eyes waver.</p>
<p>"FATHER!" a scream came from the other side of the street, "I hope you are prepared! I am your first seventh child!" I looked toward the voice and saw a little waif of a brunette carrying a sword, "prepare for your reckoning!" she screamed, and her sword went ablaze. Fuck.</p>
<p>"We weren't done talking about this," Margaret said as she raised a hand. Within a second the girl tripped and fell. She ended up beside her sword and caught on fire. I watched in horror as she burned.</p>
<p>"Do what you want father!" she screamed while also screaming, "when I die the eighth shall be seventh! One of us will drink your blood!" she yelled before she stopped screaming. Death calmed her down.</p>
<p>"Oh god dammit," Margaret said beside me, "I only have so many luck curses, and I don't think all of them are going to be stupid enough to have a flaming sword."</p>
<p>"What are we going to do?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I have no idea," she said, "but it's probably going to take years."</p>

<p>My plane is delayed. Don't you hate it when that happens? </p>
<p>It is some sort of mechanical failure, the pilots say. You'd think that the Prime Minister's plane would be maintained in immaculate condition, wouldn't you? They shouldn't be discovering these things right as I'm jetting off to the EU summit with the Russian Federation concerning the state of Crimea. The UN-administered regime of independence for the region has been an utter failure. Instead of creating a stable buffer between Europe and Russia, it's only led to civil warfare. But I'm pushing to end it once and for all.</p>
<p>I've been on the front lines of this conflict, both as a platoon leader during Britain's first intervention in 2051, and as a politician in Parliament urging for greater action against the Russian-backed rebels. I railed against our former Prime Minister's weak response, as well as the pitiful attempts of the EU Expeditionary force. And I did such a good job of it that my own Independence Party won a majority in Parliament only this past year. And, using my newfound political clout, I was able to convince our Russian counterparts to join us for a peace meeting in Tel Aviv. Israel has done a fine job of staying neutral despite sharing a border with the EU's Turkish territory.</p>
<p>After an hour on the tarmac, my plane is finally able to take off. We soon reach a cruising altitude, and I check my watch. The EU President and Foreign Minister should have landed already with their gaggle of Presidents and Prime Ministers in tow. They'll be whisked away to the summit without even checking into the hotel. The limousines will arrive at roughly 2:30, and the bombs are set to detonate at 2:45 in the midst of the scheduled press conference kicking off the summit. Russia's counterpart will also be <em>conveniently</em> delayed, sparing them from the carnage as well. Naturally this fact will be held up later as proof of their guilt.</p>
<p>Oh, did I not mention that I'm the reason the plane had mechanical problems? That it's all a deliberate ruse to make it look like I should have been a victim (to gain sympathy in the press) while simultaneously ridding me of those ninnies from the peace bloc who'd prefer to work things out with words? That it will soon be revealed that Russian operatives were the culprits of the bombing? It's the perfect Casus Belli.</p>
<p>We've barely made it over the Channel, and I'm already bored. God, I hate flying. My foot taps the plush carpet impatiently, waiting for the news. It's 2:46 already. What's taking so long? I pull out my notepad, ready to get to work. Even though I can't be seen preparing my speech before I've even received news of the 'tragedy,' there's nobody else in the plane. The pilots won't know what I'm working on here, so they won't be suspicious. And I do want to get a jump on it. After all, it needs to be convincing enough to make the right case. That this tragedy cannot go unanswered, and that I am the man to lead the EU to victory. I'm the only one with the political clout, the military experience, and most importantly: the resolve to see it through. Perhaps I ought to channel Churchill. </p>
<p>Just as I put pen to paper, the copilot raps on the door. "Prime Minister? There's some news you need to hear."</p>

<p>President Pushkin hung his head in his hands as Commander in Chief Qin personally led the Chinese land forces into Red Square.  The entire month of February had been an endless series of frustrations, as nothing could stop the 100 million man army inevitably marching through Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, and Kazan.  Birth rates had plummeted for the better part of the century throughout Russia, and no amount of technology, armaments, or diplomacy could stop such a throng of people.  </p>
<p>His country had been through a lot over the centuries, but there was a bitter sting of shame in knowing that Qin was about to achieve what so many had failed on his watch. Pushkin looked out onto the square, and dejectedly slugged what was left of his vodka.</p>
<hr />
<p>"And that's another 6, I take Moscow!" beamed Odin, moving his piece, President Qin into the Russian capital.</p>
<p>Ra quipped, "Certainly took you long enough, you gave up a huge lead trying before, and now you've left Guangzhou vulnerable."</p>
<p>"Well that doesn't matter anymore," Odin grinned, as he flipped over his mission card:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conquer Russia in the Winter with a Land Army</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Noooo!" exclaimed Poseidon as he flipped over his card "I was one turn away from finishing cold fusion and winning!"</p>
<p>"Oh man, should have seen that coming, must have hurt to fail so spectacularly at it twice before," groaned Ra.</p>

<h4>[WP]Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?</h4>
<p>Score: 799</p>
<p>The Hitler Games have been a huge hit when it became public in the 24th century. Sure, in the past people did it just for fun. Then came the betting of "Hey, betcha I can kill Hitler better than you." People put hundreds, then thousands of dollars to try and one-up each other on this simple task. The end result was the same all around: Hitler dead, Allies win World War 2.</p>
<p>Some people didn't have the right imagination for this, so they started to have stand-ins for themselves. People who have entire lives dedicated to killing one man over and over. Started calling themselves the Anti-Gestapo out of sheer irony. It was only a matter of time until the Global Television Network played a couple of the more popular videos on their news networks and from there it became cemented in our culture.</p>
<p>Eventually people started to get in each other's way when setting up traps, or bringing down objects at the same time as each other. That's when the first Time Travel War actually happened, during World War 2 of all places. And over Hitler. It's amazing how stupid and greedy people can get. Laws were passed and then the first Hitler Games came to be.</p>
<p>People had to try out for their nation to enter. Then whoever won the Hitler Games won a substantial amount of money, fame for their country, and the most important part, however they killed him became the true history.</p>
<p>You see, time loves to stay in a straight line. Always heading in one direction. You can pick your starting point on the line, but your always going forwards. If there is a contradiction between what everyone knows as the past and you changing that, time just ignores that little inconsistency and it becomes a small footnote in time. The Grandfather Paradox was proven wrong by the first time traveler, no doubt. An eccentric man by the name of Viktor Odell wrote theories proving this paradox wrong but was always ignored by his fellow colleagues. So he invented it, went back and killed his grandfather. Came back with a signed photo from his grandmother with him standing next to the body. He was quickly put away, but was released due to the statute of limitations has passed. Viktor patented the time machine and soon everyone was killing and raping in the past. Then came the <em>second</em> Time Travel War. Yes, it happens in that order.</p>
<p>So for the past couple of years Germany has won the Hitler Games. Cheating bastards always had the upper hand. But last year, someone from a different nation won: me from Canada. How'd I win? Well, everyone loves the big explosion, the last gasp. I went a different route.</p>
<p>At first I made Hitler strong, made him win a few battles. Give him confidence in his nation's strength and in himself. Think he literally can take on the whole world. Then, I took everything away. Big losses in the war, one after another. But I still kept him alive. If there were other nation's assassins out to get him, I stopped those guys and made him feel the despair of being on top and falling straight to the bottom. Soon, Hitler was left with only one option: Killing himself.</p>
<p>It's very easy to kill one man. It's very hard to convince one man to kill himself.</p>

<p>It was a disappointment when we discovered that our attempts to change history affected nothing in the present, and instead, split the past off into two different timelines from the point of modification – and not only that, but after the new timeline had been disjointed from the Alpha line for too long, it would disintegrate and cease to exist, making any efforts to live in a better future fruitless. </p>
<p>After we learned all we could from our ancestors, and experimented with all manner of hypothetical scenarios that we devised in our laboratories we came to the realisation that we nothing left to do.</p>
<p>And so we put forth the very first 'Murdering Hitler' games. Born half from a crackpot idea and half from the primeval thoughts of revenge towards Adolf Hitler himself, we equipped a group of bloodthirsty youths with the means to both kill and record their killing of Hitler, and set them loose in Germany. Of course, most of them died, but the few that succeeded made it all worthwhile. The very first man to kill Hitler, an ex-convict by the name of Joseph Steinberg, opted not to use the weapons we had given to him, but instead beat Hitler to death with his fists. And through the pained screams and yells of <em>nein</em>, we realized that we had made entertainment far better than anything we had ever seen before.</p>
<p>The next iteration of the games was more refined, and those who entered in it the second year instead went in teams of two, to help combat the overwhelming militaristic force that was the Secret Service. And as the years went by we introduced theme after theme to spice up the games, and what  initially started as a tiny little project born from our depravities quickly became a national pastime of the depraved masses. We implemented rules and awards, and each and every year, billions would tune in to see Hitler bite the dust, again and again and again.</p>
<p>On the 22nd year, the theme was 'blindfolds'. And as it was to be expected, it was a slaughter. Even dressed in the best military gear we had to offer, all participants could do nothing about the fact that they could not even see. But one single man stood out from it all, yet another ex-convict, but one who thought with his brains rather than his fists. He simply removed his blindfold and shot Hitler in the middle of his speech.</p>
<p>We'll probably actually blind them next year.</p>

<p>Score: 284</p>
<p>Ever since the Council of Watchmen (no, they don't see why every new Chrono laughs at the name) first discovered and stabilized the bubble-universes, there's been a contest: who can kill Hitler the best?</p>
<p>Sure, it seems like a pointless game; after all, the first to kill Hitler would be the only one who got to, right? After all, any observed events are locked automatically, to prevent a breach of Rule 1.</p>
<p>Turns out, though, the bubble universes I talked about are weird. They are small splits in the main Yggdrasil corridor, little bubble universes accounting for slightly different properties of the period between 1941 and 1944. In some, Anne Frank was never found, in others, Hitler successfully captured Moscow.</p>
<p>And it's in these pockets that we compete.</p>
<p>We're scored on everything from difficulty of our particular bubble, to creativity in the actual murder bit, to whether or not we were observed (and believe it or not, unobserved isn't necessarily better). Some of the highlights of the early champions were the man who disguised himself as the corpse of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the lady who talked Eva Braun into killing her boyfriend, and the man who put acid in Hitler's shoes.</p>
<p>When I finally got greenlighted to compete, I was thrilled. I'd been planning this for a long time, and I knew I'd score in the top 7. I'd been given the paranoid-and-in-a-bunker scenario, which was rated an 11 out of the possible 13 in terms of difficulty, and nobody expected me to succeed.</p>
<p>How did I do it? The records don't do it justice. I took off all the landing precautions, landed in a branch of my bubble, around a fragmented Hitler. Then I led him into my actual scenario, and let him kill the other Hitler.</p>
<p>Then I killed him too, for good measure.</p>
<p>Had to burn the bodies, though. Would have been too many questions otherwise.</p>

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 276</p>
<p>The hitchhiker's targets were fairly specific, or at least he liked certain kinds of people. People who had kids, the more the better. People who were bastions of their community. Those kind hearted souls that everyone tended to love and miss. He loved knowing they would never find them again. He loved the searches and the tears and the heartbreak knowing children would grow up without a father or a mother, that a community lost someone they truly adored. Then, sometimes, he had to settle. Today was one of those days.</p>
<p>The man is oldish. He mentions that his kids are well into their 30s. His wife died years ago, and he is kind of a loner. It'll be an easy disappointing kill. He can at least get some pleasure at seeing how far he'll take him. Sometimes, people take him all the way to the cabin. They make it too easy. </p>
<p>"Hey, stranger, can you open my glove box and hand me those needles? I need some insulin."</p>
<p>The hitchhiker does. This is all too easy. The man stares at the road and fumbles with the box.</p>
<p>"Can you hold the wheel? This will only take a second."</p>
<p>The hitchhiker does. The driver fills up his syringe and pulls up his shirt. The hitchhiker looks back at the road and feels something in his neck. He pulls back and looks at him. </p>
<p>"Sorry, that's a sedative. I always forget what it's called. I mix it with a horse tranquilizer. It knocks people out pretty quick." </p>
<p>The hitchhiker leans towards the driver, but slumps in his seat, asleep. </p>
<p>When he wakes up, he's tied to a chair.</p>
<p>"Well, a man after my own heart, quite literally. I've ran into one of your kind before. I feel bad about it. It's like destroying the Mona Lisa or something, but it has to be done. Based on your gear, I thought you'd be more careful. People are foolish, but you are sloppy. This was way too easy. Your methods too. What was the plan? Drug me with morphine? Sloppy, oh so sloppy."</p>
<p>"Just let me go, sir."</p>
<p>"Respect, that's a new one. You must actually be afraid. You should be. Do you know how I started doing this?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Do you know how I started? I've only been taking care of hitchhikers for about a decade."</p>
<p>"H-how?"</p>
<p>"Well, I had a wonderful son who went missing one day. It was uncharacteristic of him because he was a loving devoted father. He was on his way to Missoula. I looked into it. There were quite a few missing person reports who were last seen on their way to places in this region. Now, that's strange. People crash and go missing all the time, but I talked to the families. Most of these missing people had a propensity for picking up hitchhikers."</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything to your son."</p>
<p>"Please, we are better than lies. That's what the last one like you said too. He was right, by the way. So, I kept looking. When I started, I kidnapped these people. Not all of them. Some of them I let go, but anyone suspicious I had to know. I felt like I was doing the world a favor too by killing these people, these criminals. It's amazing how easy it to justify it. Really, they didn't deserve to live and neither do you."</p>
<p>"Just let me go. I won't tell anyone."</p>
<p>"Please, three syringes with enough drugs to knock out an elephant? You're not a normal user. No track marks, anywhere. Three knives on your body? You can't always wait, can you? I understand, there is a perverse satisfaction in it."</p>
<p>"Shit, man, we could work together. We could ravage the countryside."</p>
<p>"There it is, a confession of sorts. No, you're my last. There have only been six for me. How about for you?"</p>
<p>"I stopped counting after 50." He says with a smile. </p>
<p>The hitchhiker's death is nothing special. The driver slices his throat and lets him bleed out. He dumps his body by the side of the road. His victims will likely find some justice. He leaves his bag with him. Hopefully, the cops will ask the right questions, and his son will be found, and his family will finally know what happened to him. That's what he hopes anyway.     </p>

<h4>[WP] A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rouge planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".</h4>
<p>Score: 214</p>
<p>The words, etched onto my arm like a brand, were so raw in meaning that I thought I had understood them. 
Oh how wrong I was...</p>
<p>We had seen it coming for decades - a collision with a transient planet crossing our solar plane - and prepared adequately; <em>most</em> of the populace had moved to the predicted opposite side of the planet, into state-of-the-art bunkers equipped to last 30, maybe 40 years at most. Some of us were left behind - the ones who had accepted their fates, the ones who denied theirs also - and we had collated in locations around the globe to watch it all unfold.</p>
<p>I was at Stonehenge, waiting for the start up of the 24-hour countdown clock with those of us who had remained in England. Why Stonehenge you ask? I haven't a clue - I never researched what it truly was - but it was voted for, and as such it became our location.
<em>click</em>
I heard the switch fly for the clock to start, but as the first few pixels lit up, everything stopped; people's bodies petrified, true emotion captured in facial expressions across the board, but not one meager atom moved anymore. I could still move though, as if unaffected by what had happened...</p>
<p>Scarcely 10 minutes later (or so it felt, considering the apparent universal standstill in effect) I felt my left arm go numb - as though I had been paralysed - as letters were carved into it by a mysterious source; <em>"However long it takes, save us"</em> they read, as if I had been chosen to be some kind of saviour. Me, a small suburban code monkey working on simple AI, a saviour? Ludicrous.</p>
<p>The next revelation of mine, I would guess it was around 20 minutes after that, was that I could not leave the boundaries of Stonehenge; I had to save whoever "us" referred to from within this tiny area. I won't lie; it was a useful thing to learn considering the vastness of the universe and however many sentient beings there may be that need saving, and so knowing that whoever needed ME specifically knew they could be saved by something here helped narrow down the requirements a little.</p>
<p>Of course, half an hour of light poking around doesn't expose much information, so I went deeper - so to speak - and began to look at each individual person, filtering through their belongings to glean what I could from any identification or item they had on them. Nothing stood out until the eighth person; I lifted a scrap of linen from her pocket with a red-stained symbol on it, reminiscent of one I'd seen earlier tattooed onto the third person (who was carrying a serrated-blade flick knife in their back pocket - perhaps the source of the writing on my arm), and that I had seen on the central stone.</p>
<p>Things fell into place rapidly - these people, with their runes and their knife, must have slipped me out of "their" time into a fixed point where I could search for a way to save them that they may not have thought of. I, of course, had no idea what the rest of it meant however - in my mind, and so I followed my gut; taking the knife I had found earlier, I put a drop of blood onto each of the runes on the central stone in order to save these people. Nothing happened, not instantly, not for the ten (maybe 20?) years I waited for it to happen: Time was still frozen.</p>
<p>I tried everything, but I couldn't even free myself from this time-lock by killing the people who I assumed put me there - the knife wouldn't touch them - and I couldn't leave Stonehenge. The words, etched onto my arm like a brand, were so raw in meaning that I thought I had understood them, I should have been free by now.</p>
<p>Then, in my madness, it clicked like the switch to start the clock. They always intended to die in the planetary collision, but they had left me behind at this point in time to save them, or rather, their memories. An unfaltering image of them in their life, "alive" in a sense of not being dead, with an undying observer to see that they are in fact alive.</p>
<p>"However long it takes" was a white lie. They had never meant for me to work out that there's nothing that can be done. I'm stuck here for eternity, keeping their image alive in my thoughts, "saving them" from death.</p>
<p>Edit: Was missing a letter.</p>

<p>Score: 212</p>
<p>I didn't intend to kill Hitler. I'm not the average time-traveler, you see, I just wanted to have a quiet life in the country side of the Old Europe. I found my lifestyle. I found a beautiful girl named Annabelle and worked my way up in French society at the time. I married Annabelle. I found and bought a quaint little house in a village. The village was built along a road, and at the end of the road lay a villa with pad-locked gates and streaming white walls. I had two children. The first was a boy named Dante, and the second was a girl named after my mother: Beatrice. Unfortunately, I hadn't read my history and forgot about World War II.</p>
<p>Germany invaded France and so came upon my little village which lay in Burgundy. First, came the overwhelming buzzing as the Luftwaffe began to toss their bombs. I didn't understand why they were attacking us at the time; I later found out that the villa was the site of large oil tanks and reserves, and just a few kilometers off was a hidden military base. The bombs swept over the village like a fiery storm, spitting fire, twisting and burning everything and everyone. My Time Machine was destroyed in my house during that first wave. My daughter burned to death; she was in her crib and was crying out as her flesh melted off her bones. I found her later, charred black with a gaping mouth but no tongue. Her teeth were still white as snow. The few bombs had created towering infernos that dashed and killed as an avenging angel of death. The Germans wasted an immense amount of resources on our useless village. When I returned to my time, I learned of their assaults on Paris and London, but I would never hear of their experiments of these techniques on small towns like mine.</p>
<p>My wife was changed after the storm. She would chatter in gibberish for a short while and then scream, pointing towards the darkness as if she saw a devil materialise in front of her. She would rock back and forth on the ground. I had to move her everywhere in a wheelbarrow I found. We met up with the other survivors. Night fell, I fell asleep, I woke up and my wife was gone. Not even a note was left. She had dashed off into the forest like a wild animal.</p>
<p>My son was twelve years old, and was all that remained of my past life. He supported me, his father, and saved me from despair. I cried on him every night, and he would muffle my tears so that the others in our make-shift refugee camp didn't hear me and disapprove of my weakness. Soon, French trucks came and brought us to Paris. My son and I took up residence at my wife's parent's house, they were grieved over their daughter, but gladly brought us into their home and reassured us of victory against Germany.</p>
<p>The next day, all of France bowed to Germany in defeat.</p>
<p>The soldiers marched in with crisp uniforms and rigid steps. They goose-stepped their way to their glory and France's shame. In trucks stood their leaders, and from my weak knowledge of 20th Century History, I recognised Adolf Hitler. </p>
<p>The machinations of my terror and the evils that had befallen in me lay in this man. My doom had been set at the moment I lay my eyes on the man. My blood heated up, and my heart beat twice as fast when I saw him. My brain pounded in my head and I felt sick in my stomach. I looked at him through my in-laws' windows, and only one thought dashed through my mind over and over.</p>
<p><em>Revenge.</em></p>
<p>My time machine had been destroyed. All I had left were the tools I brought from the future. A knife and an invisibility cloak. But the cloak would break if I attempted any action outside of it; it could only be used for reconnaissance. </p>
<p>So I set out for my revenge. I went to my in-laws and spoke with them for a few minutes, I told them to take care of my son, and that I intended to return, but that I would be gone for a while. They nodded but they seemed afraid. My tone of voice and pale pallor scared them. I left without saying anything to my son, I didn't want him to stop me with his words. I walked off to stalk Hitler.</p>

<p>"What do you mean you didn't kill him, that's the whole point of the game!" John shouted at me, I hated it when John shouted, his voice was so grating.</p>
<p>"Just what I said," I spoke between sips of my soda, "I didn't kill him. I just fucked with him."</p>
<p>"How do you win the game off that alone?!" He questioned, his head tilted to the side like a dog hearing the sound of a tube TV turning on for the first time.</p>
<p>"Well, You know how he was an artist right?" I questioned, "Of course you do, everyone knows that -- I've personally got a couple of paintings up in my bathroom. Everyone seems to love his work, so you want to know what I did? I went back to 1889 -- took a job at... oh gosh, what's that school? Vienna's Academy? Yeah I think that's it... I worked under the name of Mr. Goldberg and just bide my time. I saw a couple of great artists at the time pass through, though I can't remember there names worth a damn.
Anyway, around 1914 or so, I saw this spry little prick waltz into my class. He was so full of hope and life and energy. And I just told him to fuck off. Told he he'll never ammount to anything. And that's how I won, by turning the world's greatest artist into the world worst murderer."</p>
<p>"Dude, you're literally worse than Hitler."</p>

<p>Bit by bit, part by part.
I will pick this planet apart.
Piece by piece, section by section,
An eternity with no connection.
Time is frozen, time is gone.
I really got my digging on.
To end it all
I need this ball
To disappear
for my salvation.</p>

<p>It took me a while. Ha, maybe I'm understating it. Four million twenty six thousand and 3 days. Eleven thousand and thirty years. Fuck. What would happen when I finished? I looked up at the behemoth structure I had built, admiring my audacity. Like a giant fly swatter, it stood. Facing the sun that never fell, carrying with it the hopes and dreams of a time ravaged mind.</p>
<p>The first few years had been fun. Time had frozen a day before the meteor was predicted to strike. People took the news better than I had expected, only a few looters, most people went along with their lives as if nothing was happening. Sometimes it can be hard to upset the status quo. With a message of hope riding on my arms, I flew free. Running around town, enjoying the finer things in life. I ate at every fine restaurant in New York for three months. All the food had been frozen at the right temperature, so succulent, so perfect. I used to like food.</p>
<p>The first millenia I- I don't recall. A thousand years of life, and I don't even remember. Most of it was probably spent in panic. I think it took me decades to find the spectroscopic analysis of the ball. Talcum powder. The same shit used in rouge. Fucking dry wall was going to end the world. I doubt the TV coverage mentioned that information....</p>
<p>The second and third millenia were perhaps my most productive. I built probably a dozen massive projects, all aimed at blowing the damn thing apart. None of them ever launched. Time just kept.... timing.</p>
<p>Eventually I went mad. London doesn't exist anymore. I called myself god and smote the wicked. London bridge fell. </p>
<p>Eventually I turned to Bhuddism. I meditated everywhere, even under a bodhi tree. For a while I found enlightenment. Unfortunately the enlightened mind wasn't made to last forever. </p>
<p>Five thousand years ago I rediscovered my task. I built the world a giant net. My goal was to blast through the talcum, dispersing it into a fine cloud. I had built a fleet of ships, all designed to collect the talc, clean our environment of the inevitable fallout. This would work I told myself. This was the end.</p>

<p>The good news is I couldn't die, I wasn't aging, I didn't need to sleep, eat, or drink, and my body didn't produce waste.<br />
The bad news is it had been a solid ten years - I think? - and I was no closer to finding a fast way to stop the damn planet.<br />
It had started back in 2023, when NASA announced that they had detected a rogue planet about the size of Mercury flying toward the solar system. Then in 2024 they announced that it would fly  really close to Earth, about ten lunar distances away. Which was going to be super cool. If you were into astronomy, you'd get some awesome views. If you weren't, one, what's wrong with you, and two, there'd be some awesome waves for surfing. Then things went horribly wrong.<br />
There's an old story about Halley's Comet. When Halley figured out the comet's orbit in 1705, he predicted it would come back in 1758. But he was off by a few months because he didn't correctly account for gravitational interaction with Jupiter.<br />
There's also a saying that those who don't study history are doomed to repeat it.<br />
Whoops.<br />
Early 2025 rolled around. The planet flew by Jupiter, got nudged in orbit a little bit, and Earth collectively started to panic. All the space agencies now were in agreement on its path, and there were no more major objects that could disrupt its orbit. It was on a dead-on collision course with Earth.<br />
Eventually the planet got close enough that we could see it at night, and then in the day. Humans being human, there were actually countdowns on the internet counting down to the second of impact. The countdown was down to about twelve hours when suddenly it froze. As did everyone in the room with me. I looked outside. Yup, everyone was frozen out there too. I looked up. The planet wasn't moving, which was nice. But why could I still move? That's when I felt the pain on my arm. I looked down and saw that letters were being written on me. "S..A..V..E....U..S..."<br />
Well, balls.<br />
So now I have to find a way to stop a planet from crashing into Earth. The good news is I have plenty of time. Course, I have no idea how to do it.<br />
I honestly don't know how this time freezing thing is working, because it seems like only half of time has stopped. I mean, I can still see things, and if I speak I can hear myself. If I throw something, it flies like normal, but if I bump into a person they stay frozen, even in physically impossible positions. Chemical reactions still work but the internet doesn't. Electricity in general works though, and things don't seem to lose power. It's all weird and basically I'm stuck using books to get an idea of how to stop this thing.<br />
So far my best idea is to build a rocket to get up to the planet. I found one that NASA had apparently been planning to use for something, until their efforts got refocused on brainstorming ways to stop the Earth from getting destroyed. Once I get up there though, that's when the real fun begins. The planet is about the size of Mercury, so I'm guessing the escape velocity is about the same. If that's true, I could get individual rocks away from it just by throwing them really hard. Since gravity evidently isn't working on a large scale - one, the planet isn't moving toward Earth, two, Earth isn't moving toward the sun, and three, none of the other planets seem to have moved - if I throw a rock from the planet toward the sun, it'll get there without having to deal with escaping Earth's gravity well.<br />
Resigning myself to many lifetimes of labor, I've loaded the rocket with a few thousand pickaxes. I'm leaving in about six hours. And hey, in a few thousand years I'll be able to say that I'm the only person to have completely dismantled a planet.</p>
