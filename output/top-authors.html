<p>I have been experimenting with reddit API, and have decided to compile a list of the best(most upvoted) <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/">/r/WritingPrompts</a></strong> authors and their top stories.</p>
<hr />
<p>Due to the limitations of the API the data can not be 100% exact, but it's pretty close.</p>
<p>List includes only the authors who have written at least 5 stories, with at least 3 stories having 100+ upvotes(to exclude people who wrote only one highly upvoted story).</p>
<p>"Karma" is calculated based on the number of upvotes to top-level comments(to count only stories, and ignore upvotes coming from prompt submissions and other comments). </p>
<!-- You can find the script used to generate this list **[here](https://github.com/raymestalez/reddit-scripts)**. -->
