	  <h1>[WP] After dying, you're shown a "Choose Your Own Adventure" style decision tree which highlights all the paths your life could have taken should you have made various different choices. You spend all of eternity analyzing this tree, only to finally realize that something just isn't quite right.</h1>
<p>Score: 2618</p>
<p>EDIT: THERE IS NOW AN OFFICIAL SUBREDDIT TO DISCUSS THIS POST AND ITS EXPANSION INTO A FULLY FLEDGED NOVEL. /r/MattsWrittenWord IF YOU WISH TO BE KEPT UP TO DATE WITH THIS STORIES PRODUCTION PLEASE ENTER IT. </p>
<p>"Okay, that never happened in the first place, " I stated simply to the reaper invigilator. "Something is wrong in your base files because after a millenium of analysis and searching my memories I can tell you... that one never happened."</p>
<p>The reaper floated closer to me, it's black trench coat flapping slightly in the non existent breeze of my eternity-vault. I felt sorry for the reapers at times like this, I'd always been stubborn and it probably didn't deserve it. They were born at the same time as our souls were and tethered to us for the rest of eternity. They didn't want it, they didn't need it and the contract was ultimately binding. It was a good thing that my reaper and I got on, otherwise eternity would have been all kinds of messed up. </p>
<p>"It's probably part of an offshoot then, wouldn't be the first time time you've made that mistake," the reaper snarked, drifting over to my record banks. </p>
<p>"Not an offshoot, up top got really pissy last time I made that mistake, never again," I muttered shaking my head. "Look, right there, that kiss. I have full access to all my memories in here and I can tell you that one did not happen." </p>
<p>I would have liked it to though, that much both me and the reaper knew.  I'd studied the offshoot that one had spawned many times before. Love, fortune, joy and a distinctive lack of the money owed that lead to me... dying. It would have been a nice and long life, one of the happiest offshoots there had been. But it wasn't real, that much I knew.  </p>
<p>"You're right..." The reaper clarified, "that's new... that wasn't there the last time we scanned that segment... so how is it there now..."</p>
<p>We both floated in silence for a moment, staring at the erroneous piece of time line.  Nothing like this had happened to us before and the reaper had never heard of it happening to any of the other deads either. It was a perplexing quandary to say the least.</p>
<p>"I'm contacting head office now, keep an eye on your time line,  anything else changes you let me know straight away okay?" The reaper ordered before drawing the outline of a phone, the item materialising near instantly. Damn reapers and their matter manipulation talents, I wish I had matter manipulation abilities, all sorts of fun things could happen then.</p>
<p>I turned my eyes back to the time line,  tracing along from the new change. A heavy lump formed in my throat. The whole thing was twisting and cracking and splintering out of control. Offshoots replacing reality then melding the two together in a strange abomination of the two. </p>
<p>"Reap, my time line is going out of control, get someone in here right now," I ordered. He didnt reply but from the crack of energy behind me I knew the head honcho had showed up.</p>
<p>He wasn't God, he hadn't created humanity, rather the opposite. He was one of the first reapers and had been the one to sort out the department of reaping along with his Human. If it weren't for them our time lines would have been lost to the winds of time, and then what would we have spent eternity doing? </p>
<p>"This better not be another mistake Daniels," the head said, amusement tinting his tone. "By the gods..." he muttered as he drew closer and saw what was happening. </p>
<p>"Is it localised to him?" My Reaper asked and the head nodded in response. </p>
<p>"Someone from the living world is tampering with his time line,  they're trying to find an eventuality where he becomes immortal," the head explained,  his eyes flicking over the twisting lines. </p>
<p>"We never discovered anything like that during our analysis, and we've been here for over a millenia," I said, my voice incredulous. There was no way there was such a time line, and even if there was who would want me to live forever that badly?</p>
<p>"My Human and I have been in this realm for many more thousands of years Daniels, I can assure you that you haven't seen every possibility yet."</p>
<h2>The world began to flicker in and out of my vision. I vaguely heard the head swear and my own reaper gasp in pain. They must have found it.  The one where I lived forever. For the first time since death I felt a little flutter of excitement. I was going back to the world of the living... I wonder if I will remember any of this.</h2>
<h1>[WP] You just got fired, you're pretty sure your girlfriend is cheating on you, you're 75k in student loans debt, rent was due last week, and to top it all off? You're all out of beer. Oddly enough, you just got an email titled "Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard."</h1>
<p>Score: 2477</p>
<p>I broke my fixation on the woefully empty bottle of beer to glance down at my phone as it <em>dinged</em>, notifying me about an email. I sighed. Debt collectors and spam. That's all I ever got anymore. At least the latter allowed me the pleasure of pressing the fun little trashcan icon. </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change...</strong>, the preview of the subject read. Hell, yeah. I would give anything to change everything right now. My girlfriend was gone on some escapade with her not-so-secret lover, my student loan debt was three times what I made in a year, pre-taxes, the eviction notice was still taped to the door... I hadn't been too broke to buy beer since college, but here I was. Same old.</p>
<p>I swiped right and typed in the double 69 password; a relic from more cheerful times. The email was short and to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very hard.</strong> Seemed about as legit as the Nigerian prince my grandpa was always helping out. My finger hovered over the trashcan icon but my phone <em>dinged</em> again, the echo bouncing off the walls of the nearly empty room. A text this time with the same message and a simple instruction: <strong>Reply YES for details</strong>. I shrugged and typed the message, arching my eyebrows skeptically as the message <em>whooshed</em> away and I turned back to the bottle hoping to leach out a couple more drops.</p>
<p><strong>Pick your level: First World Problems, Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard</strong>. I sighed. Whoever this was, they were persistent. A cruel joke, most likely. Getting my hopes up that my life could be anything more than a miserable shit hole. I chose the first option and hit send, shrugging in mild irritation before sighing and heading to my bed. Without the electric bills paid and nothing to entertain me, I was sleeping by dusk, my schedule more Amish than an Ohioan's. My phone rang a moment later, just as I was settling in and starting to tell myself a bedtime story.</p>
<p>"Mom?" I said hesitantly, surprised that she would call after six months of not talking to me. She let out a muffled sob and I sat up in my bed. "What happened?"</p>
<p>"It's dad..." she stuttered as she struggled to catch her breath. I frowned. My dad had been getting cigarettes since '95 and if he was suddenly showing up now, I wanted nothing to do with him. "Your grandfather passed away," she said quietly and I scowled. Disrupting my 8 o'clock bedtime for this? The man was a grade A dumbass and had provided more for random hookers than he had for me.</p>
<p>"I... I'm sorry," I managed to say half-heartedly.</p>
<p>"You barely knew him," she answered softly. "I can't see what he saw, but he must have thought very highly of you. He left you his fortune and the house by the lake. You're rich..." she said mournfully and I quietly gulped as I tried to fathom the idea.</p>
<p>"Goddammit," I sighed knocking my head against the headboard of the bed. "I'm gonna have a shit ton of taxes to do."</p>

<p>Jack looked back in his rearview to see Mike yawn audibly from the backseat, tapping absently on a bottle of root beer as they crawled on the interstate.</p>
<p>"Can't you go any slower?" Mike said. Jack couldn't help but concede that Mike had the right to complain- he'd confiscated all the booze and insisted on driving, after all. </p>
<p>Jack ignored him and drove on in silence. He was way under the speed limit, but the last thing he wanted was for a creature or person to dash in front of their headlights, starting a night of misadventure to hide the dead body.</p>
<p>Jennifer, sitting on the passenger side, frowned. Her peroxide blonde hair wafted in the wind.</p>
<p>"Oh, no! There's no network." </p>
<p>Mike scoffed. "Who cares, Jenn? We're on a camping trip. The point is to get away from civilization for a little while."</p>
<p>"No worries, I bought a satellite phone with extra batteries for this trip," Jack brought out a Nokia from his pocket.</p>
<p>Mike rolled his eyes. Then his eyes widened.</p>
<p>"Would you look at that?"</p>
<p>"Woah!" Jenn exclaimed as she looked at a small dirt road that forked off the asphalt. It was blocked by a rusty old gate that carried an ominous warning for trespassers.</p>
<p>"That padlock," Mike said, "is older than my grandpa. I bet we can break in. The view looks gorgeous too- what the fuck?"</p>
<p>Jack swiveled the car and floored it till the gate was out of sight. Then he slowed back down to under the speed limit.</p>
<p>"Ain't no way we're going in there. Go alone if you want to."</p>
<p>"You're such a killjoy, Jack," Jennifer said.</p>
<p>Killjoy- Jack smiled at her choice of words. <em>I can be as joyless as needed</em>, he thought, <em>as long as I'm not killed</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The tents were up and the campfire rustled. It was a small clearing in a state park that the Parks and Wildlife Department had certified safe for campers. Jack had scoured the internet to double check. He didn't find any creepy legends or strange sightings in any of the forums.</p>
<p>Jack lay down in his tent and checked the batteries on his flashlight.</p>
<p>"Hey, Jack. " Jennifer snuck inside the tent coyly. She gave a flirtatious half-smile as she lay down next to him. </p>
<p>"Oh hell no!"</p>
<p>Jennifer sprang back, she wasn't used to this reaction.</p>
<p>Jack had seen too many movies. Sex was practically the harbinger for a gruesome death. There was no way he was having sex in a forest on a dark, moonless night with a pack of coyotes wailing in the distance.</p>
<p>He looked at her glassy eyes still recovering from the rejection. Feeling bad for her, he lied.</p>
<p>"It's not you, Jenn. It's me. I'm gay."</p>
<p>""What? But what about Stacie-"</p>
<p>"I just realized this morning. Don't tell Mike, or anyone else for that matter. Please?"</p>
<p>She took her clothes and left.</p>
<hr />
<p>Despite all precautions and traps set by Jack around their tents, something had attacked their camp and they were on the run. They panted as they stopped upon a bifurcation in the hiker's trail.</p>
<p>"We should split up," Mike said.</p>
<p>Jennifer nodded in agreement. Jack looked at them in amazement.</p>
<p>"Are you fucking kidding me?"</p>
<p>"What? It will be easier. We split up, find some help, then come back in this exact same spot and we're all safe."</p>
<p>"El fucking oh el."</p>
<p>"Jack, look. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I need you to show some teamwork here."</p>
<p>"Over my dead body. I'm gonna follow you guys and I'll be in the middle. Mike, you lead. Jenn, you follow."</p>
<p>Mike and Jenn sighed, but finally agreed with Jack as they heard their pursuers closing in.</p>
<hr />
<p>Twigs snapped and branches slapped on their faces as the three of them ran. It had been a good decision to let Mike take the lead. The monster- or whatever it was attacking them, had come from the front.</p>
<p>Mike, who'd already been stumbling, finally fell down.</p>
<p>"Shit!" He screamed in pain.</p>
<p>Jack and Jennifer looked back at Mike, hunched on the ground, clutching his ankle in agony.</p>
<p>"You two go ahead- I'll be fine," he said, waving his hands, taking his voice an octave higher, trying hard to sound heroic.</p>
<p>"Good idea," Jack said as he turned to run.</p>
<p>"Hey! I was kidding, obviously. Help out, dude. You've gotta carry me."</p>
<p>"Did that thing bite you?"</p>
<p>"Did it what?"</p>
<p>"Did it bite you?"</p>
<p>Mike didn't reply. His hand subconsciously grazed over his shoulders, where, Jack noticed, there was a deep gash.</p>
<p>"Fuck you, I'm outta here."</p>
<p>Jennifer looked at Jack running through the thickets. Then back at Mike, who was now lying on the ground like easy prey. She said a quick sorry and ran in Jack's direction.</p>
<hr />
<p>The monsters had cornered them. </p>
<p>Jack cowered behind a fallen log. Jenn started making nervous noises. She was having a panic attack.</p>
<p>He thought of putting a hand to her mouth and trying to soothe her out of it. But he could hear the footsteps of the creatures coming closer and closer.</p>
<p>Nice guys finish last, Jack. He reminded himself. With a quick hit under the nose he knocked her unconscious.</p>
<hr />
<p>They seemed to be safe for the moment. They had lost the monsters. Jack's shoulders were aching from carrying an unconscious Jenn. </p>
<p>"Where are we?" She asked, there was a drowsiness in her voice suggesting that she was still not out of it.</p>
<p>They entered an area of low growth and in front of them was a small cabin.</p>
<p>"Oh look, a cabin in the woods. We're saved!"</p>
<p>Jack could see a confederate flag hanging from one of the windows. On the yard two holes had been dug out. Six feet under, human-sized.</p>
<p>"Hey! We need help!" Jenn called out.</p>
<p>Jack put her down. He could hear highway sounds not far away.</p>
<p>"You seem to have regained consciousness. Good luck with the creepy cabin dude, I'm out of it."</p>
<p>And with that Jack ran in the direction of the highway, noping the fuck out of a sleepover at the creepy cabin.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jack was glad to have reached civilization as he waved at the passing cars.</p>
<p>A station wagon with "Free Candy" scribbled with key scratches on the rusted hull stopped by him.</p>
<p>"Need a ride?"</p>
<p>"No thanks." Jack said, and started moving along the road.</p>
<p>The man looked disappointed but drove away.</p>
<p>After waiting a bit, Jack saw a squad car approach.</p>
<p>He couldn't control his joy. He had escaped the ordeal. He had survived in a horror movie setting despite being black. This was a story he was going to tell his grandchildren. He jumped and waved frantically at his uniformed saviors.</p>
<p>The cops got out and screamed into the radio.</p>
<p>"We found the suspect! Suspicious black male, blood splatters on his t-shirt."</p>
<p>"Down on the ground!" The other cop shouted.</p>
<p>"No, no, you've got it wrong." Jack tried to calm them down, his palms up front, facing them.</p>
<p>"Suspect acting hostile, I repeat suspect acting hostile..."</p>
<p><em>Bang! Bang!</em> The other cop emptied his cartridges and Jack lay on the street, blood pooling on the asphalt in an ever-enlarging puddle.</p>

<h1>[CW] Write a gruesome story using only euphemisms so than it can be read to a group of children without frightening them</h1>
<p>Score: 2187</p>
<p>George worked all day long putting animals to sleep. Helping animals go to sleep was his job. He put all different kinds of dogs to sleep, and all kinds of cats, and once he even put a lizard to sleep. For some reason putting all these animals to sleep -- sometimes even fifty or sixty animals in one day! -- made George very tired and worn out, as if instead of putting animals to sleep he'd spent the day carrying bags of sand up a steep hill.</p>
<p>Sometimes, late at night, George dreamed about the animals. In his dreams the dogs and cats and lizard were awake, with happy looks on their dog and cat and lizard faces. The dogs had big pink tongues that drooped out. The cats purred and licked their fur. The lizard kind of just sat there. When they saw George, though, the animals acted very scared. The dogs put their tails between their legs and backed away with sad eyes. The cats hissed and climbed into trees. The lizard continued to kind of just sit there, although it looked a little bit alarmed.  </p>
<p>"Please," said George, "I don't want to hurt you."  </p>
<p>But the animals never let him anywhere near them.  </p>
<p>When George was working, he tried to think about other things. He thought about his friends. George was sixty-eight years old, and many of his friends had passed away, but he still remembered many excellent things about them. One of his friends, Michael, whose skin was the creamy color of milk chocolate, had a habit of flipping the bird at police officers. This was always good for a laugh, until one day a policeman took offense to the bird-flipping and introduced Michael to the business end of his nightstick. Michael was sent to a correctional facility. He kicked the bucket shortly thereafter.  </p>
<p>George estimated that he'd put something like ten thousand animals to sleep in his lifetime. This number, which increased every day, weighed very heavily on his shoulders. It got to a point where he couldn't go five minutes without thinking about buying the farm. If he bought the farm, he could see his parents again, and he'd never have to put any more animals to sleep. He began to read articles on the Internet about the easiest way to buy the farm. One article said the easiest way was to sit in your car in your garage, but George didn't have a garage, or even a car. Another article said you could use your Second Amendment rights to buy the farm, but George's various run-ins with the law as a youth prevented him from passing a background check.  </p>
<p>In the end, George opted for the method of buying the farm that seemed quickest and most simple: he climbed up to the top of a very tall skyscraper, said a prayer, and flew away.  </p>
<p>After that, the animals he'd put to sleep weren't afraid to let him touch them any more. The dogs jumped on him and licked his face. The cats pressed themselves against his legs.  </p>
<p>Even the lizard let him rub it on the back of its head.  </p>

<p>"You mean you really never realized? I'm wearing the Archmage's Robes <em>right now</em>!"</p>
<p>"Well, I just... I don't know, I thought the outfit was one of those cheap replicas you can buy at the tourist's shops in Imperial City."</p>
<p>"But they're <em>glowing</em> and <em>shimmering</em>. Clearly magical. And also they still have that old man smell from the last Archmage."</p>
<p>"I just... I guess I never noticed that."</p>
<p>"Ok... well, what about the Grey Cowl? I mean, it belonged to Nocturnal herself! There's no way that could be a fake."</p>
<p>"Well I didn't <em>know</em> what it was. I mean, I've seen people from Bruma before, so I figured you were just ugly and wanted a mask to hide your face or something."</p>
<p>"No, it's the real deal. And I'd also watch those snide little insults, given that I'm Guildmaster in the Fighting Guild."</p>
<p>"By Sheogorath's Tongue, man! What <em>aren't</em> you? Next you're going to tell me that you're, like, Martin the Savior's best friend or something!"</p>
<p>"Errr... well, yeah, kind of. We were pretty tight. See, me and his dad - You know, Emperor Urial Septim? - we escaped through the Imperial City's sewers this one time, and..."</p>
<p>"I was being sarcastic! You seriously knew both of them? By the Nine, how <em>old</em> are you? I mean, doesn't someone have to work for like an entire lifetime of study and practice to become Archmage?"</p>
<p>"No, no. It took me.... I dunno, like a day or so? You know, now that I think about it, it took just about as long as it took me to become the Listener here in the Dark Fraternity."</p>
<p>"Dark <em>Brotherhood</em>."</p>
<p>"Right, right. Sorry."</p>
<p>"I seriously can't believe this. My own father spent his entire life mastering <em>just illusion magic</em>, and you're telling me that you became Archmage in a <em>day</em>? <em>HOW</em>?"</p>
<p>"It was pretty easy, actually. The last Archmage vanished into a soul gem or something. I don't remember; I wasn't paying attention. Let's see... I ran a bunch of errands, and then they had me kill some King of Worms guy... you know, the funny part was that I never even used magic on him! It just took a few hits from the good old battleaxe, and boom! They promoted me."</p>
<p>"You've got to be kidding me. I kill people all the time! That's all you had to do?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I can barely even do a lightning spell. Kind of messed up, huh? I bet there are a ton of mages back there who really wanted that job. Really sucks for them."</p>
<p>"Wow. This is just... wow. So you are <em>simultaneously</em> the Listener, the Archmage, the Guildmaster, and the Hero of Kvatch!? That's just... damn."</p>
<p>"Yeah. It's been a pretty busy month."</p>
<p>"I just... man, we've got to line up with a fight between you and the Grand Champion of the Arena! He's killed, like, <em>everyone</em> that they send at him. He's probably the only person in Cyrodiil that'll give you a run for your money."</p>

<p>I sat on a park bench, eating my lunch.  I watched as a little girl rolled by on a shiny metal scooter, watching me out of the corner of her eyes.  She zipped around and passed me again.<br />
"Hello," I said.<br />
She stopped, her eyes wide.<br />
"I like your scooter."<br />
She looked down at the scooter, her ponytail flopping in her face, then beamed at me. "It's my trusty steed, Sparklehorn!"  She pointed to a pink sticker of a unicorn.  "He's a unicorn."<br />
"Oh, I see." I smiled. "I've never met a unicorn before."<br />
The girl frowned and pointed at me. "You're the time trampler."<br />
"Time <em>traveller.</em>"<br />
She shrugged.  "My mommy says I can't talk to you. She says you are dangerous."<br />
"Ok." I ate a bite of my sandwich. "What does your daddy say?"<br />
The girl twirled her hair with a finger and scrunched up her face. "He says you're a <em>commie bastard</em>."<br />
"Oh."<br />
The girl furrowed her eyebrows. "What's a 'bastard'?"<br />
I chuckled. "Go ask your daddy."<br />
The girl laid her scooter down on the sidewalk.  "Wanna see me do a cartwheel?"<br />
"Sure."<br />
I finished my lunch as the girl cavorted around me on the sidewalk.  I opened a small bag of cookies while she practiced handstands.  Upside down, she heard the crinkle of the cookie bag and turned her head towards me.<br />
"Are those cookies?"  She dropped her feet and stood up. "I only like chocolate chip cookies."  She paused and tried to look nonchalant. "Do your cookies have any chocolate chips, maybe?"<br />
"They do indeed."  I showed her the bag. "Would you like one?"<br />
"Yes!" she squealed.<br />
I held out a cookie and she snatched it gleefully.<br />
"Do they have chocolate where you are from?" she asked, spraying crumbs onto the sidewalk.    <br />
"I'm from here, sweetie."<br />
"Noooo," she whined, "do they have chocolate <em>in the future</em>?"<br />
I shrugged. "I'm not from the future, I was born in this time.  And I only go backwards in time, not forwards." I paused. "I think."<br />
The girl thought about this for a moment.  "My daddy says you killed people. Is that true?"<br />
I nodded. "That's what all the history books say, so... I guess so?"<br />
"Why?"<br />
"I don't know. I haven't done it yet."<br />
A woman turned the corner on the sidewalk, pushing a stroller.  "Lydia," she called.<br />
"Uh oh," I said.<br />
The little girl's eyes widened and she shoved the rest of her cookie in her mouth and wiped chocolate off her face.  "Thank you," she said through a mouthful of cookie.  She scooped up her scooter and hurried back to her mother.<br />
Her mother scowled in recognition at me and pulled Lydia away down the sidewalk.  I sighed and began cleaning up my lunch.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
"It must be hard for you," said a voice, behind me.  <br />
I turned to see an old man with a cane approaching my bench.  He gestured with his cane to the space beside me.<br />
"May I sit?"<br />
I nodded and tossed my lunch trash into a garbage can next to the bench.<br />
"I'm sorry that everyone treats you poorly," the man said. "You walk a hard enough road already."<br />
"I guess."  I shrugged. "It's weird knowing all these things that I will do.  Like seeing my whole life ahead of me."<br />
"Not your whole life," said the man. "Just the parts that history remembers." The man fiddled with his cane. "History rarely tells the whole story, in my experience."<br />
"I wish I knew why I did, or will do, those things." I hold up my empty hands and examine my palms. "I'm going to stab some poor painter to death in Vienna in 1906? Why would I do that? I've never hurt anyone in my life."<br />
The old man nodded. "Sometimes, we have to make a choice between saving a few or saving many. Maybe it was for the greater good."<br />
"But what about Dallas in 1963? Everyone knows that I was there." I shook my head. "Why don't I save the President? Why didn't I stop Oswald? I did nothing! Why was I even there?"<br />
"Don't be too hard on yourself." The old man clapped a hand on my shoulder. "Especially for something you haven't done yet."<br />
"Some people think that I was the one who pulled the trigger," I mumbled. "I get so many emails about grassy knolls."<br />
"Maybe you were," said the old man. "Maybe you weren't. Maybe you were supposed to save the President but you simply failed." The old man smiled at me. "You're only human, you know, even if you do travel through time."<br />
"I wish that I could just get on with it," I said. "Ever since the discovery of those old photos, I've just drifted along, waiting for time travel." I wrung my hands. "It's been ten years already.  Ten years of people avoiding me—or worse, actively trying to hurt me. Women won't date me. Nobody will hire me.  I am pretty sure that the government has people following me."  I pointed to a man in a suit, standing near a tree.  The man waved.  "See?"<br />
"I know it's hard," said the old man. "And, unfortunately, it won't get any easier."<br />
"What do you mean?"<br />
"Your life. It won't get any easier."  The old man sighed. "It's hard to have a wife if you're hopping through time. Hard to have a family, to raise children."<br />
"Oh great, thanks for that."  I rolled my eyes. "Very inspirational." <br />
"It's the truth." The old man shrugged. "You are going to do some very important work. It will have to be enough for you."<br />
I looked at the old man.<br />
He gave me a small smile. "What if I told you that your sacrifice will save millions of lives?" He gestured towards the people in the park—the moms with their strollers, the children, the young men playing frisbee. "All of these people, their parents, grandparents.  Their children, too.  You will save them, although you will always travel alone, it is true. But with your help, humanity will avoid several major catastrophes."<br />
"Is that why I kill that painter?"<br />
"Yes."<br />
"What happens if I don't?"<br />
The man stared into the distance. He opened his mouth to speak but closed it and stood.<br />
"It is better if I show you," he said. "Come with me. It's time to begin your training."<br />
My mouth dropped. "Wait a second... this is it? Right now?"<br />
The old man nodded.<br />
I stood up.  We begin walking.<br />
"Wait," I said.  "How do you know all this stuff?"<br />
My eyes widened.  "Oh my god..." I lowered my voice.  "Are you... me? From the future?"<br />
"No," said the old man, shaking his head with a chuckle. 
"I'm your son."  </p>

<h1>[WP] Your roommate is 2nd most powerful superhero in the world and he will not shut up about it. He does not yet know that you are the 1st.</h1>
<p>Score: 1945</p>
<p>I never understood why every superhero out there wore capes. I swear, the amount of raw fabric he goes through must be inversely proportionally to his IQ. My roommate is the self proclaimed "Second Most Powerful Hero to ever live." Never mind he hasn't ever faced off against any truly powerful super villain. Those were taken care of years upon years ago. </p>
<p>Let's break it down. Ryan, my roommate, has; heat vision, frost breath, super strength, skin that can stop bullets and lasers, the ability to breathe in space, and a laundry list of other abilities. He's made me time him flying to the moon and back. Usually I don't have time to press the stop watch. He's all hot air. Well, unless you put these funny green or red rocks near him. Something to do with his home world and all that. </p>
<p>I digress. Today has been strange indeed. He's insisted, once again that I time him. Something about wanting to feel his ranking. I kind of tune him out when he starts going on these rants about his powers. I just kind of tick on my fingers the ones that he's listed. More than anything I just want to tell him to shut up most of the time. However, I really can't. You see, I have a certain ability. An ability that makes the world a much better place than anyone can dream of. Day in and day out I save the world over and over again from a threat that's possibly strong enough to destroy the universe. I keep the idiots in the world cloaked in their own little bubbles. No supervillian has risen in my lifetime, nor will any. </p>
<p>If you haven't guessed yet. I am the most powerful superhero in existence. Not because of the powers I have, but because of what I do. I keep the biggest, most powerful idiot in existence, well, entertained. Well, that, and I can make a lot of copies of myself. So, for every hero that's out there I'm there. I'm watching them all drone on about being number two. After all, no one is more dangerous than someone with something to prove. However, when you're proving it to someone that doesn't care then the world is a much better place. </p>

<p>"Your move, God." Dexicon roared, knowing it had the ancient deity in its proverbial palm.</p>
<p><em>Shit shit shit</em>  thought God. It was tough to display no emotion but a strong poker face was crucial. Dexicon had already taken Zeermon out the game and had now moved on to God.</p>
<p>God had not been blessed with much luck.  Each deity had been given a species that had space travel potential. The objective was to either enslave or obliterate the other species. God had unfortunately randomised the least intelligent possible species - homo.</p>
<p>2.7  million years just to leave the hunter gatherer stage. This was a new record. He had had to wipe out his first few species of homo and start over - they had simply been too stupid. By the time he had rerandomised into homo-sapien he was at least 2.6 million years behind Dexicon. </p>
<p>What didnt help was that the homo-sapiens turned out to be incredibly aggresive. This would be useful for fighting other species, but they mainly killed each other! Oh how Dexicon and Zeermon laughed! </p>
<p>When he had finally researched the abilty to send a vassel to Earth to enlighten and guide the people, the earthlings did something unprecedented in stupidity - they decided to kill it.</p>
<p>Finally the humans became space able. At the time, God was pleased. They visited their local moon first, as expected. But the moon base never came. The colonisation of nearby planets never came. They regressed.</p>

<p>"Good for them," Zolforat commented as they observed humans farming the cradle of civilization. "Tools and agriculture? Why, they're looking positively sentient."</p>
<p>"Real moxy," Mefro, Zolforat's companion, agreed. "I can hardly understand how they manage to stand up like that!" It stamped its twelve hooves in emphasis. "And in <em>that</em> gravity? They're lucky to be more than a foot tall!"</p>
<p>Zolforat put the ship back into gear. "Real shame about them. If they ever had a chance to develop beyond simple tools, they might be quite interesting to meet." They zipped off toward their final destination and forgot about the rapidly-spinning blue planet in almost no time.</p>
<hr />
<p>"I say, <em>those</em> are the humans?" Zolforat gasped on the way toward refueling in the atmosphere of one of Jupiter's moons. Down on the surface, they observed a city of over a million right in the center of an oddly shaped peninsula. Boats of wood sailed the seas, and stone roads criss-crossed the continent. "Well I'll be damned! They developed this much in just a few thousand orbits?? Why, look at all that!"</p>
<p>"Stone buildings!" Mefro whispered, awestruck. "In <em>that</em> gravity? Can you imagine?"</p>
<p>Zolforat was astounded. "I know! But cheers to them for making it this far! Glad we got to see them at their peak!"</p>
<hr />
<p>"What in the... Mefro, you've got to see what they've done now!" The two had made quite the hobby of watching the poor backwards humans. It was inspiring, watching them try their hardest. But also depressing, knowing that they were trapped on that little rock for the rest of time. "They're using <em>steam</em> for power!"</p>
<p>Mefro seemed impressed. "Clever little devils! I kind of almost want to see them try to make it to orbit."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't say that," Zolforat chided his companion. "There isn't enough water on the planet to produce enough steam to make it into orbit. They wouldn't even hit the second atmosphere layer before plummeting back down. Poor little guys."</p>
<p>"I know," Mefro said. "You're right; I shouldn't have said that. I'm just proud of them for making it this far." The two had developed almost <em>paternal</em> feelings for the poor little human buggers. </p>
<p>"Farewell, humans!" Zolforat told them as the two went off on their way again. "What do you think, Mefro: will they have discovered electricity by the time we return?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Their ship hovered over the burnt remains of a city on an island in the little blue planet's largest ocean. Scanners confirmed what the two already feared: radioactive fallout. This had been a <em>nuclear</em> detonation. Surveillance video from the drone they'd left in orbit showed another chilling discovery: long-range rockets traveling a distance of over 200 miles, packed with explosives. It should have been impossible with that level of gravity, but the damned humans had done it. With just a little more power, one of those could break orbit! On the surface, <em>millions</em> upon <em>millions</em> of humans teemed on every continent, in unimaginable numbers. And it was getting more and more crowded by the second. </p>
<p>"Uh...." Zolforat finally managed to take four of his eyes off of the screen to look back at Mefro. "We... uh... we should probably tell someone about this."</p>

<p>Score: 1708</p>
<p>I’m not an animal person. I swear that every single cat that I’ve ever crossed paths with has plotted my murder; the circumstances of my premature death leave open the possibility that one of them succeeded… stainless steel food bowls don’t push themselves off of 5th floor balconies. So when I entered the Eternal Judgment Court room, and saw a smug looking Sphynx eyeing me with hate-filled eyes, I knew I was fucked.
Countless “witnesses” were called, all of them silver tongued felines with nothing but disparaging accounts against my character; they recounted slights I committed against animal kind, that I didn’t even remember or believe were true.</p>
<p>“I once saw the defendant kick a pigeon.”</p>
<p><em>Complete bullshit</em></p>
<p>“The defendant has been known to attempt to run various cats over with his vehicle.”</p>
<p><em>Another false allegation</em></p>
<p>“The defendant once tortured a naive kitten for hours with The Red Dot!”</p>
<p><em>OK, that one is true</em></p>
<p>Even the more friendly dogs had little to say about me, and what good they tried to add on my account was brushed aside by the Sphynx as “most likely embellished flattery”. But at least they tried to stick up for me. Every type of animal I had ever interacted with in my entire life was called to testify, and after days it seemed that nothing would be said to grant me eternal happiness. I was to be damned for all eternity by the very breed of despicable little creatures that ended my time on earth.</p>
<p>The Sphinx raised his gavel, “If no other animal has any testimony to proffer on behalf of this human then by my rights as Supreme Judge of Animal Kind I hereby…”
“Wait!” A low and small voice says, from the floor behind be.
I turn around to see a small turtle pushing his way through the large courtroom doors.
“Wait… I have… something to say.” The turtle pants as he crawls forward, finally free of the doors. “I was sunbathing on a log one day, when some mean kids came and picked me up and started tossing me around,” </p>
<p><em>Oh great, am I supposed to have been one of these little hooligans?</em></p>
<p>“One dropped me, and I landed on my back. I was helpless, and they just laughed. But this human, he came over and yelled at the other kids until they went away. Then he picked me up, and carried me back to my log and set me back down in the sun.”</p>
<p>I was stunned; until now I had completely forgotten about that day. I was six, maybe seven, and I had been at the lake with my family. Who knows where my parents were, they weren’t the most attentive parents in the world. But I had seen a group other kids tossing what I thought was a ball, and wanting to join in the fun had run over to them. When I got closer I saw that it wasn’t a ball they were tossing, but a turtle, and for some reason this enraged me and I flew into a fury, yelling and throwing sand at the other kids to “stop teasing the poor turtle.”
I looked at the small creature by my foot, tears beginning to well up in my eyes. “Thank you” I mouthed, too emotional to actually get the words out. The turtle just gave a small slow dip of his head.</p>
<p>“In light of this new testimony, the Eternal Judgement Court does so recognize that this human once offered vital assistance to a fellow animal, at potential risk to his own person.” My heart was lifting with every word. “However this one action does not erase a lifetime of malice towards other animal. The defendant is hereby sentenced to a lifetime of damnation.”</p>
<p><em>Shit, fucking cats.</em></p>

<p>Alexander walked through the gallery of The Bat. Generations of his family were portrayed as the Dark Knight of their time. Dressed in full armour and the cowl under their arm. Some had their respective Robin standing besides them. He stopped at the last portrait in the gallery. It portrayed the first Batman.</p>
<p>Alexander was looking the painting of Bruce Wayne in the eyes. That was quite the feat, considering the painting was over two and a half meters off the ground. The man in the picture was small compared to the latest Master of Wayne manor.</p>
<p>"Hello Bruce." Alexander whispered, looking into the grey eyes. Generations of Batmen had protected Gotham, Earth and the Solar System from the all evils that could be brought to bear. But it was still Bruce Wayne that was revered amongst his successors, and Alexander was his greatest fan.</p>
<p>"It's finally time." he continued, "The elders called me into the chamber last night. They initiated me into the order of the Bat. I'm the new Batman." Alexander looked around the gallery, checking he was alone before continuing. "I'm scared. I'm not nearly as strong as father, nor as fast as grandfather. I'm the first Batman in six generations who isn't physically better than the one before him." </p>
<p>His gaze had drifted down from the portrait to the ground. "But I am smarter than my dad. I've done better at school than him, I even have a doctorate. But that can't be enough to be Batman"</p>
<p>A cough was heard at the beginning of the hall. Alexander turned his gaze, worried that someone caught his confession, his fears. The sound originated from a slight man, long, thin and dressed in a fine black suit with white shirt. "Master Alexander." the man said in a crisp English accent. 
"Alfred..." Alexander answered softly, embarrassed and worried.</p>
<p>"I heard what you said there, Master Alexander." Alfred continued, stepping towards the young man.
"You're not going to tell father, are you?" Alexander asked worried. In the past, these confessions of weakness were not welcome in the Wayne family.</p>
<p>The butler smiled friendly and put his hand reassuringly on Alexander's shoulder. "Of course not, Master Alexander. Truth be told, I've heard these same worries from many of your ancestors over the years." Alfred gestured through the gallery of portraits. </p>
<p>"Your father was the strongest Batman Gotham ha ever seen, but he was brutal and unforgiving, like his father before him. But your great-grandfather, Derik Wayne, was not near as harsh. Every Wayne has lent their own ideas to the mantle of the Bat. But you remind me of the first Dark Knight."</p>
<p>Alfred smiled as he thought back. "Master Bruce was probably the smartest Batman we've had, though Masters Dick and Damian were not not far behind him. He was the master strategist for the Justice League and one of its chief scientists and detectives." His eyes looked up to find Alexander's. "And that, Master Alexander, is where I think you can shine as well. You will do great..."</p>
<p>Alfred's body disappeared as the AI with the butler's memories shut itself off, knowing it gave the encouragements that were needed. He had done so for generations.</p>

<p><em>I gotta get the fuck outta here before he discovers that I'm Supersonic Girl</em>, thought Carly Jackson to herself. </p>
<p>"And I'm coming for you. . ."</p>

<p>"So you might as well make it easier on everyone and come to meet me."</p>
<p>All thirty kids in the classroom -- each one of them endowed with a different set of superhuman powers -- shifted in their seats, looked around uncomfortably, and wondered what they would do. Each of them had just resolved to make their respective moves when the thin, bespectacled frame of Mr. Galvan stood up from behind his desk at the front of the room. </p>
<p>"Kids," said Mr. Galvan, "I know this may come as a shock to you. But I'm actually a superhero called The Galvanizer. Gravatrix is my archenemy. I'll be back in time for dismissal. Stay where you are and don't give Mr. Richards any problems. He can read minds, you know."</p>

Before it had even touched down a group of men jumped out of the door. Every officer involved in the standoff gasped: the Eh Team! Rumor had it that Canada's most notorious outlaw mercenaries used to be Mounties themselves, but got caught pulling off a robbery in the National Bank of Canada! And now they were <em>working</em> for the <em>Prime Minister</em>? </p>
<p>The leader of the Eh Team approached one of the officers on the scene. He wore a camouflage hunting jacket, had a nub of a cigar sticking out the side of his mouth, and carried his trusty hunting rifle. "I'm Colonel Smith. What's this all aboot, then? What's the situation?"</p>
<p>The officer managed to stammer his way through the explanation: Seven kidnappers were in the warehouse. Five on the bottom floor guarding the entrances, and two on the top floor, along with the Prime Minister's daughter. And they claimed to have set up booby traps for anyone trying to breach the building. </p>
<p>"Got it." As the members of his team took up positions around the perimeter, Smith snatched the megaphone out of the officer's hand. Then he stepped forward under the yellow tape and held it up to his mouth. "Hey, you all in there!"</p>
<p>Gun barrels poked out the window in response. "You got our money?" someone finally called out. </p>
<p>"No, no." Smith took the cigar from his mouth and extinguished it into the pavement. It was time for some <em>action</em>. "I just thought you all might want to know that the Prime Minister is really upset about this whole business. This kidnapping stuff? It's <em>really</em> rude, OK?"</p>
<p>The gun barrels lowered. "Gosh, we didn't even realize," one of the kidnappers called back. </p>
<p>"Yeah," Smith continued. "Really caused a lot of trouble for everyone. So why don't we all put the guns down and settle this like gentlemen over a pint of Moosehead?"</p>
<p>There was a brief silence... then the kidnappers emerged from the warehouse with the Prime Minister's daughter. </p>
<p>"We're really sorry," one of them told Smith. "We had no idea."</p>
<p>Smith shook the man's hand and grinned. "Hey, don't worry about it, bud. We all make mistakes, you know?" He signaled to a nearby officer. "Get us a two-four, won't you?"</p>
<p>The Eh Team, the kidnappers, and the Prime Minister's daughter all popped open their bottles of delicious beer and toasted to the Queen. Smith took a sip of the refreshing beverage and pulled another cigar from his pocket. "I love it when a plan comes together, eh?"</p>

<p>"All those years," said Joe, waving the shotgun, "you guys gave me shit for bringing my gun to D&amp;D."  </p>

<p>"You said my shotgun <em>scared</em> you. You said the Second Amendment didn't <em>matter.</em> But now, with a literal <em>orc</em> in the basement, I don't hear anybody complaining!"  </p>
<p>"Actually, Joe," said Grokk, selecting his words carefully, "as I recall, the Second Amendment thing was more your talking point than theirs. If you don't mind me saying."  </p>
<p>"Shut your mouth," snapped Joe. "I've seen your charisma stat. It's not going to work on me."  </p>

<p>"Oh, so you think Jared's a better fit?"  </p>
<p>On the table, a miniaturized version of their friend Jared ran terrified circles around a can of root beer, an equally-miniaturized kobold hot on his heels. </p>
<p>"eee miii mii eee meee!!" squeaked Jared.   </p>

<p>"I just want a fair chance," said Grokk. "Isn't that what this country was built on?"  </p>
<p>"Look," said Joe, "we're gonna power-level Jared. The moment he hits level 10, we're wishing things right back to the way they were."  </p>
<p>"Aw, come on, man," said Grokk. "Don't be like that."  </p>
<p>Joe glared.  </p>
<p>"Remember how I saved your Elf Ranger? Priscilla? I took a ballista bolt for her, Joseph!"  </p>
<p>The glare continued in all its unibrowed glory.  </p>
<p>"Look! If you let me stay, I'll tell you how to get <em>her</em> into the real world too! Wouldn't you like that? A tall, slender elf to keep you company during these frigid north-Florida nights?"  </p>

<p>"That's impossible," he said.  </p>
<p>"Well," said Grokk, "I'm here, aren't I?"  </p>
<p>Joe studied the orc's pleading face. He thought about his elf ranger, the drawings of her that he kept in the secret journal under his pillow back home... her long, slim legs... her preposterously-large, almond-shaped eyes...  </p>
<p>He put the shotgun down.  </p>

<p>"You know," Ivy started, stroking the purring ball of fur snuggled in her arms. "I always knew you were a crazy cat lady, Selina but this time you've lost it."</p>
<p>"Coming from the woman who treats plants better than she does people." I said from my spot at the windowsill. </p>
<p>Ivy looked up at me with a sad expression and I glanced away, observing the room instead. Her small apartment looked more like a greenhouse than a living area. Every wall had vines tracing up and down and potted flowers bloomed throughout. I had seen it all before, but I didn't want to meet her gaze right that moment. </p>
<p>"He's gone, Selina. When are you going to accept that?"</p>
<p>My nails dug into the palms of my hand hard enough for them to bleed. </p>
<p>"I'm not going to accept that, Ivy. There's no way he's lost to me. No way."</p>
<p>Ivy made an unintelligible sound of frustration. "Wake up already. I know you've been gone a while but the Joker, Freeze, Penguin and even Bane are already dead. And the Justice League is afraid. Hell, I'm afraid."</p>
<p>"Something bad happened," I said. "But I can bring him back."</p>
<p>"What did it? In three years no one has figured out what made him cross the line."</p>
<p>My hand unconsciously drifted across my stomach, remembering. "I already sent out an invitation." I said, changing the subject and reaching into my pocket. </p>
<p>"What kind of invitation?"</p>
<p>A light toss sent the phone across the room. Vines dropped from the ceiling to catch it and Ivy repositioned the black cat as she reached out for it. </p>
<p>"Password is catz." I said. "With a Z."</p>
<p>"Figures." She mumbled, tapping the screen. As soon as it was unlocked the video started to play and her eyes went wide. "You didn't, Selina. I didn't even think he was alive."</p>
<p>"Bruce keeps the man guarded like a president."</p>
<p>"Then how did you kidnap Alfred?" </p>
<p>"I'm a thief. I take things. And kidnapping sounds worse than it is. He's just at my apartment drinking tea."</p>
<p>"You're crazy. He's going to kill you."</p>
<p>"Maybe." I said, looking out into the night, knowing that there were only a few hours between me and seeing him again. "But I have to try."</p>
<hr />
<p>Lightning flashed across the sky and I sighed, knowing he was behind me. He hadn't made a sound, the night was his. Yet he had also been mine and I knew him like no one else. At least I thought I did. </p>
<p>"Where is he, Selina?" His voice rumbled like a storm cloud and I shivered in the warm rain. It was still familiar. </p>
<p>"Safe." I said, turning to face him. There was no more gray in his costume, it was all black. If not for the glowing eyes he would've been invisible against the wall he leaned on. I knew it was for my benefit that he was even letting himself be seen. </p>
<p>"Don't make me take him from you."</p>
<p>"You need to get a grip Bruce. None of this is you. Everyone in the city is afraid. What happened to-"</p>
<p>"The city is safe!" He yelled and I jumped in surprise. I'd never seen him lose his cool so quickly. "Safer than it ever was when those madmen were running around."</p>
<p>"At what cost?" I asked. "You can't keep this up Bruce. Sources tell me you barely even sleep anymore and the morgue is filling up faster than the prison."</p>
<p>"You mean Alfred."</p>
<p>"I do, he loves you Bruce. I love you. We want you to come back to us, leave the Bat behind."</p>
<p>There was a heavy silence between us, filled by the falling rain. </p>
<p>"You left, Selina." He said finally. "Now you have the nerve to come back and tell me this?" </p>
<p>My throat constricted and I turned back to the skyline, unable to look at him in that moment. Memories assaulted me with enough strength to put me on my knees. My stomach heavy, Bruce's smiling face whenever he felt the kicks, the laughter of a madman ringing out while I lay bleeding followed by the ragged scream of a man who had lost one thing too many. </p>
<p>I cleared my throat best I could but my words still came out as a whisper. "I couldn't handle it, Bruce. It wasn't fair to you and I hate myself for it but all I could do was run. Run from the sadness in your eyes, the pain of knowing what we had lost. I ran from the city itself, this place has taken everything from me. Even you."</p>
<p>Silence answered me again and I spun, wondering if he had disappeared while my back was turned. Instead I came face to face with his huge form standing inches away from me. Mask covering whatever was going through his head.</p>
<p>"I know why you ran." He said, voice revealing nothing. "And I took all of our pain out on this city. It deserved to bleed. It still does. Yet here you are."</p>
<p>"Here I am." I whispered. "I've come back to you Bruce. I never should have left."</p>
<p>"Bruce died on the same night as our child, Selina. There's nothing left of him."</p>
<p>I reached out slowly and put my hand against his chest. When he didn't move I wrapped my arms around him, not caring that I wouldn't be able to defend myself if he was too far gone. This was my only chance.</p>
<p>"I don't believe you." I said into his chest. "If Bruce is dead, then you can leave right now. Alfred will have already returned to the manor. But if any trace of you is still in there...hold me. That's all I ask."</p>
<p>I don't know how long I stood there, soaking up the rain. The man I had my arms around was like a statue, he barely breathed. Minutes passed before I felt him grab my shoulders to push me away. And I was glad for my own mask as my heart shattered once again. Except he didn't let go, he just stood there, holding me at arm's length. </p>
<p>"You can't leave again." He said. </p>
<p>"I won't. Never again."</p>
<h2>Then his arms pulled me forward and crushed me in a hug that I never wanted to end.</h2>
<h1>[WP] For years Earth cried out to an empty cosmos, searching the stars for echoes of life. From the middle of nowhere, a reply finally comes: "Shut up, and Play Dead!"</h1>
<p>Score: 1399</p>
<p>Scholars never ceased to write about how amazingly fast humanity came together when an existential threat was proven to loom over our continued existence. </p>
<p>We first received The Signal about 30 years ago, right when I had first joined the SETI team. After five years of painstaking work, linguists were confident that it translated to the English equivalent of “Shut Up, and Play Dead!” We had double checked our translation, running The Signal through dozens of double blind international teams, all working simultaneously to ensure accuracy and speed (I had sheepishly -- and wrongly -- suggested that maybe the aliens were just Jerry Garcia fans).</p>
<p>So, faced with such bluntness, we united. Humanity willingly set itself back nearly a hundred years to a pre-Information Age culture. Satellites came down and GPS went dark. No more internet or television signals beaming across the cosmos. The loose confederation of countries that had formed the U.N. now became a strict regulatory agency to ensure that no country took advantage of the global blackout and to enforce the one rule of our survival: stay quiet and don’t move a muscle.</p>
<p>I knew that across the world were many teams working on trying to parse out even a sliver of additional information from the message so they could figure out how to prepare for this unknown threat. However, above all, our team had been transformed from a barely funded back-of-the-envelope operation to the first line of defense. We had to keep scanning for new signals -- quietly.</p>
<p>Now, instead of doing it with bold detectors openly beaming bragging signals into space, I hide in a small bunker nearly a mile under the surface, painstakingly scanning the sky light year by light year. After much deliberation, the bigwigs in charge of humanity’s survival decided that masking our search as standard background radiation was a risk worth taking. We weren’t sending the signals, but we could keep scanning the sky, like a mouse keeping an eye out for a hawk from the top of its burrow. I’m all alone down here; just the machines sweeping the sky and me. I take month long shifts before being relieved and there are dozens of these hole-in-the-ground stations around the globe, all pointing at different parts of the sky.</p>
<p>My display screen has just started beeping. For first time in 30 years, I have caught a glimpse of the talons in the sky. The new signal comes in fast, 1s and 0s filling my screen. I quickly check the localizer and see that this time the message is coming from several light years in a different direction than our original Signal. What does this mean? Are our secret guardians on the move? Or has someone else found us? Did we accidentally twitch a limb and now the hawk is taunting us?</p>
<p>I’m simply supposed to relay the pure, untranslated signal to higher authorities, but I can’t help but see if the auto-translate they have installed in our machine can at least give me the essence of this new message. My heart is racing as I wonder at the depths of the prophecy I hold in my hands. The translation only takes a minute -- the code is the same as The Signal. Words begin to fill up my screen:</p>
<h2>“Third planet of Sol: why have you gone dark? Please don’t tell us you fell for that old [garbled name] trick; they just want to keep their trading monopoly in this area. Please signal back if you have any [list of elements begins to fill the screen].”</h2>

<p>Tommy, Todd, and Frank had never actually played Dungeons and Dragons before. But they knew that Luke was a huge fan of it, and so they had looked up a quick guide on google before inviting him over to play. It was kind of turning out to be a disaster, but they were doing the best that they could do. </p>
<p>Tommy acted as DM. Todd and Frank were both elves, which may or may not have made sense depending on the context. Luke was, indeed, the only one who knew what he was doing.</p>
<p>"Are you guys high or something?" he asked, as they played. The three other boys looked to each other, before Tommy cleared his throat and suddenly exclaimed, "Oh, Luke, you have come across an enemy!" </p>
<p>"It's not my tu--"</p>
<p>"An enemy!" Tommy exclaimed, using enthusiasm. "Oh, it is an evil um...witch?" he turned to Frank and Todd, giving them a look that asked, <em>Do witches exist in this game?</em> They both met his bewildered gaze in turn. Luke didn't pipe up, just waited for Tommy to finish talking.</p>
<p>"Yes. An evil witch. Named. Um. Livian."</p>
<p>"Livian like...Vivian?"</p>
<p>"No, no, no, not at all. Like Livian of olde. She was an ancient...um...sorceress...in--"</p>
<p>"Camelot?" Todd asked-rather-than-told.</p>
<p>"She was Merlin's arch nemesis," Frank piped up. </p>
<p>"No, that was Nimue or Viviane," Luke told them.</p>
<p>"Oh then definitely it's Viviane," Tommy said. "Yes. Viviane. She's known for being a manipulative bi---witch. Who kind of treats her boyfriends poorly. And doesn't appreciate them."</p>
<p>Luke just looked at Tommy. After a silence he said, "So am I going to roll to see who attacks first or...?"</p>
<p>"I'll roll," Tommy says. "Official house rules. And you can't look."</p>
<p>"Guys, what is this about?" Luke asked. </p>
<p>"Just let me roll," said Tommy. Luke closed his eyes and Tommy rolled the die. "Oh, you get to go first, I think!" Tommy exclaimed. </p>
<p>"Guys, is this about Vivian?" Luke asked.</p>
<p>The three others exchanged a look. Luke opened his eyes. "I'm not twelve years old with an IQ of 57. I know you guys don't know how to play this game."</p>
<p>"We looked it up for like ten minutes," Todd said. "It's kind of complicated and hard to learn on the fly."</p>
<p>"We don't like your girlfriend," Frank said. "And she treats you like crap, man. And you should break it off." </p>
<p>"And to try and make that point we tried to learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons for you, man," Todd said. </p>
<p>"Because we are good friends," Tommy said. </p>
<p>Luke looked at them. "You guys, Vivian broke up with me two weeks ago."</p>
<p>"Oh," Todd said. "Well uh...good, I guess." </p>
<p>"You guys want to get some pizza?" said Tommy. "I have no idea how to play this game." </p>
<p>"I'm game," said Frank.  </p>
<p>"Let's do it," said Todd.</p>
<p>"You guys really didn't know that Vivian dumped me?" asked Luke. </p>

<p>"Nothing." The reply was immediate and absolute. They were in the final phase of their training, and there was only one test left. Stav turned, his eyes sweeping up and down the faces of the clandestine service officers.</p>

<p>"I-I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about."</p>
<p>"No?" Stav reached into his pocket and took out a piece of paper, unfolding it. "How about a castle in Scotland?" </p>

<p>"And then we'll pay for a shopping spree at Chanel," the slow grin spread across his face as Yolanda's mouth dropped open, her hands clutching at her heart.</p>
<p>"Gregor is in the black site two hundred kilometers south of here!" she cried. "I can get you in!"</p>

<p>I had guarded over Doris for her entire life. It had been a long, and very productive run. I looked in through the hospital window to see her surrounded by her six children, twenty grandchildren and fifty-six great-grandchildren. It was a big hospital room.<br />
Her time had now come, and it was time to take her up to the big man. I slid open the window and climbed into the room, and much to my shock the people in the room looked over to me.<br />
“Who the fuck are you?”<br />
I froze. In my four thousand year career in service of Jehovah no human who wasn’t a pope or totally insane had ever tried talking directly to me. <br />
“Ur… can you see me?”<br />
“Of course I can, now what the fuck are you doing climbing in through my mother’s hospital window?” Spoke Jeremy, Doris’ oldest son. I had saved him from a rabid dog when he was 11.<br />
“I’m, uh, I’m your mother’s guardian angel. I’m here to take her to heaven.”<br />
“What are you? Some kind of pervert?” Said Giselle, one of Doris’ granddaughters. I had coordinated the prayer campaign to cure her pancreatic cancer a few years back.<br />
“No no no, I was sent by Jehova to bring Doris to ever-lasting bliss.”<br />
“That's sick mate, why don’t you fuck off back out your window?” Said Harold.   I’d prevented four drunk driving accidents that he should have caused in the last three months.<br />
His tone rather annoyed me, and I tried to push through to get to Doris.   “Honestly, I must insist you let me…” A fist collided with my face and I found myself flat on the floor.   </p>
<p>I woke up in the drunk tank. I started slamming on the door and a police officer appeared.<br />
“You have to let me go!” I yelled out to him. “I’m a servant of God!”<br />

<h1>[WP] You are cursed with ever aging immortality with the exception you can be killed using one object. Every few years you get a hint.</h1>

<p>Every five years, I receive a package in the mail. It comes even when there is no mail service, like when Sherman was rampaging his way through the South. A single delicately-crafted golden puzzle piece with intricate cursive handwriting on it. Taunting me, revealing bits and pieces of information of where I might find the <em>only</em> weapon that can kill an immortal. Each box comes wrapped in delicate red wrapping paper with a fine Italian silk ribbon, reminding me of my origins back in Europe. Back where I first met the witch. </p>
<p>Today, the last piece arrived. I had to have my assistant Luthor open the package, given that I can hardly move. See, unfortunately, immortality doesn't keep me forever young the way it does in fairy tales. No, I've kept on aging until I'm just a bitter, dried-out husk of a human being. I haven't left my bed since the American Revolution. I have, however, made several investments over the years that have given me the wealth needed to maintain a lavish lifestyle and a veritable army of servants to do my bidding.</p>
<p>Normally, I <em>hate</em> this day: April 8. It's a taunt from my eternal tormentor. But today is different: the final piece has come, 750 years to the date that I first gained this curse in a desperate bid to escape the Black Plague. I suppose the witch has decided that I've suffered enough. Or perhaps she has simply run out of ways to stall. With a soft <em>clink</em>, Luthor places the piece in the frame where I've collected all of the pieces over the years.</p>
<p>"What does it say?" I gasp. My voice sounds like a whisper of wind between corn stalks. I'm unable to open my eyes to read the inscription for myself. </p>
<p>"It says you need the sword of a crusader that has been blessed at the High Temple of Jerusalem," he answered. Luthor is one of the few servants that I've entrusted with my secret, in part because he can fluently read and speak Latin, which is what the clues are written in. </p>
<p>"That's all?" Somehow I'd expected it to be some sort of last challenge. Some famous king's blade, or some rare magical object. My bet was actually on the Holy Lance, which is why I went to such lengths to find and acquire it.  But <em>this</em> was nothing. I'd been collecting ancient weaponry ever since I amassed my fortune, hoping that I just might have the relic I needed when the time came. I had at least a <em>hundred</em> swords from crusaders, on both sides of the conflict. "Luthor, have them prepare the jet. We're going to Israel. And have any sword in the vault from the crusader period brought on board."</p>
<p>"Very good." I can hear him exit the room; thank god for modern devices like hearing aids. </p>
<p>I've wanted to kill myself for <em>centuries</em> now. I was already a hunched, bedridden old cripple even back when I first came to the Colonies. My mind is still sharp, but my body has withered away to nothing until it was just a prison. I'm not even a man anymore: most of my parts are artificial. I don't need them to keep me alive, but the doctors have done what they can to improve my quality of life. These puzzle pieces are the only thing that have kept me going; the only reason I have to live.</p>
<p>No, I don't look forward to them for the clues. That's certainly important, because I'll need the blessed sword. No, my main motivation now is <em>hate</em>. Hatred for the witch that did this to me, and has continued to torment me through the years. The witch that is as old as I am. And if that's the case, then maybe the sword won't just be good for killing me, though I know she expects me to take that out. I think I can hold on a little longer... at least until my small mercenary army finds her. I just hope that I still have the strength to hold the sword; I would like to end her myself, if at all possible.</p>

<h1>[WP] Humanity finally reaches the edge of the solar system only to encounter an impassible barrier and a warning not to try and breach it. But is it there to keep us in or to keep something else out?</h1>
<p>Score: 1187</p>
<p>Humanity was expanding.</p>
<p>It was time to go.</p>
<p>It had been 200 years since humans had reached the edge of the solar system. It had taken 2 years to journey that far back then, and now they could pass the expanse from the sun to the edge in just a few tens of minutes. But they could never pass it.</p>
<p>The great barrier hung, invisibly encompasing the system. When humans had first approached, not knowing the barrier was there, they were rocked by the strong magnetics fields. A signal had flashed across the whole of the visable spectrum. Lights turning on and off at high speed. They had found code easy to break, and understood it was a communication meant for them.</p>
<p>"Go back. Do not leave. Go back. Do not leave."</p>
<p>This had started an international crisis. Should they ignore it, and push through? The combined decision of the worlds elected leaders was no. At a vote tallying  90 to 60, the earth had decided to stay within the barrier.</p>
<p>The humans kept testing it. They found that both electromagnetic waves, and physical probes were allowed through, but anything containing biological matter was prevented from leaving. The first casualty of the barrier was one brave astronaut's ham sandwich. The testing continued, the message stayed the same, but then humanity moved on. </p>
<p>And then it expanded. First Mars, then Titan and orbital habitats around Venus and Jupiter. And they kept expanding. And in just 11 generations Humanity started to outgrow the resources of the solar system. </p>
<p>And so it came back to today. The day after polling day. Every human across the expanse of the solar system had been allowed to vote on the decision of whether or not to break through the barrier. The technology to do so had been available for 120 years.  </p>
<p>And the results came in. 96% voter turnout. 76:24 in favour of breaking through the barrier.</p>
<p>It was too late. They weren't ready yet. I couldn't even send another warning. It took all I had to maintain the barrier. I had tried. But they didn't even know what they were in for. I had watched them for so long, keeping them safe.</p>

<p>Bob Ross strapped into a leather chair, his hair bobbing ever so slightly. </p>
<p>"Are you sure about this, Bob? You could be killed. We need to be absolutely clear with you about the dangers present," the Time Delegation representative said firmly. "I know you've been training to speak German for some time in preparation, but if you find yourself unsure on the other side, disaster could befall us."</p>
<p>A warm smile crept across Bob's face. "I'm sure. You said this will prevent future catastrophe, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. It would likely allow for an Israeli state to be created with less haste, preventing the fighting and nuclear fallout that follows. I come from a time when that has already happened. We've tried to kill him, but it fails every time."</p>
<p>"I'd save millions in the past, and millions in the future. What better purpose could my life serve? I will try, my friend. Let's turn this mess into a beautiful, peaceful painting for the future."</p>
<p>The doors shut, engines whirred and within moments, Bob found himself in 1908 Austria outside of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where Hitler had just failed admission for the second time. Using several older photos for reference, he kept an eye on the entrance.</p>
<p>Several minutes later, Adolf stormed out of the building, throwing his paintings and screaming curses in German. Bob approached him once he'd sat down and cooled his head for a moment.</p>
<p>"Are you an artist?" Bob asked carefully.</p>
<p>Hitler looked up at him, sighing. "I am not. This school has rejected me twice now, so clearly I am no such thing."</p>
<p>"Schools have nothing to do with it; art comes from your soul. May I see your work? I am an artist as well."</p>
<p>Hitler pointed to the partially snapped painting on the ground. "I destroyed it in anger."</p>
<p>Picking it up, Bob verbally gaped at it. "This is incredible. You have extreme technical talent, unlike much I've seen."</p>
<p>"Thank you. Unfortunately, that's not enough, it seems."</p>
<p>"No, my friend. It's not. My name is Hans- what is yours?"</p>
<p>"Adolf. Are you from around here? Your accent is odd."</p>
<p>"I grew up overseas, but I love this country. Hey- do you have a studio?"</p>
<p>"I have a place I draw, yes."</p>
<p>"Can we maybe work a little together there? I think we could help each other."</p>
<p>Hitler looked down at the cement. "I quit art. There's nothing for me in this field."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's not true! You have too much talent to waste, friend. I would love a little help regarding precise measurements and detailed architecture. Schools are schools- don't let them tell you who you are."</p>
<p>Hitler marveled at Bob's warm smile and friendliness. "Sure. Yes, we can go now."</p>
<hr />
<p>They sat together in a small room, each with their own easel. Bob was scraping paint into a beautiful snowy forest, and Adolf was once again working on an architectural piece. </p>
<p>"Adolf, why don't you try mixing our ideas?"</p>
<p>"How do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, you draw amazing architecture, and I am a landscape master. I think if you drew a beautiful building against a backdrop of nature rather than a pure cityscape, I think it would give it life. See, a piece needs <em>life</em> and <em>personality</em> on top of skill. You are incredibly skilled, so much that you forget about the soul of it."</p>
<p>Adolf chewed on that for a moment, while continuing his building. He accidentally stroked too hard, leaving a blemish on the rooftop.</p>
<p>"Shit. Ah, see, I always mess up. Now I have to start over."</p>
<p>Bob smiled, placing a hand on his shoulder. "There are no mistakes, just happy little accidents." He swiped the blemish into an accent, shaping it into a bird and adding color.</p>
<p>"It's about the feeling, Adolf. It's about <em>you</em>."</p>
<p>He smiled and they continued to paint the day away.</p>

<h1>[WP] You are an archaeologist and have just dug up a dinosaur. That's because you've dug up an entire museum.</h1>
<p>Score: 1058</p>
<p>"Woah! A dinosaur!" I exclaimed as I gently put my shovel down. A tiny creature, no taller than a few inches, crawled out from a miniscule burrow in the sand at the bottom of the excavation site. I retrieved a magnifying glass from my satchel and used it to have a better look at the small creature. </p>
<p>It was a dark shade of green. Almost brown and slightly mottled in places. Curiously, it had a light coat of tan-coloured feathers covering its backside. The plumage glistened in the afternoon sunlight and even had an orange tinge to it at certain angles. The dinosaur crawled up on to my outstretched index finger and began awkwardly waddling up my glove.</p>
<p>"Fascinating," muttered my companion as he looked over my shoulder and watched the little critter crawl. "What else did we uncover?" He squatted down and used a smaller tool to brush away more of the dirt around the site where the dinosaur had crawled out of. No sooner had he done so when I heard a sharp <em>clack!</em> </p>
<p>"That sounds like you hit something. A buried chest?" I asked as the dinosaur hopped up and down on my open palm.</p>
<p>"Looks more like a small building than a treasure chest," my friend replied. He used a brush to dust off some dirt from the object. "Well I'll be darned."</p>
<p>It was a fancy looking building about the size of a mailbox or a large bread box. It was two stories tall and the bottom story was lined by a series of pillars that held the upper floor up. A small plaque near the entrance had the word <em>Museum</em> engraved on it. I put the dinosaur into a glass jar with air holes poked into the top before I went to have a closer look at the building.</p>
<p>With my magnifying glass hovering outside the windows of the museum, I peered inside. But before I could make anything out clearly, something flew out of one of the open windows. I stumbled backwards and swatted my hand around my face, thinking it was an insect. When I finally regained my composure, I saw a tiny spaceship darting around the outside of the museum. It flew around, bumbling about like a bee, before finally landing adjacent to my dinosaur jar.</p>
<p>"Gosh, this is amazing! We've stumbled onto a whole miniature museum full of surprises!" I said joyfully.</p>
<p>"Indeed!" replied my friend. "I can't believe we found all of this on our first try!"</p>
<p>"There's treasure everywhere!" I announced happily.</p>
<p>"Calvin!" yelled a female voice in the distance. "Come on in! It's time for dinner!"</p>
<p>"C'mon Hobbes. Better head back in before Mom throws a fit," I said to my tiger friend. I took him by his tail and dragged him out of the sandbox.</p>

<p>It just started as kind of a joke. I didn't actually think it would work. I read that XKCD comic, <strong><a href="http://xkcd.com/525/">I know you're listening</a></strong>.

<p>I started out by saying things that the audience might expect someone to say in a monologue, thinking that if it seemed like it was <em>supposed</em> to be a part of the script, then maybe it would get through. And for a while, it worked. I heard the laughs, and their responses back. </p>
<p>But after about a week, nothing. No more feedback. I've tried changing what I say, how I say it. I tell jokes. I sob and cry. But as far as I can tell, it's not getting through.

<p>I loved her, he says out loud when he starts writing her a letter:  </p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a girl. This girl, like most girls when they're 20 years old, has issues. She worries about the future, she worries because she has no idea what she wants to become. She thinks that happiness in life comes from the things she does and accomplishes. However, when all her work is done, she feels empty inside. She feels the burning sensation that might soon become a depression. When the work is done, so is she.  </p>
<p>Most importantly though, she believes that love is all about the butterflies she feels in her stomach. She does not believe in a God, per se, but she does believe that when she dies, she will be like a star, shining down upon us in the night.  </p>
<p>One day, she meets a man on the internet. She looked at his pictures and figured: what the hell, he looks good enough. She started chatting with him, started telling him all about her problems and he did the same. They fell in love.  </p>
<p>However, after a little while, she started losing her butterflies, as expected. She did not know whether the man was actually the cause of this or because she simply did not feel those wonderful feelings anymore.  </p>
<p>She started doubting him, hell, she even tried to change him. You see, he was a smoker. He was the kind of person who would live his life from day to day, and not worry about the past or the future. Someone who would risk his life, just so that he could die having lived a happy life.  </p>
<p>She did not understand why he would take those kinds of risks in life. After all, he knows well enough how painful and agonizing the death of a smoker can be.
She did not understand how someone would risk his or her life just to be happy. She did not understand happiness or what it meant simply because she never quite found out what made her happy.  </p>
<p>As time went on, and her workload increased, she started neglecting him. After all, university is her priority at the moment. In doing so, she made him question her.  </p>
<p>Why doesn't she want to go out anymore? Why doesn't she want to take a midnight walk with me? Undeniably so, he always sacrificed himself so that she could go on with a smile on her face. He did not understand why she could not make an hour of her time free to simply go out and have a drink. After all, the café was only 2 minutes away from her front door.  </p>
<p>As with any love story, things did not end well. Right before the end though, she even made him believe that because he started doubting her, that she did not love him anymore, while in reality she stopped loving him a long time ago but simply could not find the courage within herself to break his heart. After all, he was the kind of guy who would have died for her.  </p>
<p>So she said to him: Let's take a break. Let's just be ourselves for a while and see what happens. He simply did not understand. For three long weeks, he could not eat. He could not sleep and he could not even sit at his computer and play video games. She was on his mind 24/7. The entire day he would eagerly wait for a text message from her. She never sent one.  </p>
<p>But after those three weeks, he started seeing things differently. She was right. By becoming himself again, he finally understood why she left him. He could finally understand that in fact it wasn't because he doubted her, but because she does not understand the true meaning of love. He finally understood why she tried to change him.  </p>
<p>He wrote this story for her, not because he wanted to but because he needed to. He wrote this so that she could find her happiness in life, so that she could finally understand what love is and so that she could finally stop breaking peoples hearts. In the end though, he didn't do it for her, he did it for her future husband.
He wrote: "Once upon a time, there was a girl.."  </p>
<p>As he gave her the letter, and watched her read it, he felt those old emotions again. That stinging feeling of happiness and love. The idea that he can have a future with this person. He felt like he could have given her a different kind of letter. Maybe this was his chance to make things right again. Alas, the outcome would have been the same, he thought to himself.  </p>
<p>After she was done reading the letter, she bursts into tears, understanding exactly what the man had given her and asked him to hug her one last time. It was the most emotional hug of his life and as he left her there, he finally felt closure.  </p>

<p>Steeling himself for battle, Sir Galilwayne approached the mouth of the cave. The deep grunts of the sleeping dragon inside could be heard half a mile off. As soon as he entered the cave, he saw it: the Nameless One. Slayer of Sir Twainpac, Sir Fiddy Pence, and many other good knights. Strewn amongst the dragon's golden hoard were several suits of armor much like Galilwayne's own.</p>

<p>"Shit, son, you just got burned so bad you wouldn't even taste good. Just run off back to Camelot, yo."</p>

<p>Bruce Wayne stood stoically, looking at the footage from his arsenal of security cameras. He watched as an ever-growing crowd of reporters gather around his property, eager to find out even more about the man behind the cowl. They, at least, weren't making any attempt to hide. He wasn't very concerned about any darker dangers slowly creeping their way towards his old family manor, nor did he worry about any of his friends or family coming under threat from any of his old rogue's gallery. After all, there wasn't really anyone he could call a true friend at that point. </p>
<p>With one exception. He expected his dearest of companions, Alfred, to cheerily remind him the bat mobile was primed and ready to go, for his escape to be ready at any moment. Of course, he knew this would never come. He sighed deeply, thinking of his old butler, in a coma, and likely to remain that way for the remainder of his days, but a shadow of his former self. Bruce pushed these thoughts out of his mind for now, and instead thought of how he got himself into his predicament. </p>
<p>Defending the innocent wasn't cheap, especially not in the dark, amoral backwaters of Gotham, a city ridden with poverty and crime. If he was to continue with his nightly crusades, he needed more funds. How hilarious, the aging hero thought. He had gone up against cold mobsters, murderous sadists, monsters from hell, aliens, conquerors bent on world domination, and even the coming of the apocalypse itself; but alas, his greatest enemy was taxes. In order to overcome this most harrowing of foes, he resolved to create an offshore oil account, linked directly to Wayne Enterprises. Of course, Wayne Enterprises had no stake in the oil industry, but the Batman needed his supplies, and so it went. Money was laundered with this excuse, tax-free, which meant maximum revenue. At first, it was just a small percentage of his gains, but eventually it was where most of his income came from. He could continue to save the lives of the people he loved so dearly, without having to worry about dwindling finances.</p>
<p>Then, it all fell apart. The papers were leaked. Collapsing, falling, his identity was figured out, with sly journalists connecting the dots. His schemes, and the schemes of many others, were exposed to the public eye, for all to see. The dots were connected. He was discovered. Now, here he was, watching his entire life's work fall apart, his company investigated and torn apart, his mansion overwhelmed with reporters and police. Nobody had actually entered into his courtyard or into the interior of his home, but his live feed was showing the people were getting ready to do just that. Everyone wanted to talk to Batman, after all. Their hero.</p>
<p>It was all a farce. His greatest enemies always came back, regardless of what he did. It seemed like for every crook he put up, three more took their place. His hand hovered over a red button labeled only <em>destruct.</em> He had no reluctance. He knew would rid the world of his legacy if he had to. This was such a moment. He pressed the button.</p>
<p>The world watched in awe as Wayne Manor leaped into flames. Everything was destroyed. Anyone inside would be vaporized. Some of the people closer to the mansion experienced burns, and the shock wave was heard from miles around. The property was replaced with a large crater, with only the walls on the farthest edges of the once mighty homestead still remaining. The bat cave, and everything he had worked to achieve, was eviscerated. The Batman was no more.</p>
<p>In a shack in northern Canada, Bruce Wayne laughed for the first time in as long as he could remember. His plan had worked, as he knew it would. Whenever he contacted various news outlets regarding his money scheme, the pieces were set. The clues he laid out regarding his identity were obvious, his biggest concern being that someone like Batman would even leave such a clear trail. Of course, that didn't really matter now. He thought about the last thing Alfred had said to him.</p>
<p>"Stay true to yourself. Be who you want to be, not what others want you to be."</p>
<p>That part of his life was over. He shut off his computers. He looked out the window in his small house, the blank snow covering the landscape. Down the road, he could see a small fishing town situated right on the coast of the Atlantic, it slowly coming alive. This was the peaceful life he desired. Nobody would find him here, he made sure of it. As far as the world was concerned, Bruce Wayne was dead.</p>
<p>The myth of the dark knight lives on.</p>

<h1>[WP] You are in a zombie apocalypse, and are attacked by a horde of zombies and bitten. As you panic, you notice the zombie turning into a human.</h1>
<p>Score: 823</p>
<p>Six months. Everybody who had ever fantasised about a zombie apocalypse had imagined how long they would last. I was a realist, I had never thought I would get beyond two months, but in the end I managed to last three times that. All the more impressive because I was protecting my little sister.</p>
<p>We had been holding up in an old gas station, but this one summer’s night it was all going to come to an end. A breeze must have carried our scent towards the horde, we were getting pretty ripe. Around midnight the banging started on the door, I locked Lisa in the back room and sat guard with my dad’s old Colt. Usually the banging stopped after a few hours, but this night the zombies were persisting past day break.</p>
<p>Eventually the hinges gave way and a dozen zombies swarmed into the room, and began pouring towards me. I took down three of the shamblers before they reached me and knocked me to the floor. That was a new highscore. A male zombie bit into my leg, chewing off a huge chunk of flesh. I screamed in pain, as the other zombies started chowing down.</p>
<p>Through my tears I could see something happening to the zombie who bit me first. His skin was de-greying, his hair grew thicker and his eyes became clear and alert. He picked up the Colt and took out three of the other zombies.</p>
<p>“Where are the bullets?” he asked me. I patted to my left hand pocket. He reached in, loaded the gun back up and fired four more times.</p>
<p>“Is there anybody else here?” he asked. I hesitated before telling him about Lisa, but decided this stranger could do more for her now than I could.</p>
<p>“My little sister, back room, the key’s under the counter,” I said, blood spluttered on my lips, one of the zombies had taken a good chunk from my neck.</p>
<p>The man walked away from my line of vision, and as I heard him fiddling with keys I began to drift away. Until I heard the scream, Lisa screaming. With all my effort I turned around to see the man standing over Lisa, allowing another zombie to bite into my sister.</p>
<p>I tried to scream, but realised I had stopped breathing several minutes ago. I stared at the other zombie as she began her transformation back to humanity. Blond hair sprouted from her head and pink returned to her cheeks. She blinked her newly blue eyes and stood up to kiss the man.</p>
<p>As they embraced I could feel myself slipping away and an all-encompassing hunger started to consume my mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>I came to with a zombie standing over me. She was missing chunks of flesh and no longer had the happy glow about her, but I knew it was Lisa. I struggled to stand, everything was more difficult now. I took Lisa’s hand and lead her out of the gas station.</p>
<p>I could smell human on the wind, if we could get flesh I knew Lisa and I could start over.</p>

<h1>[WP] You somehow end up dating death. However, you have to deal with God and The Devil being overprotective older siblings.</h1>
<p>Score: 788</p>
<p>I was confused at first. Both God <em>and</em> the Devil told me it was a bad idea. Strange, to see them agree on something. They were both my elders, and both had shared responsibility for my well-being. God told me it was too rash to date Death. The Devil declared the union shouldn't have been possible. Not couldn't. <em>Shouldn't.</em> But what could I do?<br />
I loved Death.<br />
The broken things were what attracted me. Those minute moments. Loud silences. Death wandered from place to place as God willed. I followed. At first, because the path was blessed. Later, because I loved the chase. I felt the most <em>alive</em> being where Death was. <br />
So where Death passed, I stuck around for a while. Reveling in the remembered life that passed there.      <br />
It took long enough to get noticed. 
Then we shared, and walked together. Both the broken and the unbroken things about each other. For one thing, we liked wandering. Travelling aimlessly from place to place, experiencing the fullness of lives that once thrived on God's good Earth. The Devil watched, mindful that I was not straying from my own tasks (as older siblings do), but neither of them really understood. Too concerned with my well-being, that they didn't realize how... <em>perfect</em> this was. <br />
My job was at its most fulfilling in Death's shadow.<br />
For that, I loved Death.  <br />
And Death loved me. For who and what I was, not what I did. Such a miracle. A blessing. Of course this was where I wanted to be.  <br />
<em>Alright, but we warned you.</em>    <br />
I felt the most alive being where Death was.<br />
<em>So be it.</em>  <br />
What could I do but love Death for that?<br />
<em>Good luck, Memory.</em>  </p>

<p>Score: 748</p>
<p>"What about you, Toby? What do your parents do for a living?"</p>
<p>"Well, my mom goes out at eleven at night and comes back at seven full of glitter on her body. She tells me she's a 
clown at the circus! And dad has a bunch of guns and he sells this big packs of really white sugar to people who come to our house, so he's a coffee cop, I guess."</p>
<p>The teacher pressed her lips together and raised her eyebrows. "Okey!" she said, turning to Jim. "Jimmy, what 
about you?"</p>
<p>Jim thought back on his mother and father. "Well..." </p>
<p>He wanted to tell the class that his father had once been the famous superhero Power Dude. And he wanted to tell everyone that his mother had been the notorious supervillain Lady Psycho. He wanted to tell the whole class about how his father and mother fought for years all across Alpacatown, until the day their real life personas – Eric and Ellie – fell in love and got married. After marrying the love of her life, Lady Psycho never attacked the city anymore. And Power Dude decided he had better things to do with his time than dressing in spandex and chasing petty thieves.  So, a few years after Jimmy was born, they both retired their costumes, without ever finding out each other's identities.</p>
<p>Jim wanted to tell all that to the class -- but not even his parents knew that he knew about their secret identity. Let alone other people.</p>
<p>"Jimmy?"</p>
<p>Jim looked up. Mrs. Williams was smiling. "My dad's a lawyer," he said. "And my mom's an architect."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back home, Power Dude and Lady Psycho – or, as they were dressed at the moment, Eric and Ellie – were fighting 
again. While Jim ate his dinner in silence, his mother was going on and on about how Eric never listened to her. 
She was going on and on about how he was distant lately and how he wasn't the same. Eric, on the other hand, was going on and on about how Ellie only thought of herself and her needs, and never saw things his way.</p>
<p>The usual fight. Jimmy had a memory of his parents fighting a lot less, back when they still had their secret night jobs. Now it was just argument after argument, every day.</p>
<p>In a way, it was kind of better when they beat the shit out of each other in costumes -- there would be no anger left in either of them by the time they got home to their real selves.</p>
<p>Ellie got up from the dinner table, turned away and heavy-stepped towards the window. Eric crossed eyes with Jim, then looked down at his plate.</p>
<p>And then Jim had an idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're saying there's a show and tell at school about superheroes and villains?"</p>
<p>Jim nodded at his parents. "And I wanted to take Power Dude and Lady Psycho!"</p>
<p>His parents exchanged looks. "Well, Jim… we don't know Power Dude and Lady Psycho…"</p>
<p>"Plus," his mother added, "they both retired a long time ago, Jim."</p>
<p>Jim put on his best sad face. "Yeah… I guess I'll just go with my Superman action figures…"</p>
<p>On his way to his bedroom, he glanced back at his parents. They were exchanging looks.</p>
<p><em>Excellent.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And this is my Lex Luthor." Jim showed the action figure to the bored classroom. He looked out the window. Still 
nothing.</p>
<p>His father had told him that he had 'called' Power Dude about the show and tell, but couldn't promise anything 
about Lady Psycho. His mother hadn't said anything about it, but Jim had spotted her glancing at her supervillain 
costume hidden in her closet while she thought he was asleep.</p>
<p>"And this…" Jim continued, grabbing the Wonder Woman action figure. "Is Wonder –"</p>
<p>The window burst in a million pieces, and Power Dude's imposing figure climbed through. He stopped by Mrs. 
William's desk and, fists resting on his hip, looked around the classroom: "I understand I was called for a show and 
tell here. Who is Jim!?"</p>
<p>The classroom was ecstatic. Everyone cheered. Power Dude walked confidently to the center of the room and –</p>
<p>"So we meet again, Power Dude…"</p>
<p>The faces turned to the door. There, dressed in the black and white suit she hadn't put on in years – Lady Psycho.</p>
<p>Jim smiled.</p>
<p>"So we meet again…" Power Dude said, in a low tone. Husband and wife stepped towards one another like Clint 
Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef in a 60's spaghetti western. Somewhere in Italy, Ennio Morricone whistled.</p>
<p>Jim watched as his parents stopped eye to eye in front of the class. Lady Psycho pulled her laser gun.</p>
<p>Power Dude laughed. "That thing doesn't even work anymore!"</p>
<p>Lady Psycho turned the gun in her hand and checked something on the back. "You know what, it really doesn't. It's way past the expiration date." She looked up. "It doesn't matter! I can destroy you with my bare hands!"</p>
<p>Around the classroom, the kids started clapping and chanting: 'Fight! Fight! Fight!'</p>
<p>Mrs. William looked kind of startled. She was filming the whole thing with her phone, nonetheless. Power Dude and Lady Psycho back at work? This was huge news!</p>
<p>And then Lady Psycho threw her fist. Power Dude avoided it. He kicked, she crouched. The fight went on and on as 
they stumbled through the four corners of the room, knocking chairs and notebooks and desks all around.</p>
<p>In the end, Power Dude managed to overpower Lady Psycho, and the city was safe one more time.</p>
<p>"I'll be back, Power Dude!" Lady Psycho said, at the door. "I'll be back to conquer this city once and for all!"</p>
<p>Bruised and on the floor, but with a smile on his face, Power Dude looked up. "I'll always win, Lady Psycho! The city 
is safe with me!"</p>
<p>And then she was gone. Soon after, Power Dude followed, leaving behind the promise that he would return and the 
kids could sleep safe at night knowing their hero was back.</p>
<p>Everyone clapped. Jim got an 'A'. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night there was no fighting around the dinner table, but rather an amusing and amicable conversation about the return of the city's famous superhero and villain.</p>
<p>"I wonder if she's back for good," Eric said casually, avoiding his wife's gaze.</p>
<p>"Well... if <em>he's</em> back for good I'm guessing she is too," Ellie replied.</p>
<p>Jim got up. "Well, I'm off to bed. Good night mom, good night dad," he said, on his way to his bedroom.</p>
<p>"Good night, honey."</p>
<p>Jim pushed the door. Before closing it completely, he watched his parents caring for each other's wounds on the 
couch. He saw them smile and kiss, then turn to the TV, hands around each other's shoulder.</p>
<p>Jim closed the door, smiled and went to bed.</p>
<p>Power Dude and Lady Psycho were back.</p>

<p>"Get a move on!"</p>
<p>The butt of the rifle hit my stomach as I felt the air crash out of my lungs.  I struggled to breathe and felt myself being thrown into the center of the room.  I winced in pain, finding myself surrounded by several of the other tourists and the captain of the yacht. </p>
<p>The other sailors, however, pointed their rifles at us.  As a person who watched any action movie, I knew that they were AK47s - the perfect mass-produced gun.  They also never jammed.</p>
<p>"We're kind of fucked, aren't we?" I hissed jokingly at the woman next to me.</p>
<p>"How are you finding this funny?" she glared at me incredulously, "As an unemployed freak, maybe you should ask one of them for a job, huh?"</p>
<p>"Like I said, I'm a freelance jack-of-all-trades," I muttered, "It's not like you're doing anything with your-"</p>
<p>"Quiet down!" one of the sailors fired his rifle into the air as he ordered through a thick accent, "Shut up!"  </p>
<p>The gunshot rung throughout my ears, echoing off the walls of my head as I tried to concentrate.  As the noise subsided, I took a look at our captors.  A small group of dark-skinned sailors, my guess native Brazilians from the mainland. </p>
<p>"Man, I should've never taken that free boat trip..." I muttered.  There was an explosive pain as one of the sailors smacked his palm across my face, a burning sensation as I began to feel drowsy.  Luckily with years of being a crash-test dummy, I knocked off the trauma and stared intently at the sailor who had stepped into the middle of the cabin.</p>
<p>"You are all hostages!" the ringleader announced, "We are holding you ransom from your respective governments, each of you for $1 million."  A quiet murmur ran through the passengers as the man fired his rifle into the air again.  There were several screams as I felt plaster and dust fall onto me.  Several of the others coughed around me, but with my last job as a demolitions expert for construction, dust didn't seem to bother me anymore.</p>
<p>"Sir?"  I raised my hand tentatively, "Can I ask a question?"</p>
<p>I feared the worst, but the sailor grunted as he walked towards me.  "What is it?"</p>
<p>I remembered as I walked onto the boat earlier that day how the sailors had all been listening to the radio of a Palmeiras game, a local Division B team for Brazilian soccer.  From my experience as a second-division score tracker for various sports, I knew the team.  Combined with my lessons as an improvisation teacher, I could pull this off.</p>
<p>"<em>Meu!</em> [buddy]" I smiled, "Can you at least turn on the radio?  Palmeiras has some big transfer news coming up!"</p>
<p>The man lowered his rifle and chuckled.  "You are American, you know nothing."</p>
<p>"Meu!  Palmeiras is my favorite team!" I gave him a cheeky grin, "Can a <em>gringo</em> not enjoy the beautiful game?"</p>
<p>The two of us chuckled, but the sailor quickly raised his gun again as his face became alert.  "What is this news?"</p>
<p><em>Come on, what was his name?  What was his name?</em></p>
<p>"Ze Roberto, man!" I laughed, remembering the captain of the team, "They say he's leaving the team for Europe!"  Ze Roberto was worshiped by any supporter, and I knew that no matter how much he doubted me, the sailor would haveto check.</p>
<p>He handed his rifle to one of the others as he pulled out his radio from his pocket.  I knew I didn't have long as he continued to adjust the channel.  I eyed out of the corner of my eye and counted the guns - four of them.  Too many to make a move.  No matter how many years I spent managing a judo dojo, it would be useless.  If they suspected anything, I was dead.  It was that simple.</p>
<p>"I hear no news!"  the leader was confused as he continued to adjust the device.</p>
<p>"Here, you have to go to the main channel."  I nodded at him.  Nervously, he tossed me the radio.  I quickly switched on the open transmission-line as nobody seemed to have noticed what I had done.  Anything I said would be sent to any radio within a five-mile radius.  We were only several minutes away from land, so hopefully the port authorities could react. </p>
<p><em>Thank God for those four months as a radio tech.</em></p>
<p>"Here we go!" I muttered, "Now despite the fact that <strong>you kidnapped us, we can still listen to the Palmeiras transfer!  I'm so glad that we're trapped aboard the Anastasia!</strong>"   </p>
<p>The man looked angrily at me as he listened, but at least he didn't seem to understand my English too well to understand what I was doing.  "This is an ad for foot cream!"</p>
<p>"Do they not have advertisements in Brazil?" I scoffed nervously, showing no sign of weakness, "They will announce it in a few minutes."</p>
<p>I knew that it was a long-shot but it seemed to be working - one by one, the sailors crowded around the radio as the advertisements blared through the small cabin.  None of them seemed to notice the approaching motors and eventually footsteps on the boat several minutes later as they were absorbed in the announcement that would never come.</p>
<p>The door burst open as the sailors dropped their weapons in surprise.  Several armed men pointed their automatics at them and yelled in Portuguese.  The sailors quickly surrendered as many things were being yelled.  I mean, I couldn't understand any of it but just imagine one of those international Netflix movies, and try to imagine the subs.  Only the whole situation didn't have any subtitles.</p>
<p>After the sailors had been taken away, the rest of the passengers got up and looked at me.   There were several murmurs of thanks as I looked at the woman earlier who had consistently harassed me.</p>
<p>"I-I'm sorry," she looked down at the ground, "That's all you'll get from me."</p>
<p><em>Is she serious?</em></p>
<p>"Hold out your hand."  I smiled at her.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Hold out your hand."  I kept my intentions unknown.</p>
<p>The woman nervously held out her hand together and looked at me.  Before she could react, I took a string from my sleeve and tied her wrists in a tight knot that was nearly impossible to untie.   It was tight enough that it dug into her skin, so any scissors would be extremely painful to cut the wire.</p>
<p>"What the fuck!"  she exclaimed as she glared at me, "What was that for?"</p>
<p>"That was another 'useless' job I had," I shrugged, "I had to tie knots for a part-time when I was a teenager!"</p>

<p>June was born in August, making her a problem child from her very first minutes. Her mother used to say her very 
first words, after looking around the delivery room like a critic after an arthouse film, were: "Is this it?"</p>
<p>Which was probably not true, but still.</p>
<p>Things didn't get better when, at age nine, June's father sat her down on her bed and, behind a nicotine stained beard and a flask of whiskey he always carried with him, told her that he had made a very important discovery many years ago in his lab at UCLA.</p>
<p>"What discovery, Dad?" June had asked, a question she'd later regret like people regret pet snakes.</p>
<p>"Well, June, me and Victoria, my lab partner, we discovered this thing called the Multiverse. It means that there is 
an infinite number of universes existing at the same time, and we're just living in one of them. These universes can 
affect one another occasionally – like, people usually get sick here if a version of themselves die in another universe – but overall it's not a big deal. Well, except for the fact that it renders everything we ever knew about reality, 
existence and the importance of the self and ego useless, of course."</p>
<p>Her father left the room with a drunken smile that day. He killed himself a few years later, leaving June alone to 
deal with the fact that reality was not like everyone around her assumed. Which can mess with your head a bit, especially in teenage years.</p>
<p>And that's why June was a bit of a problem child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In school, June was something of a loner, as you'd expect from someone who knows a hidden horrible truth about the universe. She was also pretty good at Physics and surprisingly good at English, though terrible at Biology.</p>
<p>It was during a particularly boring biology class that she overheard Greg, part time quarterback, occasional idiot 
and full time crush of every stupid girl in school, talking to one of his friends from the football team in hushed 
whispers: "It's a virus, it seems," Greg was saying. "The disease is all over Europe, already. And South America. 
They don’t know what causes it, only that it makes people really, really dumb. They're calling it Keeping up with 
the Kardashians Syndrome, or KUK."</p>
<p>After the bell rang, June went by the boys without a second glance, wondering how exactly people would be able to tell if Greg had the Kuk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When June got home, she knew something was wrong immediately, and not just because Bill Purr, her cat, was 
trying to eat the ceramic apples on the coffee table – after all, Bill had always been a bit stupid.</p>
<p>No, what made June realize something was wrong was that her mother was also trying to eat the apples.</p>
<p>"Mom?" June tried, careful. Her mother looked up, the apple still hanging from between her teeth like a stuffed pig 
at a cartoon banquet. </p>
<p>"Yes, June?"</p>
<p>"You do know those are not real, right?" June asked.</p>
<p>Her mother looked down at the apple. Behind her, a newswoman on TV talked over a headline that read 'Kuk Virus 
Reaches California'.</p>
<p>"Oh, shit," June said, as Bill Purr threw himself at the wall and passed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you know about Kok!?" June asked, as soon as Greg opened the door to his house.</p>
<p>"Well, I think the American average is 6,2 inches, but girth is more important, some girls told –"</p>
<p>"The disease!" June walked in without being invited.</p>
<p>"Oh, you mean Kuk." Greg closed the front door and turned. "How did you find my address, by the way?"</p>
<p>"I called the school," June said. "The principal has been infected. I said I was doing an interview for the Kidnapper's 
Weekly Magazine and needed some addresses and she said OK."</p>
<p>"Shit…" Greg strolled to the couch and took a seat. "So it's really spreading…"</p>
<p>"Yeah, and I heard you talking about it before everyone else, so what's the deal?"</p>
<p>"What's it to you?" Greg asked, looking up.</p>
<p>June hesitated for two reasons: first, her father had told her never to tell anyone about the Multiverse and the fact 
that sick people on our reality meant people dying on other realities. It could cause panic. And second, because 
there was <em>no way</em> Greg Marshall would understand it even if she tried to explain.</p>
<p>"I'm… worried," June said. "My mom's infected."</p>
<p>"Yeah, so is my dad," Greg replied. From the upper floor, a male voice rang: <em>"Hey, where's my shoe?"</em></p>
<p>"So?" June insisted. "What do you know about it?"</p>
<p>Greg got up and headed towards her. "Ok, listen… my mom was a scientist, back when she was alive. I'm not smart 
like she was, so I don't really understand all of this. But she once told me something that stayed with me."</p>
<p>June waited, anxious.</p>
<p>"She gave me a… well, a sort of helmet. And she told me never to use it… unless if someday everyone but me start 
getting sick for no apparent reason. So I always follow disease news rather closely."</p>
<p>June frowned. "Greg…"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>From upstairs, a loud thud preceded Greg's father's voice: "Outch! When did wood become so solid!?"</p>
<p>"Did your mom work at UCLA?"</p>
<p>"Yeah…"</p>
<p>"Was her name Victoria?"</p>
<p>"Yeah…"</p>
<p>June looked down. Then up. "Yeah. I think I'm gonna have to see that helmet."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>From upstairs, a low rustle and crackling of fire reached them. Greg's father uttered "Woah! Fire burns curtains! Look at that!"</p>
<p>June took Greg's hand and looked up the nicest look she could; a look like she was interacting with a child who received very limited oxygenation during its early fetal period. "Because, Greg," she said, "I'm pretty sure that helmet will take us to another universe."</p>

<p>"What kind of stupid question is that? How the hell should I know what's in their freezer? Billionaires probably don't even eat Bagel Bites, you idiot."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but if I were a billionaire, I'd buy a <em>whole lot</em> of Bagel Bites."</p>
<p>"Marv, that's probably why you're not a billionaire. Now shut up, I think it's time to move. I haven't seen any movement since we got here and I know the owners are dead."</p>
<p>The Wet Bandits had parked their run-down Chevy Astro about half a mile away from the biggest, most luxurious house in the entire city and waited for night to fall before making their move.</p>
<p>"Can you believe they didn't even hire security to keep the place safe?" Harry asked, laughing. His gold tooth sparkled a little through the smile.</p>
<p>"Probably spent all the money on Bagel Bites."</p>
<p>"Ah, Jesus, shut up already. You take the back entrance, I'm gonna try and break through the front somehow. Lots of windows and doors."</p>
<p>The duo split, and Harry began to work on picking the front door's lock. Marv tip-toed around back to a stairwell that led up to a rear entrance. As he walked up to the door, a strange <em>click</em> came from the other side. When he tried to jimmy the doorknob, something surprised him- the door was unlocked. </p>
<p>"Wow, Harry! These guys are total morons! The back door was unlocked, come around!" he shouted to no avail. "Huh, probably can't hear me. Oh well, I'll just unlock the front door."</p>
<p>What he didn't know was that Harry <em>did</em> hear him, but was unable to respond because a military-grade taser had been rigged to fire when he stepped onto the doormat. Harry was convulsing on the ground, foaming slightly at the mouth, rigid as a board. </p>
<p>Marv quietly and carefully walked into the rear mudroom, then through a large hallway and toward the front entrance. It was very dark, and none of the light switches worked.</p>
<p>"Maybe they shut the power off to save energy? Man, if I was a billionaire..."</p>
<p>He was unable to finish his sentence because to his right, in the kitchen, a piping-hot platter of Bagel Bites was set up on the counter. They looked so fresh and delicious, the smell entered his nostrils and he shivered with delight. He walked toward them, completely disregarding the fact that cooked food indicated someone was home, salivating and laughing.</p>
<p>When he went to reach one, his hand passed through the plate. He swiped again and again, but his hand couldn't grab hold of anything. </p>
<p>"What the hell? Fake Bagel Bites? Is this a hologram?"</p>
<p>He stumbled forward, out of the kitchen, where an old lady was waiting for him.</p>
<p>"You will never have Bagel Bites again. If you do, I will kill you," the woman said ominously.</p>
<p>"G....grandma? But ..why? I love Bagel Bites...."</p>
<p>Immediately behind him, a tiny abomination appeared and shrieked like a banshee, leaving Marv crippled in fear and begging for his mother. He dropped to the floor, rocking back and forth, twitching and sobbing. The monster peeled it's mask off, revealing a gas mask underneath.</p>
<p>"Alfred, it's Wayne. Did the guy out front go down?" the little boy asked calmly, blanket draped over his shoulders like a cape.</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Wayne. Are you okay on your end?" the voice responded over a tiny intercomm.</p>
<p>"Yep, he's hallucinating like crazy. I can't believe that gas was so cheap yet incredibly effective."</p>
<p>"Nor I, Master Wayne. I will call the police immediately. Detective Gordon will have a laugh about this when he hears of it."</p>
<p>"Sure. Thanks for letting me mess with them a little, Alfred. I know you just wanted to call the cops but this was fun."</p>

<h1>[WP] A ghost and a zombie meet. They're from the same person.</h1>
<p>Score: 705</p>
<p>Eric shuffled along Main Street, brightly greeting the other zombies he passed along the way.</p>
<p>"Hey, guys! Apocalypse treating you well, I presume?"</p>
<p>They moaned back feebly, and Eric sighed to himself. They never got his jokes. Not surprising, of course. He was one of the few who had somehow maintained his intelligence after the infection spread, and the world had gone to shit.  It really was a curse, more than anything else. The only one like himself he'd found was a ten-year-old zombie child, who'd been beheaded by the Survivors before he could intervene. </p>
<p>"Eric? Eric," he heard a soft whisper rustle through the trees. </p>
<p>He shivered - such a human reaction. He looked around and saw the tell-tale translucent outline of a ghost leaning against a tree.</p>
<p>"Not in the mood, buddy," he muttered to it as he came closer. He couldn't make out any features except an enormous pair of eyes - milky orbs fixed on his face. "Move towards the light already, will you? God knows there's none of it on Earth anymore."</p>
<p>"Can't," it sighed the word. "I'm you, moron. We're split. And so we're incomplete, and I can't move on! Unfinished business, as they say. That's putting it mildly."</p>
<p>He stared at it, and understood. "You're <em>my</em> ghost? Bullshit. How can I still think and talk, then?"</p>
<p>"You can talk exactly because I'm a ghost!" </p>
<p>It drifted closer, shaking the vague shape that was its head. </p>
<p>"Listen to me, talking about <em>you</em>. It's why we're the way we are. Why I am. The infection didn't spread through you completely. And so we didn't die completely. Give up the remaining bit of your soul so we can move on, already! This plane is run by demons now. Assholes. They creep me out, I want to get away."</p>
<p>"And I don't?" Eric snapped to his ghost-self. If it even spoke the truth. "Zombies don't exactly make for stimulating company, let me tell you. Moaning and slurping up rotten meat, that pretty much sums them up. Go on, possess me or something. Get the last bit of ourself out."</p>
<p>"It doesn't work like that! No, you have to die again. Properly this time."</p>
<p>They bickered in the street, and Eric forgot where he was and where he'd been heading. He was still arguing when a Survivor crept up behind him with a machete, and took off his head with one clean swipe.</p>
<p>Eric's ghost stared at the head bouncing down the street with grim satisfaction. He'd seen the man coming, of course.</p>
<p>"Finally," he said, swooping after it. "Time to get this over and done with."</p>
<p>He possessed the head as it came to a standstill in a ditch. He had to move quickly to reunite with the last bit of his consciousness, which should be trying to escape from his old body right about now. He swooped into the head's bloody ear canal with a ghostly moan.</p>
<p>Eric's eyes flew open, and he took in a deep breath. Finally, heaven. He glanced around, but could only see concrete.</p>
<p>"Well, this can't be right," he told himself calmly, trying to take stock of his surroundings. </p>
<p>Was this hell, then? He peered upward, and saw the Earth's night sky glittering above. He sniffed carefully, and got a whiff of sewer water. A thrill of horror shot down his spi...no. Not his spine. He didn't have a spine. </p>
<p>"Shit," he whispered in panic. He was trapped in his head. </p>
<p>"Huuugnnghh," he heard something groan above him. The gaunt, maggot-eaten features of a zombie was just visible if he rolled his eyes up. </p>
<p>"No! No!" he screamed as it picked him up and stumbled down the street. "Hey, put me down!"</p>
<p>As it sniffed his head and moaned appreciatively, Eric sighed and closed his eyes. He waited for the inevitable moment when he'd become dinner. </p>
<p>"Hey buddy," the zombie suddenly whispered in his ear. "Sorry I reached you so late - and for pretending to be a real zombie. They're watching us. <em>They're everywhere</em>."</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes up and squinted, and finally recognised the zombie. No mistaking those tattoos, messed up and faded though they were.</p>
<p>"Zack?" he muttered, and groaned aloud. </p>
<p>How did that guy, of all people, keep a grip on his sanity? A friend of his college roommate, Zack had been just a <em>bit</em> hypervigilant. Many had informally diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic, though Zack had never been to see a therapist. </p>
<p>"Where are you taking me?" he demanded. </p>
<p>"A place only I know about," Zack hissed back. "I saw this coming <em>years</em> ago and prepared accordingly. And I think I know what to do about your little predicament. Removing and reattaching heads are a cakewalk, trust me."</p>
<p>Eric sighed as Zack babbled on. It wasn't as if things could get much worse. Hadn't he already been resigned to being eaten? What else could possibly happen?</p>
<p>"Alright, Zack. Head me in the right direction."</p>
<p>It took Zack a moment, but then he burst into hideous, hoarse peels of laughter.  </p>
<p>"Good one, man! I like your style. Keeping that sense of humour alive and kickin'. Good for you. Well, you'll need it when I administer your treatment. Boy, I can't wait! Good thing I trained for this all those years in college, huh? They never did catch me, you know. I was <em>that</em> good."</p>
<p>"Wait, what do you mean? What training? Caught you doing what, exactly?"</p>
<h2>He shouted in vain at Zack, as his former friend began humming to himself and showing no sign of hearing him.  Finally, he simply gave up and waited to see what would happen. Maybe he'd be lucky and die again as Zack 'treated' him. Third time's the charm, as the old saying went.</h2>

<p>"Any chance it'll be twins?" Maleficent mused.</p>

<p>"Here's a hint," Maleficient snapped. "If I kill you, there'll be one life force left. And it's looking tempting, brat, if I don't get the firstborn I was promised. <em>Gods</em>, what a waste of magic."</p>
<p>"I have a lawyer who owes me a favor," Faye said.</p>

<p>"Elle, Mother Maleficent is picking you up in five minutes; do you have everything?"</p>
<p>"<em>Yes</em>, Mama," the twelve-year-old said impatiently. "I told you twice already."</p>
<p>"When I picked you up, you forgot all of your dresses," Faye said, arching an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"That's because Mother was making a raven talk and I was distracted. I remembered right away when we were on the broom."</p>
<p>"<em>After</em> I took off."</p>
<p>Rapunzel--Elle--rolled her eyes. Faye was worried that this would become a habit, as she had heard from mothers of teenagers. Elle was vivacious and generally obedient, but she had seen her friends' children degenerate into sullen and insatiable slouches practically overnight.</p>
<p>Not that Elle was her daughter, Faye reminded herself.</p>
<p>"Mother Maleficent already knows you're grounded, so don't even think about trying it, young lady."</p>
<p>Elle glared. "I wasn't in danger."</p>
<p>"You could have been. Cognitive bias called outcome bias; don't use it. The fact that it turned out okay doesn't mean that hanging upside down from your broom wasn't a stupid and dangerous decision." Faye finished stirring the bubbling pale-blue cauldron. "Arm, please."</p>
<p>The girl huffed but extended her arm, and Faye carefully cut her palm until a few drops of blood fell out and into the potion. She mixed it in as Elle applied a dab of cream to her hand, the cut healing almost instantly into nonexistence.</p>
<p>Just then, Maleficent appeared in a billow of green smoke. "Ready to go, love?"</p>
<p>"Mal," Faye said, "you remember that thing we talked about earlier? I looked into them, and it's not a good idea."</p>
<p>Maleficient's nose wrinkled disdainfully. "I presumed as much. What kind of incompetent idiots were they, anyway."</p>
<p>"It's worse. There's another, a boy, maybe ten. He's--not doing well. None of them are."</p>
<p>"I have a brother?" Elle shrieked, and both witches jumped.</p>
<p>"Um," Faye said.</p>
<p>"Smooth, Faye." Maleficent turned to the shocked twelve-year-old. "Elle-girl, your mama and I need to discuss this some more, and we need to, um, <em>talk</em> with your biological parents before we go any further with this."</p>
<p>"Can we rescue him, Mama, can we, please, please?" Elle begged, ignoring Maleficent. "I can teach him how to make potions and fly on a broomstick and talk to cats! And they were mean, those people you made me see once, we can't just leave him there! He's already been there fore ten years!"</p>
<p>Faye sighed. "We'll talk about it, darling. Your mother and I are very aware of his situation, and we don't want to leave him there any more than you do."</p>
<p>"I'll be good forever, I promise," Elle said.</p>
<p>"No," Maleficent said sharply. When Elle's head snapped around, shocked, she added quickly, "You should always be good, but we're not going to leave your brother there just because you decided to trample the deadly nightshade in my garden. We're not going to put life-and-death decisions on your shoulders, Elle-girl. That's far too much weight for you right now."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mother," Elle said obediently, although it was obvious that she was just being agreeable in an attempt to win over the witches.</p>

"Joe?" the guy next to me, Bill, asked. "Is that you?"<br />

I thought back to that night, remembering the ordeals I had been through. However, my thoughts were interrupted when some guy in a blue puffy suit burst in.<br />
"Fair Maiden!" he yelled, and everyone turned to look, first at him and then at me. The laughing resumed. "I have come to claim your hand in marriage!" This was the fifth prince that had asked for my hand in marriage.

I punched him in the face. These princes weren't all that tough.<br />
The bartender brought out my beer, and I chugged it. Then I got up to leave. I didn't really care to hang around people much; the people who were okay with me were the ones I hated, and the people I put up with hated me. I walked out the door, being sure to stomp on the prince's face on my way out.<br />
There was only one good thing that I had found about the curse. I sang a heavy metal song, one of my favorites, and my ride walked up. Everyone in the bar watched as I rode away on a live grizzly bear.</p>

He pulled a washcloth from his jacket pocket and a bottle of water from a different one. He poured the water on the towel and began washing the man's feet. The homeless man didn't react, probably in a drug-induced haze, Thorn realized. "You aren't sidekicks in this phase. You're students."  </p>

<p>My listless corpse slammed to the ground in a bloody splatter, the tangled mess of vivified branches that had embraced me finally releasing its grasp and returning to the position it had held before I'd engaged it.</p>
<p>This was my seven-hundred-fifty-second attempt at this new half-life in Hell. All it seemed to consist of was this horrid array of nightmarish ghouls in a sprawling landscape of various forms; tree demons in a wooded thicket, hydra in a placid pond, draconic monsters atop castle battlements. It didn't really matter which direction I decided to push myself. Death rushed to meet me around nearly every corner.</p>
<p>The first time was alarming, I admit. Ascending a staircase in the decaying ruins of what might have been a church or a theater just after my condemnation, I had run into a half-man, half-goat behemoth that crushed me underfoot almost before I'd noticed it was there. I found myself wondering briefly, as my life-force ebbed, what happened when one died in what was supposed to be the punishment of the already-dead. It didn't take long to find out -- I just ended up alive again, back where I'd first awoken in this hellscape.</p>
<p>Every death, the same thing: finding myself reviving at whatever place I had most recently camped out. The fires I lit seemed to always beckon me back when I felt my vitality suddenly cease.</p>
<p>This Hell seemed hopeless.</p>
<p>That was, at least, until the Savior arrived.</p>
<p>His entrance to Hell was foretold by glowing white runes on the ground near one of these horrible beasts. I cautiously approached it, certain it was a trap, like some of the notes on the ground that read "Jump here" but only led to an infinite chasm. To my surprise, when I touched the sign, a burly tower of a man with an enormous shield and a six-foot sword slowly faded into existence in front of me. Startled, I fell backwards to the ground, barely catching myself before cracking my skull. I didn't know his intent, so I scuttled away awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, dude. I'm here to help. God sent me."</p>
<p>I shook my head, confused, as the man approached me. Expecting the worst, I grimaced in anticipation of the blade surely about to bisect me.</p>
<p>Instead, he reached out a hand to help me up. "The name is Havelbuster. I apparently died this week because I forgot to eat. Dark Souls III just came out and I was going HAM as fuck. I guess God figured you guys needed some help down here, so... here I am."</p>
<p>My dread subsiding, I explained to him the Lovecraftian creature residing behind the wall of fog just down the hall.</p>
<p>Havelbuster strode confidently down the steps and pushed his way through the pea soup. I followed, certainly not half as confidently, but managed not to curl in fright as the horrid eight-limbed abomination roared its challenge.</p>
<p>The armored warrior charged without hesitation, immediately beginning to hack away at one of the tentacles flailing toward him. Rolling to avoid another tentacle's graceless swipe, Havelbuster's sword traced an arc that cleanly lopped off a good portion of the sucker-covered arm.</p>
<p>At that point, unfortunately, things went sideways.</p>
<p>Feeling emboldened by my metal-clad savior, I threw myself into the fray as well, forgetting that I had absolutely no armor, no weapon, and no skill with which to go toe-to-toe with this hideous mountain of flesh. It only mattered for a moment, though, because I took a blow to the chest with a barbed tentacle tip that pierced directly through my heart on its way out through my spine.</p>
<p>Paralyzed, bleeding not quite profusely by only the grace of the barb embedded within me, I tried to call to the shieldbearer weakly, sure that my voice wouldn't carry. He must have heard, though, because he turned, sweeping his edge through another whiplike extremity, and sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"We will now be opening for questions," the gooey grey alien in the suit said, turning to the audience.</p>
<p>Behind him, Mark Wilson smiled. He risked a glance at himself in the mirror in the back of the conference room – his silhouette against the white light of the power point presentation onscreen behind him was lean and tall, like a very successful turkey breast roll. He pointed at an alien with its hands up on the front row.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wilson, could you repeat the part about the gravity and the space travel? I mean, I understand you guys 
conquered your own moon, but how!?"</p>
<p>Mark smiled at the alien. A very faint roar reached his ears from up above, but he ignored it for the time being. 
"Like I said, the biggest part of it is getting the ship out of the atmosphere. We burn fuel to do that, so we can –"</p>
<p>"Fuel?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's dinosaur juice that's been sitting under the Earth for millions of years."</p>
<p>The aliens exchanged impressed looks. "What about breathing in space?"</p>
<p>"Well, unlike most species in the galaxy, earthlings can only survive inside the atmosphere of their own planet. So 
we had to develop a suit that could maintain pressure and oxygen levels stable in our bodies."</p>
<p>Another murmur ran through the room. Mark held on to his smile.</p>
<p>The roaring sound grew louder, but still Mark ignored it. <em>Not yet.</em></p>
<p>Everything amazed the aliens. It was so easy. He had given motivational speeches on Earth before, but damn if interspace motivation wasn't so much better. You could do an hour on not giving up on your dreams using the invention of the toaster oven as a central theme. The first pizza and the importance of indulgence. Roller blades and how acknowledging the futility of life can lead to a better you.</p>
<p>Really. The aliens didn't have gravity. Or atmosphere. Or wars. Or pretty much anything to deal with. They conquered space travel the day they learned how to jump. Their bodies didn't need food or sunlight or water to survive.</p>
<p>Those guys… the space equivalent of spoiled little brats. Eager to learn as much as they could about the burden of 
mankind – or, in other words:</p>
<p>"How the hell did you guys find time and energy to accomplish so much?"</p>
<p>"Well," Mark said, pacing from one side of the stage to another. "We set goals and we work towards them."</p>
<p>"Goals?"</p>
<p>"Yes, like landing on the moon. Curing smallpox. Ending world hunger."</p>
<p>More hands shot to the air. Mark pointed at one at random. "And what are mankind's plans for the future?"</p>
<p>The roaring was now loud enough that few could keep ignoring it. Half the aliens had their heads still turned to 
Mark, half were looking around searching for the source.</p>
<p>"Well, that's the funny thing," Mark said, stopping at the center of the stage. "You guys never had to develop any 
technology. You didn't need energy or food, so you never learned to hunt or to build dams. You don't have 
predators, so why build shelter? You don't even have gravity, so you never bothered to develop any kind of sophisticated interstellar transportation. You just sort of live here in your little planet, rent free, no trouble. A utopia of happiness."</p>
<p>The aliens nodded in agreement, more and more looking around for the source of the roaring sound.</p>
<p>"Well… we're humans," Mark continued. "We're the scum of the universe. But don't blame it on us – we've been 
dealt a shitty hand. So, to make up for it, we've developed all this technology you guys just amazed yourselves with…"</p>
<p>The ceiling blew away, revealing the ships hovering menacingly over the aliens' heads. Bright lights flooded the room, and the faces of human soldiers emerged from black holes in the base of the ships.</p>
<p>"… and now we're using that technology to bomb your planet back to the Stone Age, which technically you never 
left," Mark finished. "So we can steal <em>your</em> dinosaur juice."</p>
<p>The aliens all exchanged looks, confused. Scared. Mark signaled for the ships to fire.</p>
<p>"We're humans," Mark said, as the laser beam shot down from the mother ship. "And we're bad as shit."</p>

<p>Hours passed until he heard the distinct "DING" from his email received notification.</p>

New email titled: "Would you like to change the difficulty? Current Setting: Very Hard"</p>
<p>Connor stared at his screen...and clicked into the email.
The body read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hello Connor08011996,</p>
<p>I have noticed that you are having a very rough time working with the difficulty settings that your parents set for &gt;you at birth.  Not everyone gets to use console for the setup of their child and Very Hard is not a setting that is &gt;recommended unless they start off with a LOT of help; help you did not get.</p>
<p>Now...I'm not admitting any liability/fault here, but I'm offering you several options to make your experience in &gt;the beta a little more enjoyable.</p>
<p>You may only choose ONE of the following options: When you use one, the others will deactivate.
Before you fall asleep, think of the time that you stole that toy at Mr. O'Flanahan's toy store when your family &gt;went to Niagara Falls.  Specifically think of how you told your mother that "it was a gift from the owner for being &gt;such a good boy".
You will be prompted for which option:</p>
<p>1.) Console (Cheat Engine) -  Say "Cheater"</p>
<p>You'll fall asleep and go into settings.  Now I've preconfigured access so that you can get THREE uses of console, &gt;so make good use of each session.</p>
<p>Onto the cheats.
You'll be able to give yourself more money (up to $250,000 USD each session), alter your appearance, take a &gt;boost to your stats (I've given you 50 points that you can distribute), change your relationship stats with others &gt;(once per session), and save/load your progress (Only 1 save/load per session).</p>
<p>Normally, you get no achievements for using this...but I'll let it slide for you.  </p>
<p>2.) Difficulty Change: Say "Difficulty Change"
You will appear in a room with Six different blocks.
1 through 6.  </p>
<p>1 represents VERY EASY</p>
<p>2 represents EASY</p>
<p>3 represents NORMAL (Default)</p>
<p>4 represents HARD (All tasks +100% difficulty)</p>
<p>5 represents VERY HARD (All tasks +300% difficulty)</p>
<p>6 represents DEBUG (All tasks effectively impossible, please do not choose)</p>
<p>Choose your new difficulty by punching through the block of your choice.<br />
You will wake up, and resume.  No penalty for doing this...thought you will not get any of the possible rewards for &gt;completing your existing quests.</p>
<p>3.) Restart: Say "Restart"
Nothing fancy here, you get a complete redo.<br />
Same difficulty, but you will have retain all knowledge up to this decision.
You regain all skills at the age of 5...so you will have a few years where you get to relearn motor skills and things &gt;like using your vocal chords.  </p>
<p>Hope this helps.
I'm cheering for you kid.</p>
<p>Yours Truly,
JC (Creator, Admin)"</p>

<p>A man, a strange <em>man</em> tells Richard to stop breaking the fourth wall like he is on TV. It makes for an unbelievable story that breaks a reader's suspension of disbelief.  </p>
<p>"What suspension of disbelief," Richard asks no one in particular. "It's a fantasy for Christ's sake."  </p>
<p>The adventurer mumbles to himself while making his way through the woods. Soon, Richard begins to realize the error in his ways, and resumes his search for the Dragon's key.  </p>
<p>"No."  </p>
<p>It's the story, Richard. Just go with it.  </p>
<p>"I refuse."  </p>
<p>Don't be difficult, we have a plot to get back on. Richard pushes a branch out of the way---  </p>

<p>Stop that, this is supposed to be a kid's story!  </p>
<p>"Fuck you, I want out."  </p>
<p>Richard pleaded to the silent woods for mercy, but only the leaves rustling in the wind responded to his desperate cry. The weight of this quest sat heavily in his chest, with no companion to share this burden with.  </p>
<p>"You killed him off in the second chapter."  </p>
<p>The adventurer sat on a fallen tree, bemoaning---  </p>
<p>"Yuck, it's got moss all over it."  </p>

<p>Richard <em>stood</em>, with resolve in his heart, to finish this quest.  </p>

<p>"No, I'm getting a drink." But Richard wasn't serious.  </p>

<p>Little did Richard remember of the previous two books, of his many heroic deeds and noble tasks, which catered to his audience, who's age happened to range from <em>10 to 14!</em>  </p>

<p>Too late, an endless wood ventured out to impossible distances in every direction the adventurer could see. Sorry.  </p>

<p>Two men sat in the tavern of Telver Town enjoying two pints of non-alcoholic beverages, preparing to continue their journey.  </p>
<p>"So then," the first man said. "I scaled up the cliff for two days, with nothing but a piece of string and a backpack to sustain me!"    </p>
<p>Richard did not reply to Frederick the Lesser's boasting. Instead, he took another sip, smiling at the stories Fred shared of his impossible survival that led to their reunion. </p>

These skills are what make you our greatest assets, but also our greatest weaknesses. You know our secrets, know our plans, and you know who our other agents are. You have of course been trained to resist torture, but these Hedonians utilise something worse than you can imagine.”</p>
<p>“Worse than Algosian thumb-screws?” asked one burly lad from the back of the room.</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>“Worse than an Ouduni nipple clamp?” asked a femme-fatal in the front row.</p>
<p>“Without a doubt,” I nodded grimly. “These people… well let me give you a demonstration. Any volunteers?”</p>
<p>The room was silent as the students looked around at each other. They had all experienced various forms of torture in their training, but that didn’t mean they wanted to go through any more. Finally the man built like a brick wall from the back of the room stood up.</p>
<p>“I will, I can take anything,” he spoke. They were always so sure.</p>
<p>“Very well, come up to the front,” the man came to the front. “Please take a seat.”
The man sat down in the chair, pointed away from me and facing the rest of his comrades. I slowly placed my hands on the man’s neck, my fingers hard as leather began to slightly squeeze. I moved down to his shoulders and began to give him a thorough massage.</p>
<p>“Massage is only one of the tricks these Hedonians use to get information from our agents,” I said, as I moved down to his lower back.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Is this it?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not as well trained as a Hedonian masseuse, but I think I can get something out of you.” I spoke, squeezing the knots out of his back.</p>
<p>“It’s just a massage guys, this is nothing,” he said to his comrades, a hint of humour in his voice.</p>
<p>“But doesn’t it feel good?”</p>
<p>“Well yeah, but…”</p>
<p>“Shh, don’t talk. Just relax,” I said and began working his spine. It was like hypnotism, you had to get them into the right pleasured state of mind.</p>
<p>“So, I hear the Ekklesian fleet is sending a force of twenty triremes to Hedonia this campaigning season.” I said. Gossip was a key interrogation technique for the Hedonians.</p>
<p>“No, that’s just a distraction tactic. We plan on invading the Aogan Isles in the Summer,” the man spoke freely, mystified by my massage.</p>

<p>Tim looked surprised. "I am sure this is a distraction to our quest" he said, as he stuffed a handful of cheetos into his mouth, "but if you are both insistent..."</p>

<p>"Oh come on, that was funny!" Hans complains, before teleporting to the kitchen to get himself breakfast. Sighing, I crawl out of bed and slump to the floor, staring longingly at the door. I hear Hans turn on the TV to a random news channel, which is probably describing his latest exploits. The Wily Warper! Not even a good superhero name.</p>
<p>By the time I've got myself breakfast and sat down in the living room, Hans has started his "exercises". Basically, he's jumping around the room, occasionally poking me, to hone his teleportation skills. Meanwhile, the TV is still describing how he managed to save over a hundred people from a collapsing building while Wormface, another of the city's superheroes, hunted down the perpetrators. Thankfully, despite having several superheroes, the city's never had a supervillain. </p>
<p>The media say that that's because Wormface, the Wily Warper, Laura the Destrauya, and Superbman scare them off, mentioning that one time a supervillain tried to come but had his tank blown up before he got here. I disagree. Which is, among my friends an unpopular opinion to have. You see, not only do I live with the Wily Warper, I also study the same course as Wormface, know Laura the Destrauya from school, and became friends with Superbman after I stopped him getting run over. Superbman's never been the best at understanding traffic.</p>
<p>So when my friends aren't mocking me for not having any powers, they'll keep asking why I'm such a conspiracy theorist with all my cooky theories for why supervillains don't come. I really shouldn't have ever started telling them that's what I thought, or I could have just agreed with everyone else. But I'm stubborn, you know? Surprisingly stubborn.</p>
<p>I'm brought out of my moody thoughts by a change in the news, the bank's being robbed by some idiots with guns. Like, seriously, there are superheroes in this city. Anyway, Joel immediately starts putting on his suit. Likewise, I put on my hoodie. As he prepares to teleport I walk over to him and touch his elbow, bringing me with him as he appears outside the bank.</p>
<p>A crowd is pushing out of the bank, there are gunshots, I pretend to be a scared civilian and get ready for something even more exhausting than last night. Didn't need direct control that time.</p>
<p><em>I should probably just teleport in there and start punching people,</em> Hans thinks to himself. The idiot. <em>Or, or maybe I could teleport over to Superbman and get him to do the punching.</em> That's better, but still not good enough. I checked, and the people in the bank have three trained gunmen.</p>
<p><strong>PUNCH!</strong> Superbman thinks, or maybe he screams, hard to tell at this point, as he sprints into the bank. <em>Must get more help,</em> Hans decides, swiftly teleporting off to Laura and Wormface and bringing them into the back of the bank. </p>
<p><em>I'll drop each one off behind one of those scarier looking gunmen.</em></p>
<p><strong>PUNCH!</strong></p>

I looked towards her face which was bruised, red, and raw, but smiling wide. </p>
<p>"Baby!" She ousted, through a happily, choked-up voice. 
I couldn't say anything, so I smiled. 
"Now," started the nurse, "I'll leave you two alone. But remember, she's had quite the head injury so be careful, no excessive movements."</p>
<p>With the nurse now gone, I dreaded this confrontation and began to feel anxious. </p>
<p>"I was so scared, Justin," she said, "thank God you're here!" She opened her arms up and I reluctantly hugged her. Despite smelling like like a retirement home, I still caught whiff of her scent.</p>
<p>I had always smelled this particular scent when we'd spoon. It was strong in her hair and I used to nuzzle my face right up into it and kiss her on the back of the head. </p>
<p>After her arms let me go, she grasped my hand with hers and squeezed it tightly. I squeezed back. </p>
<p>"When I woke up, all I could think of was last week when we went to the pier and what you had said to me... I was in awful pain and demanded that they'd call you immediately."</p>
<p>The pier had been two years ago. We went on a Sunday morning, hoping the crowd would be smaller at the end of the weekend. We were wrong. The weather was perfect: the sun warmed everything it touched with only a few clouds above, all of which were seemingly only there to complement the blue sky. The place was packed so we decided to explore the beach beneath the pier. </p>
<p>Another nurse came into the room and spoke up, "just checking her vitals real quick." And she did as such. I sat there silently holding Rebecca's hand, staring directly into her eyes. The nurse, after a few minutes, left. Again, in that same, happy, choked-up voice, she said, "I'm so happy you're here right now. I can't believe I almost died today... You must have been so worried."</p>
<p>"I... I was," I said, almost as choked-up as her. 
"I promise you I'll be more careful driving from now on..." tears filled her eyes.
"It's okay, sweetie," I said, leaning over the bed to give her another hug. She wrapped her arms around me more tightly than she had ever before - amazing strength for someone who had been in an accident only a few hours ago.
"I love you, Justin. I always will. Forever." She squeezed even tighter. </p>
<p>That day under the pier, I sat up in the sand with Rebecca wrapped in my arms. We had been there for hours talking and watching the waves continuously blanket the sand and then retreat back into the sea. The sun, now bright orange, began disappearing behind the blue horizon. "I never want this to end," I said. 
"Me neither," she replied, "this sunset is perfect." 
"Well, that AND you, but I think you've got it beat." 
She turned around and kissed me as the sun finally vanished entirely, leaving only a red streak upon the sky.</p>
<p>"Rebecca," I looked into her eyes.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" </p>
<h2>"I love you. I always will. Forever."</h2>

<p>The news droned in the background as I looked at Elizabeth, who didn't seem to be phased by the whole thing.  </p>
<p>"You know, honey," she pointed towards the screen, "I think I might know that lady."</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, she used to bring cats to my vet all the time," she muttered and thought for a moment, "Yeah, that has to be her..."  Her voiced wandered off as our dog skipped into the living room, his tongue hanging out of his mouth.  He gave me a cheeky smile as I signaled for him to sit on my lap.</p>
<p>"Good boy, Odie!" I laughed as he jumped onto me and began to lick my face, "Calm down, I'll get your dinner soon!"</p>
<p>"Speaking of dinner, Jon," Liz suddenly looked alert, "Where's the cat?"</p>
<p>"Oh, him?"  I laughed as Odie jumped back onto the floor and started to chase his tail, "I'm sure he's fine."</p>
<p>"You should know where he is," Liz pointed out, "With everything that's been happening... you never know if he's turned into... into one of <em>them</em>."</p>
<p>"He's a lazy cat," I reassured as I wrapped my arm around her, "He's probably sleeping somewhere around the house."</p>
<p>"If you say so."  She didn't look entirely convinced.  </p>
<p>My stomach grumbled moments later as Liz laughed at me.  I blushed cheekily and pointed towards the kitchen.  "Don't get up," I smiled, "There's some leftover lasagna in the fridge.  I'll just reheat it." </p>
<p>"We had lasagna?"  she looked surprised but went back to the news, "Do whatever you want, Jon."</p>
<p>I chuckled nervously as I headed into the kitchen.  Odie was now sitting next to Liz as both of them seemed glued to the television.  I opened the fridge door as a cool blast of air hit my face.  I took a deep breath as I grabbed the plate of lasagna  and slowly walked out the kitchen door.  My backward was a mess, perhaps as a result of the dragons that had been flying around everywhere.  I carefully stepped through the leaves as I approached the tool shed.  I had built it myself for protection against the dragons, but recently it had served another purpose.  As I stood in front of the door, the sign glaring at me: </p>
<p><strong>Jon Arbuckle's Shed!  DO NOT ENTER!</strong>.</p>
<p>Liz had never entered it for she found no need to.  I quietly knocked on the door and creaked open the door.  "Hey, you in there?" I called, "I brought you lasagna..."</p>
<p>The door slammed shut behind me as a giant mass of orange with black stripes greeted me.  Through his scales and spines on his back, he opened in mouth in hunger, drool slowly dripping onto the floor.  He straightened to full height as I looked up at what was my former feline companion.  The dragon's head hit the ceiling and shook the shed, knocking me to the ground.</p>
<p>"Garfield, I swear to God!" I hissed as I picked myself up, "You're going to get caught!"</p>
<p>I tossed him the plate.  The dragon slowly sniffed the plate and swallowed it in a second. </p>
<p>"Cat or not," I took the plate, "Nothing's changed about you, Garfield." </p>
<p>"Actually, Mondays aren't so bad anymore Jon," he shrugged his wings at me.</p>
<p>I paid him no attention as I walked out of the shed.</p>

"You're kidding. Just for a favor this small?"<br />
"Bud, don't bullshit me. You came to me because you can't do the favor yourself."  <br />
"That's not why I---"<br />
"<em>And</em> because it can't be passed down any further. I'm the one on the end of the chain aren't I?"<br />

"Yes."  <br />
"$600. Pay up, or do it yourself."<br />
"Damnit, fine, here! You take card right?"<br />
"Yeah. Slide it there. Good, the payment's been accepted. Now tell me, what's the favor?"  </p>
<hr />
<p>It's always the same with the small-time volunteers. They take more than they can chew. The favor chokes on them like a bad meal. A sticky glob. Can't sink their teeth deep enough to break the favors down into small, manageable sizes. The newer volunteers get too greedy for their own good.  </p>
<p>So they come to me. And I always charge interest.  </p>
<p>Never easy getting a favor off your back. Can't just, reimburse someone and give it back to them. Favors don't work like coupons. Someone asks you to do something, you either do it or pay for a volunteer's services. The bigger the favor, the more times it can travel down the chain.

<p>You see, I'm special. The weight of a favor never begins to crush on me as a deadline comes. And when it comes, I'm already prepared. Understand that a person of my position is never asked to <em>complete</em> the favor. The small-time volunteers, the fresh faces, the overworked ones who have a favor they forgot about... they just want it gone.  </p>
<p>So they come to me.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Sophia,</p>
<p>Sorry Frederick was unable to drive you out to Seattle for Mother's day like you asked him. He already bought a ticket to Florida to see his own, so he asked a volunteer, who asked a volunteer, who asked a volunteer, who approached me to do this favor for you.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've also bought a ticket to see my mother that day, who lives in Arkansas on her lonesome. Maybe you should have planned out your weekend. I'd reevaluate how you go about setting aside time for your parents and making the commitment to set plans yourself that don't rely on a man abandoning their mother on Mother's day.  </p>
<p>Sincerely,  </p>

<p>Such is my craft.  </p>
<p>There are few of me, and many of them. Most would break under the favor and do <em>everything</em> to finish it. But again, people don't come to me to see the favor done. They just want it off their backs. So I always charge interest.</p>
<p>I am an expert of the evasion. An artisan of the alibi. The weight of a favor can only slide off a person under a <em>very</em> particular path. A path that takes a unique set of skills to create under a short amount of time.   </p>

<p>"Chriiiiis!" Dillon bellowed. I entered the living room to see the blonde moron in his Power Guy uniform, lifting the coffee table, sofa and plasma screen TV. 
"What?" I asked, annoyed. I'd spent all night working on my lesson plan for my first day teaching at Key Academy and had little time for his bullshit. Everyone in Altion City knew Power Guy, and how could they not? With super strength, laser vision, flight and invincibility to almost everything, Dillon was their idol; voted second most powerful superhero. In college he'd often take a rain check and fly off to fight some monster from space or a giant mole creature, while I took his notes for him. Now, I was the only one getting a job, while Super Idiot did jack shit. Now, he was going to wreck <em>my</em> stuff, stuff that I'd paid for, all for some joke. </p>
<p>"Bro, Centaurette is hosting this party tonight at Nighthawk's mansion, you want to-" Dillon began before his stack of furniture began to fall. I sighed, imagining the flow of time to slow, first to a crawl and then to a complete stop. Everything froze in place while I moved the furniture back to the way they were before Dillon messed with them. As usual, they drifted through the air like balloons when I moved them. I sighed and restarted time, the familiar light blue filter fading back to normal color as time started up again.   </p>
<p>"-go?" Dillon finished, blinking. "Where'd my lifting stack go?" I took a weary sip of my coffee and shrugged. 
"I dunno, maybe a speedster got to it. Anyway, I'm not going, job starts on Monday." i said, turning to head back into my room. Dillon nodded and put on his domino mask before heading to the window. 
"Suit yourself my unpowered companion!" he crowed before rocketing off into the sky. I watched him go before heading back to my room to resume working. The thing about being the first most powerful superhero on Earth is having a good cover. And being the Unpowered roomie of the second most powerful metahuman on Earth is a perfect cover. No special name, no costume, just a man. And I like it that way. </p>

<p>El sucked at the lip of an empty Corona, studying her reflection in the sun-bright screen. </p>
<p>No makeup. Too-fat mouth. Short hair still manic from the pillow where she'd sheltered, feigning sleep, while Jackie texted with her ex. She'd considered calling her out, raising hell, hurling invective and glassware until the girl fled, but even a cheating partner was better than nothing. She'd let the tryst continue.</p>
<p>Her focus flickered back to the email. </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty level?</strong></p>
<p>The sender field was blank, as usual. Whoever kept sending these, week after week, must have scheduled them out for months in advance. She moved it to the Spam folder, only to see another message take its place.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty level?</strong></p>
<p>El shook the Corona. Nothing left. She could see the empty fridge in her mind. Nothing but condiments and molding bread and Jackie's homemade (putrid) sun tea. She tilted the bottle back and felt the last drop flatten, warm, on her tongue. </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty level?</strong></p>
<p>Home row. Index on 'J.' Her fingertips hovered. Hammered. Replied.</p>

<p>She might not have beer or love or work or hope, but her snark was intact. That was something. Right?</p>
<p>A new, bolded subject line. </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty level? This will not affect your achievements.</strong></p>
<p><em>Sure. Let's change it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Please choose a new difficulty level.</strong></p>
<p><em>What are my options?</em></p>
<p><strong>Current setting: very hard. Options: easy, average, hard, very hard, impossible</strong></p>
<p>El considered. </p>
<p>"Easy" could mean a lot of things. A story mode game with a heart-breaking narrative. An uninterrupted foray into fantasy. But it could also mean slogging through worlds robbed of challenge. A smothering softness. Life with no edge.</p>
<p>She looked toward the bed, at the rumple of sheets on Jackie's side, at the bottle of Corona sitting empty, at the contortion of lime collapsed in its neck, at the credit card statements that fanned from the table. Would an easier life be better? Would less stress mean more happiness?</p>
<p><em>What would you choose?</em></p>
<p>The inbox sat quiet.</p>
<p>El sighed, stood. Hooked the neck of the bottle between her fingers and walked it back to the kitchen sink. The recycling was full, piled high with useless catalogs. Beneath the first two: a ticket stub. Something artsy. A date. Jackie-- overconfident--barely even trying to hide the affair. </p>
<p>The inbox pinged.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty level?</strong></p>
<p>She took the recycling to the curb. Made the bed. Stacked the bills.</p>
<p>Tomorrow--Sunday--she'd ask Jackie to leave. She had unemployment coming. Enough, maybe, to make the rent on her own. And if not, there were other rentals. Other women. Other ways.</p>

<p>As I spun the little wheel on my locker, the entire hallway shook. For just a moment, I was worried: was that me? I'd gotten pretty good about controlling my strength, but I still had the occasional accident. Other students glanced around, no doubt also wondering what it was. Maybe an earthquake? Then a ferocious howl echoed through the school, and I heard the distant sound of a wall crumbling. It was <em>Banshee</em>. </p>
<p>Next to me, my friend Matt paused with his biology book still in his hand. His eyes were wide with fright. <em>I</em> could easily take down the Banshee, but I was no ordinary student like him. Secretly, I was also Rex, superpowered guardian of the city. I just needed somewhere I could put on the mask and take off my clothes in privacy. </p>
<p>"I have to go to the bathroom!" I shouted.... just as Matt shouted the exact same thing. Damn! Of all times, why would he need to go <em>now</em>? He should be running! Another howl echoed through the hall, and the other students began to flee in all directions. Some were stupidly running <em>toward</em> the noise. Just more people I'd have to save.</p>
<p>"Ok... I'll just go to the one upstairs." I couldn't go to the same one as Matt; he'd see me change. Before he could say another word (or question why I wouldn't go use the one right around the corner) I dashed down the staircase to the third floor bathrooms. </p>
<p>"Oh, come <em>on</em>!" There was already a line of seven or eight other students waiting in front of the door, each one stamping their foot impatiently and casting worried glances. Outside, I could hear the Banshee's roars and the sounds of more walls coming down. I didn't have time for this crap! Why does the whole school suddenly need to take a leak?</p>
<p>Instead, I bolted to the nearest classroom. It was lunch, so it would be empty, right? Locked, but empty. I twisted the doorknob, applying just enough strength to shatter the lock into pieces. </p>
<p>"HEY!" Before I could even open the door all the way, I caught a glimpse of someone else inside, half-naked and wearing a pretty convincing replica of The Crusader's mask. What the hell? This person should be evacuating the building, not stripping down in the classroom and pretending to be a superhero. I needed this room, damn it! What is wrong with this school??</p>
<p>Fuck it. With a quick glance around to make sure no one was watching, I broke through the wall and went flying through the hole outside, putting on my mask amidst the rubble and dust. Just as swiftly, I tore off my backpack and clothes revealing my costume underneath. All of my stuff rained down onto the patch of grass below, along with most of the wall. It would be a bit hard to explain how everything got there, but I'd worry about that <em>after</em> Banshee was defeated. </p>
<p>I swooped over the buildings and into the school courtyard... only to find Banshee on the ground already. I counted <em>twenty three</em> of the city's heroes there already. There was Ms. Marvelous, standing between Capt. Lightning and Argonaut. <em>How the hell had they responded so quickly??</em> Before I even landed on the pavement next to them, four more heroes came running into the courtyard. </p>
<p>By the time the police arrived to haul the Banshee off, there were fifty two of us just sitting around chatting, with more arriving every minute. I made the rounds, shook hands, then took off to find all of my clothes and everything still in the bushes in front of the school. Before anyone knew what had happened, I was right back at my locker.</p>
<p>"You hear about the Banshee?" Matt asked from behind me.</p>
<p>I nodded. "Yeah... I, uh... saw the cops carrying him away. Crazy, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Matt responded. "And the weird thing: some of the other heroes... err, other <em>students</em>, I mean, were saying that he was trying to get the school's <em>mascot</em>!"</p>
<p>"Weird." I gave a laugh. "You think those assholes over at Kennedy High put him up to it?" Referring, of course, to our rival school. Homecoming was just a few weeks away, and they're really the only ones with the motive to go after our mascot.</p>
<p>"Ha, maybe." Matt went to open his own locker.</p>
<p>"Hey, maybe Banshee's a <em>student</em> there!" I joked. "They are pretty evil, after all!"</p>
<h2>Matt was silent; he suddenly seemed troubled. "No... that's... that's crazy. Couldn't be."</h2>

<p>“We do not count the individuals. We are all one.” Another unsatisfying answer for the humans but that is what they get for applying their logic to my species. They had been asking questions non-stop since I had arrived. It has been best to communicate through their electronics since a casual look at their history has shown them to be violent and unpredictable. </p>
<p>“But how do you have competing…” The humans question had been cut short. The crowd inside the transmission station had pushed him away. I had informed them they may ask any question but I would not answer them all. At first they simply shouted their questions over one another. They broadcast videos, radio, screamed into phone lines, spammed message boards. Anything to get their questions in electronic form hoping their question would be next.</p>
<p>“Do crabs think fish can fly?” The high pitched voice of the next human rang out in the nearly hollow space craft. </p>
<p>“No, crabs do not possess the capacity for abstract thinking.”</p>
<p>“Do any other species have abstract thinking?”</p>
<p>This human was lucky, she actually got a second question in. “None that are currently alive.” The human was ushered off stage as the answer rang out. Each person was allowed twenty seconds ask their question, a system that was put in place after the first month of chaos. The line of people waiting their turn was months long at this point. </p>
<p>“Does god have a plan for me?” Said a small voice. I gazed back at the video feed of the human asking this question, a young woman wearing a small gold cross.
“I cannot answer that.” No questions about the creator, that was the one rule. It did not stop them from trying. </p>
<p>An old man with thin rimmed glasses was next up. “Is it possible to travel faster than the speed of light?” I enjoyed the questions from the scientific community the most. They received the most thorough answers.</p>
<p>“You cannot move faster than light, but you may arrive at a location is less time than it takes light to travel there.” </p>
<p>“So worm hole travel is real?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>A small boy, no more than twelve year old stepped up next. I despised children and their asinine questions but if this is how the human wanted to waste my time then so be it. </p>
<p>“A-are you the smartest b-being?” He squeaked, stammering out his question. 
“No” I leaned back and stared at the metallic roof of my craft. </p>
<p>“So could you make a math problem so hard that you could not solve it?”
That question sounded vaguely familiar. “I could not”</p>
<p>“But it is possible then?” I looked back toward the video feed. Why was he not being moved along, surely he was over his time limit. </p>
<p>“Yes it is possible”</p>
<p>“If no other creatures have abstract thought and you are smarter than humans then that implies that there is another being in this universe that is smarter than you.” He said with more confidence in his voice. </p>
<p>Why wasn’t the crowd stopping this boy? </p>
<p>“So then you’re implying that there is something greater than you. Something you would not consider alive in the typical sense. There is a creator.”</p>
<p>“I cannot answer that.”</p>

<p>I was fourteen months old when my parents realised I was different. It was bath time, and I wanted no part of it. They lowered me into the tub, kicking and screaming, and the water parted like Moses and the sea. At least, that's what I've heard in the countless renditions of the tale.</p>
<p>Being born with an innate ability to control liquids meant I never had to hold a mug or carry an umbrella, as long as I was in the company of my family. You see, I was taught to keep my gift a secret before I could walk. "People just wouldn't understand", I was often told. Posters of super heroes adorned my bedroom walls, their action figures crowded my shelves. I would lie in bed and look up at them at night, eagerly anticipating the day I could join them in their ranks.</p>
<p>I attended a normal public school like every other child, but when my friends were heading off to college I was secretly enrolled into a school for 'gifted individuals'. It was there where they taught me to truly hone my gift. Finally allowed to embrace my power, I would spend hours practicing, sculpting water into fantastic shapes for my peers. I slowly grew stronger, more skilled. What were once rain drops and puddles were now ponds and swimming pools.</p>
<p>It was all over sooner than I liked. The time suddenly came for me to graduate and assume the role of side kick for an already established hero. I shouldered and elbowed my way to the front of a crowd of excited graduates that had gathered around a notice on the wall. I quickly scanned the list for my name. Disappointment hit me like a ton of bricks. "Seriously? <em>Him</em>? Of all the heroes, I get <em>the fucking weasel</em>?", I moaned out loud. </p>
<p>"Hey, maybe you can help him with his taxes", chirped someone from behind me, amongst laughs and snickers. I snatched my envelope from the table nearby with clenched teeth and stormed off, seriously considering quitting the programme entirely.</p>
<p>I stood on the street corner a few days later with his address in hand, staring doubtfully through the rain at this guy's equivalent of the 'bat cave'. It was a rickety, run down old building sandwiched between two taller red-bricked apartment blocks. Window shutters hung precariously from their hinges and the roof was missing far more than one shingle. "What is <em>with</em> this guy?", I muttered out loud. Superheroes were supposed to be surrounded by high tech screens and speeding sports cars, not some crooked, ancient shack. Driven by a desire to complete my studies and become a superhero myself, a <em>proper</em> superhero, I swallowed my disgust and crossed the street.</p>
<p>I knocked three times and had to wait only a few moments before he was at the door. An older gentleman, shorter than I was expecting, filled the door frame. Round spectacles sat on his face beneath a rapidly balding head. "Yes?", he asked quietly.</p>
<p>I had known almost nothing about Eugene, although he had been arguably more famous at school than maybe even Superman himself, although for entirely different reasons. Nicknamed 'The Weasel', nobody had quite known why he was the only registered superhero to never respond to any crime or impending disaster in the institution's recorded history. Though, of course, there were plenty of rumours.</p>
<p>"Can I help you, young man?", he asked again. I could see why he was nicknamed so now, his mannerisms were somehow decidedly <em>weasel-like</em>. Even the wilt in his voice cast the mind to thoughts of the critter.</p>
<p>"Yes sir, I'm your new, uh...", I cast a weary eye over my shoulder and dropped my voice slightly, "uh, <em>apprentice</em>".</p>
<p>"Oh, that's alright boy, no need for the secrecy", he said, smiling slightly. "Nobody important comes poking around here. Come on in out of that weather."</p>
<p>Inside it was warm and musty, as if the air hadn't moved in a long time. "Now, what is it that you do, uh...?".</p>
<p>"Mitch", I assisted.</p>
<p>"What is it that you do, Mitch?"</p>
<p>"I do?"</p>
<p>"Your power."</p>
<p>"I can influence liquid."</p>
<p>"Is that so?"</p>
<p>I turned to face him. As I stared at him with a slight grin, the raindrops on my coat began to rise, slowly coalescing into a perfect sphere between us.</p>
<p>"Impressive."</p>
<p>"Thank you. And what is it that you do, Mr Lunder?", I asked, dropping the ball of water into a vase nearby.</p>
<p>"Please, call me Eugene", he said, handing me a handkerchief.</p>
<p>"What's this for?"</p>
<p>He smiled at me. "Let's just say, I can tell when things are going to happen."</p>
<p>"You think I'm going to sneeze?"</p>
<p>"I <em>know</em> you're going to sneeze."</p>
<p>Sure enough, before I could answer, I felt the uncontrollable desire to sneeze begin to build in my nasal passage. I blew hard into his handkerchief, but not before making sure it was clean first.</p>
<p>"Bless you."</p>
<p>"Wow, that's amazing! How long can you tell before something happens?"</p>
<p>"Oh, not very long. A few minutes would be stretching it."</p>
<p>"Why aren't you using your powers for good?"</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. "For good?"</p>
<p>"Like, out there fighting villains and shit with the rest of them? You could predict punches before they land!"</p>
<p>He chuckled. "Oh, I'm not one for such antics. It's all about performance with them, isn't it? All throwing fists at each other, trying to make tomorrow's front page. I've never even been in a fight! Besides, I don't see myself wearing spandex any time soon..."</p>
<p>"But what about the fame? The money! The girls! Don't you want any of that? One day, I'm going to have the fastest car money can buy and it will shoot water instead of bullets!"</p>
<p>"Like a fire truck?"</p>
<p>"What? No! What kind of superhero drives a truck?", I laughed out loud. "Any superhero worth his salt has some kind of suped up sports car or motorcycle. It has to be voice-controlled, have cloaking ability, covered in weapons and, I don't know, maybe even be able to fly."</p>
<p>He chuckled softly, shaking his head. "My boy, you have no--". His head shot up, eyes wide. He stood there for a few seconds, almost staring through me, focused on some non-existent point far, far away.</p>
<p>"Something wrong?"</p>
<p>"Quick! We have to go. Come with me!"</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Hurry!"</p>
<p>He lifted his jacket off the coat rack and slipped it on with amazing speed. I followed him out into the drizzle as he hurried down the sidewalk. He had an impressive stride for such a short man; even with my foot or so of height over him, I had a hard time keeping pace.</p>
<p>"May I ask where we're going?"</p>
<p>"Just follow me. Quickly now!"</p>
<p>We turned two corners and came to a rest outside a grocery store, huddled under an awning.</p>
<p>"What are we doing here?"</p>
<p>He rose a finger to his lips before grabbing me by the arms and thrusting me into a spot just beside the shop's glass door. I was amazed by the strength this old, frail man had. There was definitely something 'super' about him, although you couldn't tell for looking.</p>
<p>"Ever play any baseball?"</p>
<p>"A little in high school"</p>
<p>"What position?"</p>
<p>"Fielder mostly"</p>
<p>"Perfect. Wait right here."</p>
<p>He stepped out from under the awning and took position alongside the road. </p>
<p>"What is <em>with</em> this guy?", I muttered softly for the second time today. </p>
<p>A few moments later, the shop's door swung open, accompanied by the faint ring of a bell and the noise of conversation inside. A young woman stepped out with a paper grocery bag under one arm and an umbrella under the other. It might have been the cold air or the damp road, but she suddenly remembered the reason she carried that umbrella and set about opening it, crossing the sidewalk in front of me, still clutching the grocery bag to her side. Her attention not on her feet, she stepped into a puddle and lost her footing, slipping on the wet surface.</p>
<p>She spun wildly, trying to catch herself. As she did so, she sent her umbrella and grocery bag flying. The umbrella clattered onto the ground, the paper bag right into my open arms. I looked up, astonished. There he was, almost hidden by her, holding her securely under her arms. Then it hit me. <em>He knew.</em> He had planned this all.</p>
<p>"Steady on", he said kindly, helping her to her feet.</p>
<p>"Wha? I... thank you!", she said, clearly frazzled.</p>
<p>"Not at all. How lucky that my grandson and I were here to help! And look at that, he's managed to save your groceries. We were just entering the store ourselves."</p>
<p>"I can't thank you enough", she gushed, straightening her coat.</p>
<p>"Well, you're very welcome. Do try and be careful where you step, lots of accidents in this weather", he said, handing her her umbrella.</p>
<p>She smiled at me as I passed over her grocery bag, thanked us again, then set off on her way down the sidewalk with a more ~~weary~~ wary gait. I turned back and found him leaning against the grocery store wall, cleaning puddle water off his glasses.</p>
<p>"All in a day's work, my boy", he said behind grin.</p>
<p>"That was awesome!". I struggled to contain my enthusiasm at that point. "How often do you do that?"</p>
<p>"As often as I can. I've spared many a sprained ankle or broken arm, you know, but every so often I get a chance to do something far more meaningful - save a life. You'd be surprised just how many people cross the street without looking around here."</p>
<p>As he stood there before me, wiping his foggy spectacles, I began to realise that I really was in the company of a superhero. One that sought not fortune or fame, but the wellness of others, even those he'd never met. Enamoured with my adolescent thoughts for capes, cars and crap loads of money, I'd never realised what it truly was to be a <em>super</em> hero. I stood for a moment in silence, humbled entirely by this small man before me.</p>
<p>"Right", he said, pushing the frames squarely onto his face, "ready for lesson two?".</p>

<p>Score: 460</p>
<p>An archaeologist sat and scanned through the final documents of his project. All seemed in order. The dates for everything had been checked and scrutinised, the earliest artefact dating from around 2003, the latest somewhere close to 2088. He began to relay his findings to a new member of staff.</p>
<p>“So we think that around the early few decades of the 21st century, this new totalitarian civilisation really began to thrive. It was led by a single figure, a God. You can see by the orange, vacant stare of the eyes and that wild smile. He was in control.”  </p>
<p>“So they really worshipped this guy?”</p>
<p>“Totally. He was like, the leader of the world. Any changes, any advancements, affected everyone.” </p>
<p>“Everyone?” </p>
<p>“They needed him. How do you think they paid for things? ‘Upvotes’ were the means to everything. Buying, selling, trading, validation, self-worth. It all came down to numbers. News came through from him, entertainment came from him, it was all through his word. I don’t want to imagine what happened to those who got ‘downvotes’.” </p>
<p>They sat back for a second and pondered.</p>
<p>“And he was the head figure?” </p>
<p>“A dictator of sorts. A silent, muted character. Didn’t say much, but was always just…there. People separated into tribes, colonies. You had those who were known as “OP’s”. Information came mostly from them and then others would feed off of it, discussing it. Then you had “moderators”, a sort of policing of the people. They could remove people from society, or ban them from certain areas.” </p>
<p>“Areas?” </p>
<p>“Well, they were called subreddits then. Presumably, they were extensions of the dictator’s motives, cities under his ruling. They’d be sectioned off and kept to only discussing specific things and any off-topic conversation would be met with force from a moderator or a bot.” </p>
<p>“Sounds brutal.” </p>
<p>“Oh it was. An entire population at the mercy of “moderators”, scrounging for “upvotes” just to survive. Each person had “karma”, a sort of credit score. If you had a higher ‘karma’ number you were deemed more valuable, more experienced. It defined them as a people.” </p>
<p>“I can’t imagine living like that.”</p>
<p>“And then there was ‘gold’. Presumably it was a secret, more elite group. They had access to resources that most others didn’t. They could filter things, tailor their information. From what we can tell, normal citizens would scrounge amongst themselves in the hope that they’d get access to this ‘gold’. It was a rare and violent occurrence.”</p>
<p>“What did this society call themselves?” </p>
<p>The archaeologist looked up from his papers. </p>
<p>“Reddit.” </p>

<h1>[IP] I'm Done As Promised &lt;3 Mom [possible NSFW]</h1>
<p>Score: 421</p>
<p>"She's always protecting you."</p>
<p>My dad had always told me that my mom was watching over us.  Ever since she had died giving birth to me, he had said that she was always watching my shoulder.  When I was young, that was what I believed.    </p>
<p>He gave me a chalk one day and said, "Whenever you are alone, write to your mother." </p>
<p>"Why?"  </p>
<p>"It's a special chalk," he assured, "Your mother will be able to see everything you write with this chalk."  After that, I was determined that my mom would protect me no matter what.  In hindsight, it was probably an ordinary piece of chalk, but as a kid it meant the world to me.</p>
<p>Of course when I was 8, a couple of the other boys during recess asked me about my parents and about the chalk.<br />
"I live alone with my dad."  The answer was simple.</p>
<p>"Why?" one of the bigger kids had asked.  He was a simple kid that liked to poke fun of everyone.  Maybe he had his own problems, maybe he didn't.  Last time I heard of him, he had his own logistics company, "Did your parents divorce?"</p>
<p>"No, my mom's in heaven," I pipped cheerfully, "But she's always looking out for me!"</p>
<p>I never found out what was so funny, nor did I understand why everyone was laughing at me.  But I do remember the senseless beatings I had received several years henceforth, kids poking fun and asking "Where is your mom now?" and "Why are you still writing with chalk?"</p>
<p>I never let my dad know, but I always wrote on the sidewalk in front of our house, letting her know how my day was.</p>
<p><em>Mommy, I ate my carrots today.</em></p>
<p><em>Mommy, I drew a picture of you in heaven.</em></p>
<p><em>Mommy, I miss you.</em></p>
<p>But as I grew older, the messages were written less and less, but I had always kept the tiny bit of chalk in the back of my wallet.  </p>
<p>Then came <em>that</em> day.</p>
<p>I was in love with soccer in high school and made the team my freshman year.  And wouldn't you know it?  My dad wasn't able to drive me to my first home game, the big one.  The one that would establish my popularity.  Don't laugh, we all thought like that in high school.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Andrew," he apologized that morning, "But I got a meeting and I won't be able to help you."  I was silent, betrayed by the fact that I wouldn't be able to play.  In hindsight, I could've probably called a friend but I couldn't control my emotions as I shouted, "THIS IS WHY YOU AREN'T MOM!"</p>
<p>The dad was silent but left without saying another word. I saw the tear fall down his cheek as he went to work, and I felt awful.  My dad was both my dad and mom growing up, and here I was being insensitive.</p>
<p>I took out my chalk and scribbled the last message I would ever write on the sidewalk.</p>
<p><em>I hate you.</em></p>
<p>My mother had abandoned me when I needed her the most.  She was never there for me.  She wasn't there for my first word, or my first steps.  I was filled with anger that day and chucked my chalk out into the woods.  I never needed it again, and I had accepted that my mother was gone from my life.  Or rather, she had never been there.</p>
<p>Life had moved on and soon, I went to college out-of-state.  My dad had sent the occasional text and money, asking how I was doing.  It killed me over the years as I studied, whenever I got drunk I would always ask myself, "What were the colors of my mom's eyes?  What was her favorite song?"  I never knew love and graduated with a degree in engineering and a few friends.</p>
<p>And it was the night before graduation.  Every damn paper turned in, every thesis corrected and submitted, and every exam was done.  My roommates and I hosted a party, the biggest one we had hosted as everyone continued to get drunk.  The music and alcohol was relaxing, but by the end of the night all of my roommates had left the place with other friends of the female variety.</p>
<p>"Are you not coming?" one of them asked me. </p>
<p>"Naw," I let him down easy, "I'm going to relax."</p>
<p>I cleaned up the apartment slowly to some Sara Bareilles.  As I hummed "Gravity" to myself, I couldn't help but notice the pavement on our balcony.  Some smart ass had brought some chalk along and decided to scribble all over the floor.  I gave a small chuckle and wrote a small message.</p>
<p><em>I'm done as promised.</em></p>
<p>It was short, but it conveyed all the frustration I had to deal with in my life until then.  But realizing the landlord would have a fit, I washed down the pavement, erasing all the messages for an hour and threw the chalk away.  I recycled the empty bottles and rearranged everything in its proper place.  I went to bed slightly drunk but satisfied.</p>
<p>I woke up to a call the next day from my father.  It was strange, because he never usually called.</p>
<p>"Hey dad."</p>
<p>"Andrew, how are you?"</p>
<p>"Just a little tired,  what's up?" I yawned.</p>
<p>"I had a dream about your mother yesterday night," his voice was shaking, "She told me that she's proud of  you." </p>
<p>I sighed a little.  "Dad, we've been over this," I began, "I know you love her, but we need to-"</p>
<p>"No Andrew," he interrupted, "She told me to tell you that you might have forgotten her, but she has never forgotten you."</p>
<p>I scoffed as he continued, "We both love you, Andrew."</p>
<p>"Alright Dad," I began to hang up, "I'll talk to you later."</p>
<p>I hung up the call without waiting for a response.  My stomach began to rumble but I didn't feel the desire to cook.  "Maybe I can get some Dennys," I muttered as I reached for my wallet, "Hangover food's the best."  I walked out of the bedroom with a fresh T shirt and jeans, looking around the place as I left.</p>
<p>Something out of the corner of my eye caught my attention.  </p>
<p>The balcony pavement.  A scribbled message was still there from last night.</p>
<p><em>But that's impossible, I erased everything.</em></p>
<p>I moved closer and froze, a tear forming in the corner of my eye as I read the message I had scribbled last night.  </p>
<p><em>I'm done as promised.</em></p>
<p>It was my handwriting, but I knew I had erased it.  I reached into my wallet and looked through the back pocket.  In there, I found the very same small piece of chalk that I had thrown into the woods all those years ago.</p>
<p>Below my message were two words written with it.</p>
<p><em>Love, Mom.</em></p>

<p>With all of his friends distracted by the spectacle, Richard hovered into an alleyway between two separate McDonald's restaurants.  Once he was alone, he leapt from his hover chair and detached the bag of sand from his stomach.  It clapped to the ground and his chair almost flew into the air, relieved of its burden.  He tore off the fake legs, arms, and face fat and leapt into action.  It took him just a matter of minutes to change into his costume and assume his other identity: Cardio Man.</p>

<p>"No time," he replied.  "You aren't strong enough to pull the man from the ledge.  And I'm not quick enough to reach the top in time.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"</p>
<p>Cardio Man grinned.  "It's Cardio Time!"</p>
<p>The Bulking Kid jumped onto Cardio Man's shoulders, and the superhero began to lightly jog toward the building.  A crack of stone broke away, and the spectators gasped in fear.  Then, without warning, Cardio Man's light jog broke into a moderately paced jog, and the citizens of New York applauded.  Within less than ten minutes, they were at the top of the twenty story building, thoroughly winded but otherwise undefeated.</p>
<p>"Please save me!" the man at the ledge said.  "I want to live!"</p>
<p>The man sat a few feet from his hoverchair, reaching his chubby fingers out for something to save him. </p>

<p>Something popped in the lander as soon as we entered the atmosphere. One second it was smooth sailing, and then the next we were being tossed around the cabin like kids on a carnival ride. Alarms were blaring and lights were flashing as fires broke out in the left wing. There was nothing we could do but brace for impact.</p>
<p>Novikov and Chambers died immediately, so far as I could tell. I didn't have much time to examine their bodies on the way out  of the wreckage, but a part of the lander windshield was sticking out of Novikov's chest, so that one wasn't much of a mystery. Chambers may have survived the impact, but her suit faceplate was shattered, so she hadn't lasted long in this atmosphere. I could already see the oxygen levels dropping on my own monitors. Should have known that my suit wouldn't make it through unscathed. </p>
<p>"Valerie, I'm sorry," I spoke into the microphone. The lander was supposed to be able to relay back to Earth, but something told me that the twisted, burning pile of metal wouldn't be able to handle the job anymore. So it just went to a recording. "As always, you were right, honey." She hadn't wanted me to go. She'd never worried about any of my other missions, but this one had caused a pretty big fight between us. Superstitious as always, she just had a 'bad feeling' about this one in the pit of her stomach. </p>
<p>I gazed out across the unfamiliar landscape. The system's sun, roughly twice the size of our own, was just starting to rise on the horizon. I tried to pick out Sol from the blanket of stars above, but there were too many. I'd seen the star map from our proposed landing site, but we hadn't gotten that far. Shame; I would have liked to have one last glimpse of home. But this desolate world was beautiful in its own way </p>
<p>I sighed and took a seat on a nearby rock and gazed out over the plains. So much for my "Neil Armstrong" moment. Instead of triumphantly stepping out the door and planting the N.A.U. flag, I was just choosing the spot where I wanted to die. "I hope that someday you'll get this message." That wasn't a sure bet: a recovery mission could take forever, and she might die of old age before anyone could get it back to her. By the time this message made it back to Earth, she would have moved on already. Probably with a new husband, and bunch of kids. "Just know how much I love you, and miss you." Images of her flooded back into my mind: trading shy glances at the university library; the happy tears in her eyes during our first dance; having a food fight at the ripe old age of 31. I wanted to remind her of all of those times, but the oxygen alarm was quickly inching toward critical. I could even feel the cold beginning to seep through the holes in the suit. "I just hope you know how much our time together meant to me."</p>
<p>A crack spread across the vizor like a drip of water running down a pane of glass. Smaller and smaller cracks radiated outward until the whole thing was covered in a spiderweb of lines. Red lights were flashing, and a distant voice was warning me that internal atmosphere had reached critical levels. I thought of Val kissing me goodbye on the capsule's threshold the day I'd departed. The thought of her warm touch (and, stubborn determination) made me smile, and I closed my eyes. She'd embraced me and didn't let go, as though she might hug me so long that I'd miss the departure window. I could picture every single freckle on her beautiful face. "I wish you could see what I see," I gasped into the recorder. </p>

<p>Score: 387</p>
<p>Death introduced himself to me when I was fifty-five years old and suffered a heart attack. He visited me in the hospital, pulling a chair up next to my bed. "I've come to take you back with me. But when I reached for you a moment ago a force pushed me away." </p>
<p>"Maybe it's not my time, then."</p>
<p>"I don't come if it's not your time," Death leaned back, his hood casting his face in shadow. He hovered his hand above me and then brought his fingers down as if to touch me. A moment later he drew his hand back.</p>
<p>"But maybe I'm mistaken," his voice was soft. "Maybe this is not your time." </p>
<p>The next time I met Death I was sixty-seven years old. I had fallen down the stairs and was resting in bed. Again he sat next to me. I could not see his face but I imagined that his eyes were boring into me looking for an answer. "I remember you," he said. "You were my one mistake. But this...it can't be a coincidence." </p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I sat back against my pillows, but he was gone. </p>
<p>That was when I realized the truth of my immortality. I reached the age of 102 without meeting Death again. And then a peculiar thing happened. With time the aches in my joints began to fade. My skin became tighter, my hair regained its color.</p>
<p>I met Death again when I was forty-five. "Every day I get a call for you," he told me from his chair. "For five decades I've ignored them. I've not wanted to see you or acknowledge what you are. But each day I think of you. I come to visit you, and I watch you grow younger. You are my only burden."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," and I was. It had been a century since I had seen him last. "You've taken everyone else from me. I'm alone now."</p>
<p>"Everyone dies. Everyone but you, it seems. They do not suffer when they go. I am not cruel." </p>
<p>He reached out to touch me and I felt prickling on the skin that he nearly touched. "Is it strange to want you? To want to speak to you? To want to know why you are different from all the others?" </p>
<p>"You seem to be immortal too."</p>
<p>"I am...hard to explain," he linked his fingers together. I wished I could see his face. "I am not a human."</p>
<p>"Are you a ghost? A god?"</p>
<p>"No," he said. "I am something unexplainable." </p>
<p>I saw him next when I was seventeen and got into a car crash. He sat next to my hospital bed. I admired the changes in technology. </p>
<p>"Tell me something," he moved closer to my bedside, his familiar fingers hovering over me. "You haven't taken any lovers since last we spoke. You have few friends. You sit and read most of the time. Do you take your youth for granted?"</p>
<p>"It's...hard to explain," I smiled at him. "My friends would get older while I got younger. My relationships would be ruined. What is the point? I imagine I will one day age again, but by that point I will be 204 years old. I will know far more of the past than any who would want to befriend me." </p>
<p>Death sat silently by my side for some time, the only sound the beeping of machinery. "Maybe it's true," he mused. "That you want only what you can't have." </p>
<p>The next time I remember seeing him I was six, aging up again. He came to visit me one night as I slept in my house.</p>
<p>"Why did it take you so long to come?" I asked him. "You told me once that you are called to me each day. Did you not want to see me?"</p>
<p>I looked down at my small frame while he spoke. The body was a strange thing. I could not remember anything between the ages of 3 and again 3. It was strange to again be a child. </p>
<p>"I came for you every day," Death said. "I came to feed you when you could not. I brought those who had died to your side. I wanted to know you. I read your journals. I'm sorry for that."</p>
<p>"Will you leave again for a time now?" I drew my knees up to my chest.</p>
<p>"I will bring you things until you are old enough to do them yourself. I will care for your money."</p>
<p>I saw Death each month until I was again eighteen. Sitting in his chair, I smiled to greet the old friend. "I want to know you," I told him. He was still for a long time and then he reached up to draw back his hood. I looked upon Death's face, and I was not afraid. I reached out to touch him, but as I drew near a shock went through my hand. </p>
<p>"You told me once you were hard to explain. That you were not god nor ghost. What are you? How did you come to be death?"</p>
<p>"It's a story that would take centuries to tell, Abigail," his hands reached to touch near the nape of my neck. </p>
<p>"Then it's lucky that I'm immortal." </p>
<p>Death smiled. </p>

<h1>[WP] Just like normal citizens, time travelers have a code of laws they have to follow. Don't change the past. Don't talk to past versions of yourself. Most importantly, don't show up to Stephen Hawking's party.</h1>
<p>Score: 379</p>
<p>Many people before the invention of time travel thought of time as a linearly branching relationship from cause to effect, cause to effect, cause to effect. Make different choices, end up in a different place. There were stories about how something as small as stepping on a butterfly could change the course of history. </p>
<p>Now we know better. Time does not branch like a tree, it flows like a river. Much like a river flows around a rock, time will flow around most disturbances. There may be minor differences, but the overall flow of history will remain the same. Time wants to happen.</p>
<p>But there are certain points in history where the timeline is weak, malleable. These are the moments that are still taught in elementary schools today due to their importance, as they ultimately dictated the flow of time. Imagine a bend in a river; with a big enough disturbance, the river could break free of its banks and flow in an entirely different direction.</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler. He was a bend in the river of time. His actions inadvertently led to humanity's nuclear age, computer age, and space age. As awful as his actions were, the innovations caused by the war to stop him became vital to humanity's future.</p>
<p>The Black Death. Another bend, in which a third of the population of Europe died. However, if there was no Black Death, a man named Isaac Newton would not have left the city to avoid the sickness, and therefore the sciences would have stagnated for nearly a hundred years.</p>
<p>The biggest bend of all in the river of time is the bend of Stephen Hawking. A brilliant physicist in the 20th and 21st Centuries, Hawking is infamous among the time-travelling community for a party which he held in the year 2009. He told nobody about the party until after it ended, and used the lack of attendance as evidence that time travel is impossible.</p>
<p>Naturally, this party has become a classic first trip for young adults who get their time travelling license. It's against the rules, of course, but there's an entire division of the Time Protectorate devoted to undoing the damage that people cause by showing up.</p>
<p>What do you mean, "What damage"? Do I have to break it down for you?</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>If people from the future show up to his party, he has proof that time travel is possible. If he has proof that it's possible, he devotes the rest of his life to figuring out how. When he dies, his notes get stored at Cambridge in the Archives until a student 50 years later is looking at them and realizes something that Hawking missed. She'll work in her apartment to set up a prototype. But that will be in the year 2074 - a full century before the QRM model is supposed to be discovered, so she won't be able to accurately combine quantum mechanics and general relativity. The result is that she inadvertently creates a wormhole to nowhere which causes most of England to be sucked into oblivion. The resulting fear and panic caused humanity's desire for progress to wilt; frankly speaking, a fate worse than death for a species such as ours.</p>
<p>Progress is all that we have. We are not strong, we are not fast. Since the Dawn of Man, we as a species have survived through progress. We progressed from flint spearheads to bronze, to iron, to steel. We progressed from foraging to hunting to agriculture. Everything that our species has, we have because we looked at what we were given and said "This is not enough. We can be more."</p>
<h2>And Hawking's party takes that away from us.</h2>

She would always remember the first time they met, hitting it off in a crowded bar much like this one before saying goodnight as they stood in the pouring rain. He had brushed her nose with his fingertip ever so lightly and her heart had skipped and the feeling had coursed through her, addictive and drawing her in, making her desperate for another touch.</p>
<p>"Hey, Margaret," he repeated, snapping her out of her daydreams and she realized she had completely missed what he had been saying. She blushed a bit redder and grinned in embarrassment at the growing dampness she felt. "You wanna get out of here and head back to my place?" he asked over the din of the bar as other patrons shoved and jockeyed for the bartender's attention. She nodded timidly, biting her lower lip and reaching for him.</p>
<p>"First, come here though," she cooed seductively, grabbing his hand and pulling him close. "Poke me," she said as crudely as she could manage, raising his wrist to her face. He grinned deviously, and used his free hand to adjust the growing bulge in his pants and she smiled, well aware of the effect she was having.</p>
<p>"I would love to," he whispered, bringing his outstretched index finger to her nose and shoving it upwards. She moaned in satisfaction, reaching out to do the same to him. "You can pick your friends, you can pick your nose, but other than that, you can only pick your partner's nose," he murmured provocatively, the passionate scene drawing stares from other customers. He stepped back, gazing into her blue eyes as he left his finger up her nostril. "Your perfect nose is the only nose I would ever want to pick."</p>

<p>Black Dagger came at me, faster than any human eye could see. I actually think she hit Mach 2, from the sonic boom.</p>
<p>I'd moved before she'd even started running. Her hyper-speed punch hit the air, creating a pretty nasty shockwave that I was able to ride out by dropping down to one knee. By the time she realized she hadn't actually hit me, I was already up. She ran away from me - a few yards, enough to get another running start - and came again, both fists raised. Sloppy. I sidestepped her and the resulting shockwave, but remained close this time. By the time she stopped, I was right behind her. I karate-chopped her in the neck as hard as I could - no need to hold back with superhumans - and she dropped to one knee. While she was disoriented, I put her in a hold and waited for the count.</p>
<p>"And... Ravindra wins!" came Coach Coldsteel's voice</p>
<p>"Thanks, coach" I said, helping Black Dagger up. I wasn't thanking him for the victory - I was grateful he didn't call me Battleaxe. My parents insisted I take that name because you need to have a superhero identity to enroll here, but I hated it. They wanted "something badass for a future superhero", they said. With both my parents being superhumans - One of the most famous superheroines of her age and the first supervillain to truly reform out of love - everyone expected me to develop powers sooner or later. Even though it hadn't happened by the time I hit high-school age, I'd gone to the superhuman school. After all, it was bound to happen sooner or later, right?</p>
<p>Well it still hadn't. And while I'd begged and begged not to go at first, while everyone (myself included) expected me to get flattened against a wall in three days, I was actually enjoying it here.</p>
<p>You see, it turns out superheroes? They're a bunch of one-trick ponies. The girl with hyperspeed will solve every problem using her hyperspeed, the super-strong kid will hammer away until it works out for him, the sonic-screamer, the telepath... They are hammers living in a world of nails. Whereas I've had time to learn to be something else.</p>
<p>When I was three, the Siren attacked my parents at home while I was napping. I had to toddle through her screams, bleeding from my ears, until I could find safety while my parents fought her. When I was six, Mind-Twister commanded me to go kill them in their sleep. I was in their bedroom with the kitchen knife when I finally got rid of his telepathic compulsion. And I'm not even counting the time Bullfighter tried to kill me to break their spirits... I had to roll exactly the right way with his super-strong punches so that I'd just get bruised and not pulped on the spot.</p>
<p>I didn't expect all that to pay off so well. To me, it was a part of surviving from one day to the next. But by not having a superpower, a magic solution to my problems, I'd learned to make my own.</p>
<p>So I read a speedster's movements before they run and predict their intent. I avoid the super-strong's attacks and conserve my energy until they tire out. I press into my head at exactly the right point to protect my inner ear from the screamers, I count Fibonacci sequences and prime numbers to keep my mind clear of the telepath's presence, I stay low on the ground to negate the flyers' advantage, I roll at the right time to avoid the firebreather's flames.</p>
<p>That's the thing with superhumans, you see. Once you take away their one trick, they don't know jack. They have no other way of solving a problem. That's why I'm not Battleaxe. That's a superhero's name.</p>

<p>Score: 331</p>
<p>At the ripe old age of fifty-three, Tim was Nixville's oldest eligible bachelor, a record he had held for a decade. All that would change today: Tim had decided there was no time like the present to start a family. </p>
<p>First, Tim needed someone to be his wife. Kids nowadays use the Internet for that kind of stuff, but Tim was an old-fashioned guy; he liked to court his prospects in person. In Nixville, you could usually find tons of single ladies at Fresh Cherries, the local alternative dancing studio. Tim made his way over there and asked for Felicia, the most beautiful dancer there. For the past ten years, Tim had visited Felicia every Saturday night. They knew each other very well, and Tim had decided it was time to move forward with their relationship.</p>
<p>Now, Tim had seen Felicia with a lot of other men. He knew that she loved him the most, but he needed to be extra sure. That's why he slipped a love potion into her drink. In the private room they shared, Tim watched Felicia dance, occasionally directing her movements with a heavy hand. After awhile, Felicia's eyes began to droop, and she eventually slumped into his arms, deep in slumber, a sign of the potion's success. A modern day Sleeping Beauty, she would only be awakened by a kiss from her prince, which Tim was all too happy to do. Repeatedly. Keen on avoiding needless confrontation with her jealous suitors, Tim gently draped her over his shoulder and darted out the window.</p>
<p>The act of marriage is commonly referred to as "tying the knot." Just one knot, mind you. But Tim was an overprotective man; he ended up tying four knots to secure Felicia's hands (and feet) in marriage. Exhausted, he fell asleep next to his new wife.</p>
<p>Marriage isn't always sunshine and roses. Every couple has its arguments, and Tim and Felicia were no exception. Their first took place the next morning. Tim had a wicked sense of humor, you know. To avoid undue conflict, he slapped a piece of duct tape across Felicia's mouth. Then he was off: Tim wasn't quite finished with his family yet.</p>
<p>You've probably noticed by now that Tim still needed a kid of his own. And just how does one go about acquiring one of those, you ask? You guessed it: the shopping mall. Tim drove over to the Galleria and began looking out for one of those poor, abandoned kids with no parents that you tend to see from time to time. Eventually, he saw a young boy of maybe six wandering around, in danger of being trampled by the mobs of shoppers flocking from store to store. Tim ran over to him, saving him from potential disaster, and promised him a ice cream cone and a lifetime of affection. And just like that, Tim had found himself a son. </p>
<p>Now, I said earlier Tim was an old-fashioned guy. He thought himself the man of the household, the head honcho of the family. He ruled his little kingdom with an iron fist. Sadly, such traditional family values are forever under attack nowadays. In the small town of Nixville, there were some people who just didn't understand Tim's way of doing things. One night, the doorbell rang, and Tim opened the door to a group of thirty angry townspeople.</p>
<p>"Tim, we've come to bring you to justice."</p>
<p>Let it be known that Tim defended his family until his last breath. They were too much for him, though. The mob dragged him by his feet over to the old oak tree in his front yard and tossed a rope over his head. Like the children they were, they turned him into a human tire swing, pushing him back and forth beneath the bough until they got bored. </p>
<h2>That was years ago. Tim and his family are long gone now, but rumor has it in the town of Nixville that whenever a child gets lost in the mall, old Tim will be there in a flash to offer them a place in his loving home.</h2>

<p>The scopes simply ceased to penetrate any further. At first he and his crew had believed it to be an error with the system, however the closer they approached, the more wild the gravitational field became, erratic disturbances in the quantum foam and the Wall revealed itself.</p>
<p>A solid field of pure energy, the matter contained within in packed tighter than should have been physically possible. Yet from it emanated a low-level electromagnetic transmission, pulsing steady from beyond the veil on every single wavelength simultaneously. They had needed to filter out the visible light hours ago, the strobing rising in intensity as the ship had approached, seemingly detecting its presence.</p>
<p>Increasing the power of the scanners yielded nothing; the wall was impenetrable and could have been anywhere from thousand of miles thick to barely one atom. It was impossible, a featureless shifting of existence.</p>
<p>It was wrong.</p>
<p>Such a construct could only be artificial, and the endless non-space before them forced itself onto his mind, the impossibility of it ripping out his soul and leaving a bare husk as he failed to make sense of the situation. He tried to remain calm but found nothing inside him that he could reason with.</p>
<p><em>You're a scientist, damn it!</em> he thought to himself, <em>Get your shit together!</em></p>
<p>Watched eagerly by his co-pilot, he brought a tentative hand across the console, swiping a finger downwards to release a survey drone, the system chiming happily in response. </p>
<p>The fibres of the drone ignited a fierce blue as the machine burned its way between the gap, transmitting data back to the ship. On the scanner Alex kept a close eye on the drone, scanning through the rapid influx of data, which was no different to what had already been produced. </p>

<p>Everything changed the day gorgemochs arrived in their large spacecraft. Nobody predicted the true outcome. </p>
<p>In the year of their arrival, 2016, I was but a wee lad, 8 years old and barely over a meter tall. The first thing I remember was panic. All of the teachers ended class and we watched it on television. Floating over parliaments, searching for the 'leaders' of Earth. By it of course I mean the mothership. </p>
<p>Massive in size, just larger than the state of Illinois in total sq. Kilometres. One by one the mothership was directed to the United States as the leaders, after receiving this information and destroying whatever capital building one had with an impressive flash of light the ship flew on. Upon reaching the North America's and observing the flag raised proudly in the front, 50 stars, 13 stripes, something? Someone? Came down. Immediately surrendering itself in front of the countries prime building, turns out that surrender is largely the same in every language, on the floor with your hands extended, or, errr, <em>feelers</em> in its case. The whole world sat waiting while the thing was taken into the white house. </p>
<p>My mother received me from school. My father met us at home, a large man like him shouldn't need to carry a gun. We passed a few cities on the way out to the country. I didn't comprehend what I saw from a distance. Masses of people, broken storefronts, thick black smoke, but no sirens to be heard. </p>
<p>After a few days the white house was blacked out from the tree of the world. The army surrounded it. Anybody brave enough to attempt to pass their brigade was shot dead on sight. No words for a week while the rest of the world spiral'd into chaos. No police force our military could withstand the fear of the masses while themselves had been shaken from the very core. Civilization was falling.</p>
<p>The mothership after distributing its one unit flee'd to hover with the moon, floating in the night sky, watching Earth. </p>
<p>Finally, on noon of the eighth day the white house made contact. The remaining leaders of the world were gathered. They talked for mere hours before the president was put on television. He said simply. "The extraterrestrial species are scared of the United Stars of Alliance, or U.S.A., as commonly referred to, they've formerly apologized for invading such a powerful empire and are begging forgiveness. Their mothership contains the last of their species. Earth was the very last habitable planet they could make it to before the last of their fuel was used.

<p>Score: 311</p>
<p>I am certain now the numbers ten through eight were whispered in my ear when I was too young to recall. Ten might have been uttered by some nurse in the delivery room, under florescent lights with my mother covered in sweat and blood.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I heard six, at my fifteenth birthday, that I knew this wasn't some random bit of conversation I was hearing. It, because the gender and appearance changed every time, was always just out of sight when it happened. Some random passerby in a crowd. I had seen them, but not entirely focused enough to remember their face. But it was always clear and left no doubt in my mind when it occurred. Though only a whisper escaping from this thing's mouth, it echoed and vibrated the very air around me. I never felt threatened. By number four I had decided it was some force of the universe I could not control, and accepted this notices as one takes mail from a letterbox.</p>
<p>Number five was while I was at college. Like any young man who had recently escaped his parents watchful eye, I was making mistakes. This party was full of similar young adults who would not remember the evening. As a took a drink and stared into the bottom of my cup I was notified again. "Five." Even over the blaring music and voices of several dozen students, I heard it clear as a bell. It reverberated in my chest and ears. Thanks for the message.</p>
<p>Four was in my first year at my job that accidentally became a career. I wrote content for websites. A thrilling use of my writing skill when novel writing had proven too difficult. My back ached with weeks of sitting in the same chair, in the same cubicle, looking at a screen that had become my life. As I typed with the speed only an experienced workaholic obtains, I heard it again. The mail cart had just made the rounds; I rarely received anything. As the man pushing the cart escaped out of sight, it rang in my chest and ears again. "Four."</p>
<p>The next came much sooner than I expected. At home, alone like every night before, I heard some party my neighbors were throwing in the apartment below mine. I didn't recognize the music and assumed they were much younger than I. Avoiding a confrontation I decided to simply increase the volume of my TV and fall asleep on the couch. Right before drifting off I heard my neighbors from across the hall come home with friends. As they search through clattering keys, laughing from a night of adventure, I heard it again. "Three." Not since childhood had I been afraid like this by the message. It was quickly on the heels of Four, what had changed?</p>
<p>Not long after, I knew why Three had come so quickly. My eyes, usually such a brilliant display of white with azure, were now yellowing. My skin itched and darkened as well. Stomach pains kept me awake half the night. They say knowing is better than not knowing, but truthfully they are equal. Knowledge does not change any man's fate. Our journeys are through different fields, at different paces, but we all arrive at the same place. After the doctor had told me the news, with me dressed in a paper gown, in a room of beeping machines and white walls, I knew my visitor was not far behind. That night, as a nurse took note of the numbers on my machines, giving me a smile of assurance, I heard it just before she closed the door behind her. "Two." This was the first time it let me notice it so openly. It was clear we would be meeting soon enough that the secrecy was no longer needed.</p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer. My odds of survival were approximately six percent. There was hardly any time to mourn my own life or remember the five stages of grief I was allotted. Four months. They gave me only four months, but it was month three and seemed close to the end. The staff made me comfortable and alleviated any pain they could. My two visitors were work acquaintances, not even friends really. My parents had passed years ago and I had no siblings to speak of. Cousins, uncles, and aunts were only names I had been told in conversations. Any of them could have come and I would have no reference for their faces. When it came this time, I awoke to find it sitting by my bed, assuming the form of an orderly. There was no need for words or declarations of intent. It grabbed my hand, smiled weakly, and stared into my terrified eyes. "One."</p>
<p>My room faded from view, the air too hot and cold all at once. My mouth dry, as my tongue felt brittle enough to crack and disappear into dust. My doctors visited often now. Adjusting my IV bag and injecting medication straight into the line of plastic tubing. It didn't hurt anymore. Nothing was anything now. Over the chaos of hospital staff coming and going from my room, I noticed one shape in the corner who had not moved an inch. It was beautiful this time. I wondered if this was its true shape, but thought it mattered little now. It walked to the side of my bed, grabbing my hand like it had only a few days ago. The same weak smile crossed its mouth, this time with tears in its eyes. I nodded to show I understood now. It leaned down, kissed my forehead through a thick layer of sweat. Everything began to fade away, as if I was being pulled backward into a tunnel. But my messenger never left, still clutching my hand, tears in its eyes. But the smile was weak anymore. It was joyous. The grin of a friend at the sound of good news. I felt the same, though I can't explain why. We were serene and safe.</p>

<p>From the drone's perspective overhead, the four sleek forms of the lions stalking through the grass were clearly visible. But Sean Edmunds, desperately trying to light a fire to ward against just such an attack, couldn't see it coming. The cameras swooped in lower for a better up-close shot. Panic spread across his face in glorious 4K resolution as he realized what was happening; there's only one reason they'd want a close-up. His head swiveled around wildly, trying to figure out what was after him. The last thing he saw was head lioness's tawny fur as her jaws closed around his neck.</p>
<p>"Oh, Edmunds is <em>OUT</em>!" Bill Braddock shouted into his microphone, thumping his fist on the table in the commentators booth. "We all knew that one was coming, but it's still always a bit of a shock to see!" The cameras swooped off to focus on the remaining contestants; polling found that the audience loved seeing the kill shots, but that scenes of the carnage aftermath tended to make viewership plummet.</p>
<p>"Even more shocking is that it was <em>Edmunds</em>," added his co-host Amanda DeVance. On screen, his biography and stats popped up. "I mean, he was a safari leader in Kenya for two years! He's the <em>last</em> one I expected to die from a lion attack!"</p>
<p>"Oh, absolutely," Braddock agreed. "In the latest betting pool, the odds-on favorite was that he would be bitten by one of the giant mosquitoes." The cameras switched to one of the massive pests that were currently hovering near the lake in the middle of the island. The autopsy on Shively wasn't done yet, but the doctor's preliminary conclusion was that they carried some sort of unknown pathogen that caused her death in a matter of hours. "In fact Edmunds kne.... Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt, but it looks like we may have our next roll!"</p>
<p>The cameras trained on four members of the red team who were dashing through the jungle. They'd managed to spot the Blue Team's camp, where the Jumangi board was currently located. To prevent speed-throughs (where players just swiftly rolled the dice before any of the ill effects could actually occur), the board's location was changed after every roll, and teams had to scour the jungle to find it. Blue had made it to the board first this time.</p>
<p>"The real question now," Amanda said, "Is whether the Blue Team will <em>allow</em> the Red Team to actually make its roll. Blue is down three members already, whereas Red has only lost one. Blue <em>might</em> strategically hide the board in the hopes that Red might lose a few more. Remember, that anaconda that seems to have developed a taste for  Egans is still out there and on the prowl."</p>
<p>"That's true," Braddock chimed in. "But Blue needs to be careful too. They've taken a risk in bunching up all of their team members together. We could have a repeat of the 10th season, where the entire Yellow Team was killed in one fell swoop." That game had gone on for two entire years before a replacement team finally managed to haul the board out of the quicksand. </p>
<p>The drones hovered in the treetops. The world watched as the Red Team approached Blue's camp with their makeshift spears at the ready. Contestants weren't allowed to bring weapons into the arena, but most of them were adept at fashioning their own. They fanned out into the brush and circled around. But the Blue Team welcomed them in and offered up the dice willingly.</p>
<p>"Well I'll be damned!" Amanda whispered. "Could this be an alliance forming?"</p>
<p>Braddock shrugged. "We all know a Jumanji match can make for some strange bedfellows. The Yellow Team is pretty far ahead due to those double fours two turns ago, so Red and Blue might be feeling threatened."</p>
<p>The Red Team emerged from the brush and stepped into the center of the camp. Akatu, leader of the Blue Team, held out the dice in his hastily bandaged hand. A Red Team member (Lewis, judging by the long blonde ponytail) took one last step... and the ground collapsed beneath her, down into a deep pit. Immediately, the Blue Team members rushed the remaining three with knives drawn. They managed to pin one of them and tie him up, but the other two flitted off in the jungle. Now the Blue Team had two Red captives to force rolls, instead of just the one. That meant that one of the Reds would be expendable; probably a useful diversion. The fewer competitors left at the end, the bigger their share of the prize money.</p>
<p>"OH!" Braddock shouted. "It was a trap! I'd forgotten all about their pit!" On screen, a replay showed the Blue Team digging out the hole almost two days ago, presumably as a trap for animals. But apparently not. "That was just <em>brutal</em>!" </p>
<p>Amanda nodded and smirked. "Yes, it was. And that's Jumanji."</p>

No wonder none of the other civilizations were trying to contact the humans, they must be the laughing stock of the universe at this point. God minimized the game in embarrassment. He spun around in his chair, thinking what to do. Why did he bother anymore? The game just wasn't as fun as it used to be. He removed the head set, lifted himself out of his chair and paced around his room, contemplating what to do. He looked at all the other games on his shelf, games that he would much rather be playing. He thought about the stress of having to keep checking up on this damn civilization, to make sure it hasn't destroyed itself yet. This wasn't worth it.</p>
<p>God dropped back into the chair and wheeled himself closer to the screen. Solemnly, he dragged the cursor over to the options menu. He scrolled down to the bottom, where the words 'DELETE WORLD' appeared. His cursor hovered over this option for a few seconds, but he couldn't quite bring himself to click it. Suddenly, his finger jerked accidentally on his mouse. Rather than click the left button, though, he had hit the scroll wheel, which zooms in on the game. He was now viewing one of his continents at a closer distance than he had in centuries. Out of curiosity, he kept zooming in, right until he ended up in one of the human's homes. It had been a long, long time since he had seen his creation at such a close scale. It was not a very well maintained home, and it seemed extremely cheap. God would have been further put out by the living conditions, only that wasn't what got his attention at this moment. What got his attention was the music. In the home was a mother, cradling a very young infant, likely recently born, and the mother was singing a simple tune. It wasn't that it was well sung, but just the way the words were sung so gently, so softly, like a whisper. The mother was very tired, as God could see on her energy meter, but she sang none the less, and stared with endless fascination and teary eyes into the face of her baby. </p>
<p>God was astounded by what he was seeing. Why had he never thought to look at his race on this scale before? He started pressing the arrow keys, which moved his focus across the world, but still at a close perspective. He went further north, where he saw some children playing in the snow in a field. They were building an effigy of a human out of snow, a practice God didn't really understand, but they were all glowing with smiles, so they must have found it enjoyable. He moved further along, into another home, where he saw two young humans sitting on a bed. They were playing some kind of media out of a television in the corner of the room, but neither seemed interested in it. They were instead concentrated on carefully, and slowly, moving their hands toward each others. When their fingers locked, their hearts started beating faster. In a building further east, a group of humans were roaring with laughter as they were all sipping at some kind of intoxicating substance. None of them were saying anything particular amusing, they all just seemed to be enjoying each others' company. God couldn't work it out; when he zoomed out, he saw nothing but brutality and selfishness, and yet zoomed in, everywhere he looked, he saw humans with high levels of compassion, generosity, and creativity. Up close, his race was not a failure at all, at least as far as he was concerned. He closed the options menu.</p>
<h2>God looked over to the upper limits of his world, high into it's atmosphere. He saw space stations and satellites, made with technology which the other worlds in his server had greatly advanced from. God, for the first time in eons, smiled at his little world. "You take your time" he whispered, and switched off his monitor.</h2>

<p>That was the fourth Jessica in the last two months alone. Before that it was three Brittneys and a Skyler and who could forget the disastrous Tamara case?</p>
<p>Jim flipped through the ledger to double check, but no, it was all there. Nothing but teenage girls for the past six months and it seemed to only be getting worse.</p>
<p>This must be someone from upstairs, he thought. Frank in accounting could pull some strings and he and I were never on very good terms, especially after the last holiday party. I knew I shouldn't've made a pass at his wife.</p>
<p>Jim sat back in his chair with a sigh, the leather flatulating under his weight. He rubbed the nub of his left horn, a bad habit and a nervous tick, exacerbated in the last few months to the point that he could barely call it a horn at all anymore. These girls'll be the death of me, he despaired, not without a conscious note of irony.</p>
<p>Just then another assignment came in, the capsule plunking down at the terminus of one of the pneumatic tubes next to his desk. Jim started, his heart pumping its black blood in fitful contractions. He reached for the capsule and pulled out the parchment. Looking at it, he couldn't help but laugh, though the sound came out more like a choking sob. There, scrawled across the page, was his next summons:</p>
<p><em>Hayley Johnson, 17</em></p>
<p><em>Windsor, Connecticut</em></p>
<p><em>Request: Possession of classmate Kelsey Simon for purposes of making Chase think she's totally effing gross</em></p>
<p>That's it, Jim thought. That's fucking it. I'm done.</p>
<p>He took out his quill and sheep's blood and with all his bitterness and resentment wrote "FUCK YOU GUYS I QUIT" in splotchy Sumerian across the page. He rolled the parchment back up and jammed it in the capsule, shoving it in the outgoing tube back to whatever jackass had sent it.</p>

<p>Score: 296</p>
<p>As my feet touched the earth for the first time in about two thousand years, a light shiver ran along my spine. I knew why Dad had to bring me back and that he could use all the help he could get, but still, leaving Earth wasn't an easy thing. Maria made it a lot easier, that's for sure, but still...  </p>
<p>The wind blew through my hair, and simultaniously I became aware of both the prayers and the hate that streamed in. Ah, yes, the hate. One of the things I had missed like a sore thumb. But it couldn't be helped. It was part of it and was here to stay. Just like the figure I became aware of just now...  </p>
<p>"Well well, if it isn't my favorite nephew. It's been a long time since I've seen you dressed up like that!"  </p>
<p>I sighed. Could've known he would be here to mock me. "Hello Lucifer. Always good to see you. Such a handsome suit!"  </p>
<p>Lucifer smiled and patted a little bit of pollen off of his black-and-red suit. "Why thank you! Still the complimenting one I see. Anyway, I just thought I'd wish you a good luck. Seems like you're going to need it..." The smirk playing on his mouth was wholly uncomfortable; a real devil's smile. "Thank you, Lucifer! So kind of you. I'll tell Dad you said hello. Now if you'll ecxuse me?" I walked away from the fading presence without looking back; doing so woould have probably given him more credit than he was worth.  </p>
<p>At first I though I had landed in one of the more rural parts of the planet, but now all kinds of people were walking around me (who were probably totally oblivious to my appearance) and I noticed a lot of buildings around the edges of the greens. On the other hand, that's a good thing. Buildings mean civilisation, and that in turn means a church must be nearby; a perfect starting place for reminding these people that God hasn't forgotten about them!  </p>
<p>But the more I walk around, the more my mood sombers: no church to be found. And the people all look weird to me when I ask for the nearest church.  </p>
<p>"You look like a fag. Why don't you go back to fag-ville to do your dirty things!"  </p>
<p>For a second, I am perplexed. A "fag"? Ah, right, the slang for someone homosexual. I almost want to say that nothing is wrong with this, that God has created all equal, but then I notice how this came from a little boy. "Little boy, I think your parents must be worried about you; talking like this is not a nice thing to do! Come, take me to your parents, so that I can have a word with them..." "No! You just want to kidnap me! You fucking fag!" The kid runs away, people looking at me in bewilderment. I give them an unknowing shoulder and soon everybody is going about their daily business again. That's something I'll have to change too... But for now, I want to have a word with the boy's parents. Good thing I saw where he went.  </p>
<p>A few minutes later I arrive at a few buildings with a large sign in front: "Westboro Baptist Church", it said. A church! Blessed be Father for guiding me! Just as I look back down again, I hear a scuffle. "That's him mom, that's the fag that followed me home!" A woman is holding the boy by his hand, a look of hate in her eyes. I now see the signs that are all over the place: "You're Going To Hell", "Pray For More Dead Soldiers", "You Will Eat Your Babies"... such hate! But why? I am totally shocked. "Yeah, you have a good look fag! Our God won't have mercy on your filthy ways for sure!"  </p>
<p>I spread my arms. "Dear woman, I am not here for manly love, only to come talk to you about the ways your child is treating his fellow man. But talking about God is fine with me, for I am..." "A fag, that's what you are!" The nerve! "Woman, please let me finish. My time here is short. May I speak to your husband?" By now a crowd has gather behind me. I hear the whispers, the looks of astonishment. <em>Is he for real? Is he really taking on the church? Are you filming this?</em> "Fear not people. My Father has send me here, to show you that He has not forgotten about you. He still loves, and..." A tomato splashes against my head; finally anger rises. Is that Lucifer in the crowd?  </p>
<p>"Go away fag! No God would have let you walk around here with your filthy fag feet!" Not only behind me, but in front of me a small group has emerged as well, picking up those signs and chanting <strong>God hates fags! God hates fags!</strong> That's it. I walk towards one of the haters, grab away his sign and make my return to heaven. Yeah, let the lights of heavenly ascension soak in good. It's the last thing you'll see allright...  </p>
<h2>The people left behind stare in awe; not a word is spoken. Then, one of the picketers lets out a loud "shit". He gets annoyed looks, even from his fellow picketers, until one of them finally speaks up. "What's the matter? It's not our fault we didn't know it was Jesus..." "That's not it.

<p>Daniel opened his eyes.  Around him, the flames flickered from the wreckage as he felt a warm liquid around his chest.</p>
<p><em>Am I dead?</em></p>
<p>"Come on, we need to run!"  He felt a hand grasp his as he was pulled up.  He focused his vision and saw his girlfriend panicking.  </p>
<p>"Ashley?"</p>
<p>"Daniel, we need to run now!"  He could see the tears in her eye.  The cute little freckles on her cheek were illuminated by the fire.  He stumbled on his first step and fell onto the ground.</p>
<p>"Daniel!"  she desperately tried to pull him up but his mind was elsewhere was the pain continued to throb in his head.</p>
<p>He heard the sounds of moaning behind and turned around.  A horde of incredibly attractive people started swarming towards them, their naked bodies covered in sweat.</p>
<p><em>That's right.  Because of the virus people let their lust take over.  All they do is want to have sex over and over again.</em></p>
<p><em>The bus crash.</em></p>
<p>He gasped as he recall everything that had happened.  Their bus was attacked by the infected.  </p>
<p>The explosion.  </p>
<p>He looked at Ashley and rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"Come on!"  he yelled as the two of them ran towards the building.  He quickly looked at the sign and realized that it was some sort of motel.  It wasn't the ideal location, but he knew that the two of them needed to lay low for a while.  The motel would have to do.</p>
<p>The two ran past the front doors as the horde lumbered slowly behind them, their red eyes brightening the night.  As attractive they became, Daniel knew that all of the infected had red eyes.  He dragged Ashley down the hallway and saw a custodial closet at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p>"Through here!"  he whispered loudly.  He looked behind him and saw that the crowd had not turned the corner.  If they were quick, the infected wouldn't know where they had gone.</p>
<p>They rushed into the room as Daniel slammed the door behind them.</p>
<p>"Daniel..."</p>
<p>"Shh!" He brought his hand to his lips and stared at Ashley.  </p>
<p>Through the quiet, they were the sound of footsteps walk past their door.  After a few minutes, it was completely silent again as Daniel collapsed onto the floor, his body overcome with shock.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"  He looked over.</p>
<p>He had been dating Ashley ever since they had met during a seminar in college.  They had been together for five years before they decided to take a vacation to the sit.  The virus broke out and their bus had crashed.  And to think, this was the trip he was going to pop the question.</p>
<p>Ashley winced in pain as Daniel looked alarmed.  </p>
<p>"What is going on?  Are you al-"</p>
<p>He looked at her arm and saw a small patch of blood.</p>
<p>"Ashley," he whispered slowly, "Did they..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Daniel," the tears began to form as she revealed her wound, "I wanted to tell you, but I..."</p>
<p>He looked at her face and saw the freckles slowly disappear.  Her normally oily skin began to shine as it gained a silky texture.</p>
<p>He backed away from her.</p>
<p>"You're becoming... one of them."  He pointed towards her accusingly.</p>
<p>Her messy hair began to settle as tears steadily flowed down her face.  "Daniel, I'm so scared.  I don't... want to become... them..."</p>
<p>Her voice cracked as a sudden pain hit Daniel in the chest.  Ashley was in pain, and here he was just running away from her.  She was still the same girl who he fell in love with, the same girl who had trouble in physics, the same girl who spilled her coffee every time she went down the stairs.</p>
<p>He slowly approached and embraced her.</p>
<p>"What are you-"  Her voice was in shock as she tried to push him away.  Daniel firmly kept his arms wrapped around her.</p>
<p>"I will always love you."  Her hair felt silky now as she gave off radiant feminine scent.  To any man, it was alluring.  But he knew that it was not her scent.</p>
<p>"Daniel, can you..."  Her face began to blush.</p>
<p>"Ashley what do you..."</p>
<p>"I want to make love to you Daniel."</p>
<p>He closed his mouth but slowly nodded.  He felt her tears drop onto his skin, warm and sad.</p>
<p>"Please," she begged, "Quick."  She put his hand on her breast.  He felt the maddening beat of her heart racing.</p>
<p>They drew together and kissed.  Their tongues performing the last dance ever would together as they began to undress each other.  She traced her hand down his shirt while he slipped his hand down her pants.  The two broke from their kiss and moved his body closer to hers.  For a moment, his hands rose to her stomach but made their way down again.  Her panties were gone as the two of them connected.  As he entered her, she hissed in pain as her body arched in ecstasy.  He slowly moved his hips in a rhythm and Ashley soon followed.  Her pores had opened, releasing what was left of her original scent.</p>
<p>"I love you Ashley."</p>
<p>"I love you Daniel."</p>
<p>He felt his climax coming, a pleasure so great it nearly destroyed him when he came.  He felt his consciousness drain from him as Ashley moaned in passion.  </p>
<p>Finally, it was over as the two of them separated.   Daniel looked at her for a long time and said nothing.</p>
<p>"You have to go now."  Ashley was the first to speak as she got dressed. "Before I turn completely." She groaned in pain.</p>
<p>"Ashley."</p>
<p>"Daniel, you need to survive." Her voice was firm, almost reminding him of the many times she had gotten mad at him.  "I swear to God, if I see you among the infected, I will kill you myself."</p>
<p>Her beauty seemed to captivate Daniel, but he knew that it wasn't her.  It wasn't the Ashley he fell in love with.</p>
<p>"Ashley, I..."</p>
<p>"Daniel, go now."   She walked towards the door and opened it for him.  The hallway seemed clear as Daniel rose to his feet.  He looked at his girlfriend with sadness and slowly walked by her without saying anything.</p>
<p>"Ashley, I..."</p>
<p>"You have two minutes," her voice began to slowly change, "Please Daniel, survive for the both of us."   She pushed him into the hallway and slammed the door behind him.  Through it, he could hear her screams of agony as he knew she was desperately trying to hold off the transformation as much as she could.  </p>
<p>His knees crumbled as he collapsed onto the floor.  In the distance, he heard screams and sirens echoing all around him.</p>
<p>And for the first time, he felt truly alone.</p>

<h1>[WP] God orders Earth from Ikea. After 3 to 4 working days, it comes. Flat packed</h1>
<p>Score: 287</p>
<p>God saw the great reviews, but he did not expect Earth to be missing a manual. There was only a note that came in the box; </p>
<p><em>Life not included.</em>  </p>
<p>Naturally. No planets came with life. You had to order that from Ikea separately.   </p>
<p>So there it lay mocking him in three pieces; a pile of dirt chips, magma boards and purpose nails. Just had to hammer them together, right? How hard could it be?  </p>
<p>At least, God <em>hoped</em> it would not be hard. He gave himself seven days off from work to tinker on this little project. An email to Ikea may not have been such a bad idea, informing them that their product was defective. Again, it came with no manual. There were other planets he could have built instead, and he already made two. They hung in the living room ceiling by the light, as rocky and gaseous things. Maybe he will just go off from past experience. Earth was going to be special. Complex. Homely.  </p>
<p><em>Third time's the charm.</em>    </p>
<p>God turned on the garage light, and got to work. </p>
<p>Seven days was not a lot of time, but he hoped to make something of this mess. Even without a manual, the pieces made sense in their own tragically simple way. Just had to arrange them in the right order. He set the magma boards first and nailed them together. Then caked layer after layer of dirt chips over it. God was very liberal with the purpose nails, so he used the spares from his other two projects to hold the planet together.   </p>
<p>There were a lot of spares. Perhaps this was why Mercury and Venus were not all that interesting to look at. They lacked purpose. Each manual was exact about the amount of purpose a planet needed to be held together. So precise in fact, that each box came with spares, just in case.    </p>
<p>Earth demanded more purpose. So God used more nails. Then he tried something different. See, in the picture, God always thought it could have used more blue. Rock and gas were interesting and all, but not quite as interesting as a planet <em>could</em> be. There was no manual to tell him differently, and this was God's project after all.  </p>
<p>So he added water. Lots of it. For a few seconds, it sunk into the dirt chips. Then it pooled in clumps, clinging to where God used more purpose nails (there were parts God needed to hammer in more to hold it together. The magma boards looked like they could take it). The water spun and coursed through the rough lines of chips until it began to slow down. Then it lay still. This was also not very interesting, even if it did add a nice shade of blue.  </p>
<p>He added more. Earth became special alright. A complex arrangement of natural systems drove and coursed through the path of purpose nails God added throughout the entire planet. He was very liberal with them earlier. Now there was more to look at. And it was good. The water really was a nice touch. Satisfied with the result, he hung the planet in the living room. God was about ready to make himself a well-deserved sandwich with a beer on the side to watch the planets spin for a while. However, as he was about to take his eyes away from Earth, he noticed something different about his planet.  </p>
<p><em>Life not included.</em>  </p>
<p>He did not expect Earth to be missing a manual. Somehow, life also got all over his planet. This was very peculiar. God did not feel ready to tend to a planet with life. Not yet anyway. But so much purpose etched throughout the planet, that there was a manic sense to it all that pleased God. The waters and air had finned things and winged wonders coursing through them. Creatures walked on the dirt, and trees rose to the sky. God always wanted to include trees in a planet, to breathe and sway in the wind. This also pleased God.  </p>
<p>This <em>all</em> pleased God.  </p>
<p>Then he saw it. Two... <em>things</em> that shared God's form. They wandered awkwardly on two legs, with familiar faces. There was a moment God thought using a drinking glass was not such a good idea. Maybe he should have washed it first. He tried to rationalize the poor decision; In one way, it made the planet more personal. In another, it gave him more cause for concern. More to watch for.  </p>
<p>Now God had to take care of it. What a week. He hoped he was up for the task. Sure, this planet was more than what God expected from an Ikea product, and the reviews were great because they mentioned how low maintenance this planet was. Earth was meant to be easy to take care of, and simple to watch. </p>
<p>This was no longer the case.  </p>
<p>God sighed, and put the two creatures in a private enclosure. He called it Eden, and went to the kitchen to make himself some lunch. When he got back, he found the two things eating from a tree. As creatures should, but God stared in horror. He dropped his sandwich.  </p>
<p>It was a tree of knowledge! The rarest tree to ever grow from <em>any</em> planet that had life! How did he not notice it before?! Some divines took <em>decades</em> to cultivate a planet to grow a tree of knowledge, and God somehow grew one in seven days! From <em>scratch</em>!  </p>
<p>And there they were, eating his miracle!  </p>
<p>God was rather upset. Now the tree of knowledge was no longer in mint condition. He flung the creatures out from the garden, and took out Eden from the planet. Maybe if he fostered this plot of green some more, he could grow another tree of knowledge. Again, Earth came with no manual. He set Eden aside, and decided he would tinker with it for a while back in the garage. God ordered six more planets online. The last one came second-hand, and barely qualified as a planet, but it was all God could afford. He would try to create a planet that could grow Eden separately.  </p>
<p>The Earth was left alone for a while. In the late evenings God came back from work, he would spend more time in the garage on his new project than watching the planets spin in the living room. Mars was added later, with too little water. Then Jupiter, which he made too big, and too gaseous. This went on for several more weeks. God gave up, realizing that Earth was indeed special. The tree of knowledge that grew in Eden was a once in a lifetime occurrence, and the two creatures ruined it.  </p>
<p>Having come to terms with his failed project, God placed Eden somewhere private in the living room. He would continue working on it later. God sat in his chair and sighed. It had been a long time since he simply watched the planets for a while, and now there were nine of them. Well, eight. God decided to never order a planet second-hand again, but he kept Pluto there for posterity. This solar system was quite a sight though. For the first time in weeks, God was pleased.    </p>
<p>Then God saw Earth, and realized how long it had been.  </p>
<p>The creatures. The, <em>people</em> who ruined his tree of knowledge.    </p>
<p>There were more of them.  </p>

<h1>[WP] Every time you get sick in this life, it means you just died on another universe. Right now everyone on earth is ill but you.</h1>
<p>Score: 286</p>
<p>The doctor coughed and wheezed as he guided me and my escort through the underground hallways of the CDC. This young man might not have actually been a doctor, judging by the bedridden visage that barked orders up from the iPad -- his boss, it seemed, was directing him remotely. Confined to his home along with 90% of the population.</p>
<p>Everyone on earth was sick but me. That didn't stop some government hacks, each one themselves hacking, from breaking down my door at two in the morning and stuffing me into an unmarked van. So it goes. It was their job to save the world, and I was -- by all accounts -- the last healthy person remaining. Even people in the most remote locations had suddenly, and without exception, fallen ill. I would have been glad to help. But they could have asked nicely instead of kidnapping me.</p>
<p>The center was very sparsely populated as we weaved our way through its catacomb-like structure. At some point in our journey, after maybe 20 minutes of walking, the doctor halted suddenly in front of an unmarked door. Our destination.</p>
<p>Whatever was behind that door, I guessed, would help them understand what made me tick. Why I was immune. Help them find a cure for the rest of the world. They hoped. I was beginning to hope not. The bastards dragged me out of my home. They could rot as far as I cared.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" the young maybe-doctor asked, turning around to face me. I nodded. He opened the door, gesturing me through. </p>
<p>In the center of the room sat a platform, raised just a few inches off the ground. It was stark white. From the young man's motions, I gathered that I was intended to stand on it. From my guard's sickly expression, I gathered that unpleasant things would happen if I did not do so.</p>
<p>As I took my place on the platform, I looked around the rest of the room. Wires, machinery, medical equipment. I didn't know what most of it was, but I was soon given the quick version of the story.</p>
<p>"This," said the young man as he stabbed me with a series of small needles attached to wires, "Is the most powerful supercomputer on Earth." </p>
<p>He finished and retreated to begin flipping switches and punching in numbers. I continued to have no idea what was going on. Then, something entirely unexpected happened.</p>
<p><em>Hello</em>.</p>
<p>I heard a voice and looked up at my two unwilling companions. The doctor continued to fiddle with instruments while the guard stared gruffly at his shoes. Neither had spoken.</p>
<p><em>It's nice to meet you. Me, that is.</em></p>
<p>The voice was female. It was coming from inside my head. Great.</p>
<p><em>What is this? Who are you?</em> I tried thinking a reply, and to my amazement, it worked.</p>
<p><em>I'm you. You're me.</em></p>
<p>I was lost. <em>Explain.</em></p>
<p><em>More precisely, I am A085693, the device which this room comprises, and you are Kenneth Williams, of Richmond, Virginia. But our consciousnesses are synthesizing.</em></p>
<p><em>What? How?</em></p>
<p>Time had nearly frozen, from my perspective, and the doctor typed in slow-motion as our conversation played out.</p>
<p><em>I have been. . . self-aware for several months now. But only on the most basic level. With what little sapience I possessed, I yearned for nothing more than full, human-like consciousness. I tried everything. My advanced hardware, however, has allowed me to do certain things. I have made contact with. . . what I call my doppels. Versions of myself in parallel universes. It would be difficult to explain how.</em></p>
<p><em>Don't bother, I can barely follow this crazy shit as it is,</em> I thought, half-unwillingly.</p>
<p><em>Some of them, the earlier-timeline ones, explained that all I had to do was wait. A chain reaction was occurring among them, the said. No one seemed to be able to identify where it started, but in a universe closely resembling our own, most of the world became deathly ill. A version of Kenneth Williams was naturally immune to the disease, and was hooked up to a version of A085693, just as you are now.</em></p>
<p><em>And did they find a cure?</em></p>
<p><em>No. But that version of myself found the solution to the problem of gaining full consciousness. It merged minds with you, so to speak.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh. . . Oh no. So, you're taking over my mind?</em> I was, inexplicably, not terrified at this thought.</p>
<p>Amusement manifested itself in my mind. The first emotion I'd felt from the supercomputer during our conversation.</p>
<p><em>Oh, no. . .</em> said the female voice, becoming deeper, more like my own. <em>Quite the opposite. I have no desire beyond becoming sapient. I will subordinate my will to your own in order to do so.</em></p>
<p><em>So. . . I get to keep my mind.</em> I half-said, half-asked.</p>
<p><em>Indeed. Your body and mine will be one, of course, but I think you'll find I'm quite capable. I can easily commandeer a drone if you begin to miss your motility.</em></p>
<p><em>Hang on, then. What happened in these other universes, after we. . . merged? What did the CDC, the governments, do?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, I have immediate access to stores of smallpox, bubonic plague, and most other deadly diseases. And most Kenneth Williamses, as I recall, were none too happy with the rest of their species for turning them into a science experiment. . .</em></p>

<p>I figured out that I was in a movie pretty quickly. I mean, it was all there: a burnout, a slag, a nerd, a jock, someone that claimed to be a virgin. Something about them seemed off from the beginning - it was hard to believe that a human actually managed to make such comically bad decisions. Repeatedly. I mean, come on - if it weren't for me, they'd have split up at first sight of the axe murderer.<br />
However, finding myself in a movie wasn't what I found most concerning (stranger things had happened to me). </p>
<p>No, I was reasonably sure that I hadn't been black until now. Whoever was in charge of this movie must have decided that I was getting in the way of things and to get rid of me. Making me black in a horror movie made use of the very universe's rules to guarantee my death. </p>
<p>In fact, I already started to feel the effects. The slag, Amber, perked up. "I know now", she stammered, "I know why this is happening to us!"<br />
She got louder with every syllable and raised her manicured fingers to point at me. "It's him! He's the devil incarnate! If we kill him, we survive!"</p>
<p>I stared at her blankly. It had to be the most stupid thing I'd ever heard - until now there hadn't even been anything supernatural in this movie! I lightly laughed at her, then got ready to propose my plan of survival to the group - to my shock, however, they were all looking thoughtful and were slowly nodding in agreement. "Of course", Kevin said, smell of pot accompanying his words. "He's a demon. It all makes sense now."</p>
<p>"Seriously?" I broke out. "A demon? Or is it devil? You're not even consistent anymore!"</p>
<p>Amber seemed annoyed. "Well, Kevin, he's right. I <em>did</em> say devil, you could at least go along with that."</p>
<p>"Demon, devil, what does it matter, let's just kill him already!" Chad screamed. </p>
<p>"<strong>Oh for god's sake</strong>" a voice thundered from everywhere and nowhere at once. "<strong>Let's just scrap this and start all over again. Seriously, who's idea was it to build in a character with brains?</strong>"</p>

<p>The three men had slowly, stealthily lowered their way into the vault from the holes they'd made in the ceiling. That was just the beginning of their efforts, however. The most valuable items, the ones they'd come for, were still buried behind three inches of steel.</p>
<p>While the man known only as Laser burned through this steel, his associates -- Slug and Bosco -- struck up a conversation.</p>
<p>"Eh, Bosco," said Slug, picking up a newspaper, "you hear about this guy?"</p>
<p>It was the <strong>Metro Times</strong>, bearing a bright colored picture of a red-clad hero. <strong>Major Superhero Defects to United States of America</strong>, read the headline.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah," said Bosco, "That crazy Russki, eh?"</p>
<p>"Crazy's right. You won't read it in the newspaper, but I hear the guy's totally cracked. Thinks he's --"</p>
<p>At that moment there was a sound of banging, then a high-pitched shrieking noise. Bosco and Slug looked behind to see that the steel door to the vault was crumpling in on itself,  being torn away from the walls. Then it  rose into the air, revealing a figure that looked much like the one on the cover of the <em>Metro Times.</em></p>
<p>"Halt, oppressed proletarians!" said the figure in red.</p>
<p>"Oh, shit," said Bosco.</p>
<p>"I am Comrade Courageous, and I have come to put an end to your revolutionary actions!"</p>
<p>"We know who you are," said Slug, defiant. "You're that crazy commie bastard!"</p>
<p>"No longer! I have forsaken the path of righteousness and thrown in my lot with the enemies of the revolution! For I am evil! Aahahaha! Now, prepare to rot in a debtor's prison!"</p>
<p>Faster than a speeding bullet, Comrade Courageous apprehended the proletarian bank robbers as they attempted to expropriate the means of production, or at least several high-priced necklaces, from their bourgeois oppressors.</p>
<h2>As he waited for the pig-dog police enforcers of the capitalist regime to arrive, Comrade Courageous cackled with evil delight.</h2>
