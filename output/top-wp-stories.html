<p>Greetings, faggots:</p>
<p>My name is xXSwaGGy-Quarlax [FaZe], Interplanetary Diplomat for the Andromeda Galaxy. I would like to begin this message by assuring you that I am not a camping faggot, nor will my people attempt to quick scope you. Although we have amassed many 360 no scopes throughout our collective lives, we come with a message of peace. I hope to make clear that this is a knife-only match and we will not be attempting any faggotry, nor will we feed mid. We wish only to share our swag amongst your people, you fucking aim botting hackers. </p>
<p>My clan and I have traveled many millions of light years in search of sentient life, visiting thousands of planets in an attempt to make contact and find the dankest kush. While we have been forced to pwn many noobs and fuck countless mothers on several of those worlds, reking their shit harder than a Haitian Earthquake, we only did so out of self-preservation. None of those planets held any life beyond the hostile and untamable, nor any blunts to blaze upon. It was truly us against them; however, we wish to make it clear that we do have blood on our hands. We, as an intergalactic species, understand that trust is founded upon honesty, and thus tell you retard hackers of our former faggotry. That said, we assure you that your obese, apartment dwelling neckbeards will stand safely beside us and shall never be shrekt.</p>
<p>We first located your planet nearly six Earth years ago and have been monitoring your communication devices, which you call “X-Box,” to learn your jargon and construct our message of peace. We hope that you understand our dialect and not see us as pay 2 win feeders. In order to further express our good faith, we have amassed a large collection of Code Red Mountain Dew and Cool Ranch Doritos, which we would like to share with your MLG pros. We hope you accept our offering in peace, and that you not fuck our mothers. We wish only to become allies with you, the faggot tryhards of Earth. </p>
<p>Please find us waiting for you at your trailer park tomorrow at sunrise. We will be in the large flying aircraft, which should be just a few pounds lighter than that of your mother's left tit.</p>

<h1>[WP] A wife kills her husband. Make me sympathize with both characters.</h1>
<p>Score: 6090</p>
<p>He was drunker than usual.  Ordinarily, she would feel relief when he collapsed onto the couch by the TV.  That meant he was too drunk to yell and fight.  Tonight, she felt no relief.  All she could do was watch him from the doorway, hoping he would drink the poisoned whiskey she had just poured him.</p>
<p>A lump sat in her throat as she watched his fat belly rise and fall with his labored breath.  In his hand, he held the last drink she would ever pour for him.  He sat there for a few minutes in silence without even looking at the glass of whiskey he clutched in his fat fingers.  Then, without warning, he downed the entire glass in one movement.</p>
<p>He let the glass hit the ground and sighed.  He would go to sleep soon.  It wouldn’t be painful.  Nowhere near as painful as the last twenty-three years had been for her.  She wanted him to leave the world peacefully.  She still loved him, after all.  Still, she felt he deserved an explanation.  At the very least, he deserved a good-bye.</p>
<p>She walked around to the front of the couch.  He rolled his half-opened eyes in her direction and the two stared at each other in silence.</p>
<p>“There was more than whiskey in your drink,” she said, her voice shaking.  “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Your black eye is healing,” he said quietly.  “You know I’m sorry about hurting you.  Don’t you?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“You were very beautiful once.  I can still see it sometimes.  When you smile.  You don’t smile much these days.  But when you do, your eyes flash like they did when we were teenagers.  It reminds me of how young and beautiful we were.  Young, beautiful, and carefree.”</p>
<p>“Your drink,” she said with tears forming in her eyes.  “You’re dying.  I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>“I know,” he whispered and slowly nodded.  “I saw you pour it.”</p>
<p>She put her hands over her mouth and tried not to cry.</p>
<p>“Do you remember that field trip we took during our second year of high school?” he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“We spent the whole day together,” he said as his voice became fainter.  “It was the first time I really met you.  There were fifty or sixty of us there but I only cared about you.  On the bus ride home, we sat next to each other.  Do you remember now?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“Everybody on the bus slept.  They were so tired.  But not us.  We couldn’t stop talking to each other.  We had so much to say back then.  When you started to drift off to sleep, I was sad.  But then you said something to me.  Do you remember what it was?”</p>
<p>“I-” she paused to steady her voice.  “I’m going to lean on you, ok?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said as a smile slowly spread across his face.  “And you fell asleep on my shoulder.  I couldn’t sleep the whole bus ride because I was so happy that we were having that moment.  And I know you didn’t sleep either.  The bus bounced too much.  And back then my arms were muscular.  You just wanted to be close to me.  I’m sorry I was such a lousy pillow.  And I’m sorry I was an even lousier husband.”</p>
<p>She wanted to say something but could not.</p>
<p>His voice slowed even further.  He spoke as if he was in a dream.  “I still love you as much as I did on that bus ride.  I just got worse at showing it.  I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>She did not reply.  She just stood and tried to compose herself.  After a moment, she walked over and sat next to him on the couch.  </p>
<p>“I’m going to lean on you, ok?” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Ok,” he replied as she rested her head against his arm.</p>
<p>The two sat in silence until his breathing stopped at last.</p>

<h1>[WP] You are a teenager with the ability to measure how "Dangerous" people are on a scale from 1 to 10 just by looking at them. A normal child would be a 1, while a trained man with an assault rifle might be a 7. Today, you notice the unassuming new kid at school measures a 10.</h1>
<p>Score: 5579</p>
<p>I was fourteen when it all started. I'd been out one day, waiting for some friends at the park, as you do. I was eating a chocolate bar and apathetically tossed the wrapper aside. An old lady approached me. </p>
<p>"Don't you have any respect? Pick that up."</p>
<p>Naturally I ignored her, being the lovely young man that I was until she screamed.</p>
<p>"Fine! Have it your way! If you shall litter the Earth, then I shall litter your mind."</p>
<p>She promptly left and I was confused, I assumed she was just a bit of an old bat. The wrapper blew away, and my friends turned up. We played some football, I was always fairly horrendous at that. </p>
<p>The next day, I woke up. For some reason the first thing I thought of was the old lady. I realised that it was fairly obnoxious for me to act that way to someone. Ah well, I'll probably never see her again anyway. I went downstairs and greeted my mother who has been a bit of a struggling single for a while now (I guess having an obnoxious teenage brat doesn't help much). There was a two, hovering above her head; cyan in colour. I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time. I knew that, objectively, this was strange. Intuitively, however, it felt oddly natural. So I went about my day.</p>
<p>As I went through school that day, I noticed everybody had the numbers. Notably my friend Tim who was a brown belt in karate had a blue four, our loud ex-military teacher who enjoyed startling sleeping students was a yellow six. The school bully was a turquoise three. Most students were a one or a two; shades of green. I could never see a number above my own head in reflections or anything like that, much to my frustration. </p>
<p>When I watched TV I noticed that powerful people tended to have quite high numbers. The anchor had a five, the prime minister had a nine, some footage of an army doing a parade seemed to show a range from six to eight (a vibrant red).</p>
<p>Eventually, after having thought about this for a few weeks, I concluded that the number corresponded to danger. Being dangerous can mean many things. It can mean you're potent in a fight, or it can mean you have a lot of say socially. </p>
<p>One day, I was sitting in the park with my mother and some of her friends on a day out. She introduced me to someone new. Short, goatee, slicked back hair and an eight. He sat there, casually sipping on a can of lager. My mum introduced him as Sean, "my new boyfriend."</p>
<p>"WHAT?!"</p>
<p>So I couldn't control that little outburst, I must admit I panicked a bit. An eight is a member of the cabinet, a soldier, a serial murderer (What? The numbers come up on Crimewatch as well, you know). </p>
<p>He interjected, "Haha! Relax kid. I'm going to be around for a while" </p>
<p>At which point he leaned in and kissed my mum. This was not affection; this was dominance.</p>
<p>In the following days, I took my mum aside repeatedly to try to convince her to get out of this. She was, how can I put it? Thoroughly unwilling. So now I was anxious, I was frustrated. We were around Sean's house at the time. He came in later that day, bringing home some shopping, he bought me a chocolate bar. Well, that was nice? Thanks.</p>
<p>So it started out nicely enough. He could tell that I was anxious, and so he'd buy me little things to try to win my affections. To be honest, it started to work. My mum was in love with him and despite the red flags, I was honestly settling to the arrangement. What I hadn't noticed were the little things. At first it began as complaints; "the jam isn't in the cupboard I said to put it in", "clean up that fucking cat shit". Benign, but said with a sharp tongue.</p>
<p>Eventually he offered to fully support my mother. I'm not really sure how he was able to do this as he didn't have a job of which to speak, but it seemed to work out. My mum quit her job at the supermarket and now had much more free time to... "do those fucking dishes," to "make a doctor's appointment for me". He spoke repeatedly of their sex life to me. Thanks for telling me. Over time his demands were shouting.</p>
<p>Mum's number dropped from a two to a one. Something was wrong.</p>
<p>This kind of behaviour carried on for a year. I was the frog in the pot.</p>
<p>Eventually he started doing things; hitting her when I wasn't around. I didn't notice of course, although I started to pick up the signs. Then one day I did. They had a huge argument. They were shouting, things were thrown. They wouldn't stop. The walls closed in. I had nowhere to go. In my right conscience, I had nowhere I could go. I was just as frightened as she was until that is I heard a crack; he headbutted her. Blood poured forth. I freaked the fuck out. I started screaming. I started crying. I had no idea what way was up. I briefly ran into the bathroom to try  to collect myself and figure out what the fuck I was supposed to do. I was scared. I was shaking. I was angry. I was livid. I was FURIOUS. And through the tears I saw the stained bathroom mirror. Everything was blurry but I saw it right there. Black as night, floating right above my own head. I could finally see it: Ten.</p>
<p>"Fuck them, fuck him, fuck everyone. Fuck this abusive piece of shit. I am taking control of this situation." </p>
<p>In that very briefly lucid state, I called an ambulance.</p>
<p>I then broke the mirror, threw it at the ground. I picked the the largest shard of glass and looked at myself again. Ten. Definitely ten.</p>
<p>I called down. "Sean! Let's fucking talk!"</p>

<h1>[WP] You are legally allowed to commit murder once, but you must fill out the proper paperwork and your proposed victim will be notified of your intentions</h1>
<p>Score: 4939</p>
<p>I thought I'd get there early, beat the lines.  The Department of Legal Homicide opened at 9am.  9am was a foreign concept to me.  Sometimes, in my insomniac's stupor, as dusk turned to deep, purple night and then back to rosy dawn, I'd imagine people waking up, making coffee, reading the paper, sitting down to toast.  A life like that might as well have been on another planet.  But still, I found myself getting into my car at half past eight, groggy, yes, but thrilled, invigorated with the light of the morning sun and the thought of death.</p>
<p>I pulled into the DLH parking lot at 8:50.  The line was already halfway down the block.  I knew that the program, since being put to a vote and passed late last year, was popular, but I still wasn't expecting this.  I also wasn't expecting the sort of people I saw standing there, on a bright morning, hungry for blood.  I'd expected dark souls, vagabonds, transients with tattooed knuckles and stringy black hair.  But there were put together young men, in button-down shirts and khakis.  There were old men, grey hair, stooped, in dingy corduroys, who looked like their years of bloodlust should have been well behind them.</p>
<p>And then there were the women.  Young, beautiful women with golden hair and perfect skin, buzzing with life.  And old, matronly women with deep creases on their faces, the kind you'd expect to make amazing soup from an ancient, secret recipe.  The kind that has taught half the world's daughters how to love, and hate.  And there I was, at the DLH, like a child getting his first driver's permit: scared, ecstatic, and relieved.  I was so close.</p>
<p>Once inside, the line shortened.  At the front of the queue was a single desk, with a single uniformed employee sitting behind it.  They asked for my I.D., and handed me a form on a clipboard.  She also gave me a number.  "They'll call you shortly.  Please have the paperwork filled out by the time you're called, or you will forfeit your place in line."</p>
<p>With that, I took a seat on a hard, plastic chair.  The form was straightforward: My name and address, my intended victim's name and address, and a place to sign on the bottom.  That was all.  No reason for killing, no place to list my grievances, nothing.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an eternity, my number was called.  The agent in charge of my case looked over my paperwork, signed their name next to mine and stamped the form with a huge, heavy stamp that exuded importance.</p>
<p>"You're all set," they said.</p>
<p>"That's it?"</p>
<p>"That's it."</p>
<p>"And, they'll know it's happening?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we will notify them for you."</p>
<p>"How do you do it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"They'll get a certified letter.  Do they know to expect it?"</p>
<p>"They do, yes."</p>
<p>"Good," the agent replied, "That makes things easier."</p>
<p>"Have you seen a case like this before?" I asked.  I didn't know why I was prolonging the conversation, but there was something comforting about the agent's stark, bureaucratic formality.</p>
<p>"Yes.  It's quite common, actually.  We have a whole file set aside for patricide." </p>
<p>With that, a wave of relief swept over me.  There were others.  Many others, waking up early, making toast, reading the newspaper.  Others, living their entire, normal lives, waiting for the moment, the exact perfect moment, to kill their fathers.</p>
<p>I took my paperwork and left.  I was full of life, leaving the DLH with an exuberance I hadn't felt in years.  I don't remember a single thing about the drive to my father's house.  I could have run every red light without knowing it.  It wasn't until I pulled into his driveway that the gravity of the situation hit me.  That this was finally happening.</p>
<p>I've never lost the key to his house, and pulling it out on his front porch, I was overcome with a sense of nostalgia.  This key, this tool of entry from one world to another: a secret you share with only those you love and trust.  This was one of the last times I'd be using it.  Just one more tie to sever.  It fit easily in the lock.</p>
<p>I walked through the living room.  None of the lights were on.  I could already smell death in this house, he'd been dragging his fetid robes across the tattered carpets for months already. Waiting, like I'd waited, impatiently, hungrily.</p>
<p>I turned into his bedroom.  There he was, in his grey room, on his grey bed, the mattress bowed in the middle like a hammock.  It was quiet, except for the repeated, mechanical hiss and whirr of the ventilator.  I sat next to him, looked into his cloudy blue eyes.  I thought, for a second, he recognized me, but I could never be sure anymore.  I kissed him lightly on the forehead.  I said "I love you."  Then I unplugged the machine.</p>
<p>Walking out, into the bright light of day, I saw a pair of morning doves on a telephone wire.  I heard a dog bark.  I saw cars coming and going in their busy ways.  I felt everything.  I took it all in.  And it was fine. </p>

<p>Edit2: I woke up to an inbox full of nice things. Thank you!</p>

<h1>[WP] Wikipedia is shut down and all copies deleted for lack of funds and loss of net neutrality. This is the founder's "I warned you, jerks" notification.</h1>
<p>Score: 4801</p>
<p>Dear Wikipedia Readers: We’ll get right to it. We’ve never asked for much, maybe a few dollars here and there—to be honest, we've averaged maybe $15 in donations. That’s it. Did you know that 99% of other charities average $15,000 <em>per day</em>? Probably not, because we made that statistic up. Do you know why we made it up? We’re pretty sure you know why we made that up. </p>
<p>We want to make it abundantly clear that we at Wikipedia tried our best to keep our website a non-profit. For over a decade, we’ve run and maintained the largest free encyclopedia in existence, never once portraying so much as a single advertisement on any of our millions of pages. Do you remember the days of Encyclopedia Britannica, where you’d need to hire several burly, Swedish bodybuilders to lug half the compilation to your Psychology 101 class, just so that you could understand who the hell Sigmund Freud was? Probably not, because that was almost a hundred years ago. Is that date completely and utterly made up? Absolutely, but you know why. However, if for some reason you haven’t caught on yet, keep reading.</p>
<p>Here at Wikipedia, we, the editors, made our requests simple and clear: we just needed $3 from some of our visitors once every few years. That’s it. Three dollars. With that, we could’ve kept running for decades. Yet a total of fourteen of you donated this year, giving us a result of $74.32 raised (and to the jerk who sent 32 cents, thanks for costing us money to receive your donation). Do you know how much you spend on Starbucks every week? $27. You spend twenty-seven dollars on Starbucks. Every. Single. Week. Is that statistic made up? Yes. Do you know why it’s made up? We’re positive you do.</p>
<p>As many of you are aware, Net Neutrality was struck down this year, resulting in heavily increased costs for Wikipedia to maintain its servers and remain equally accessible to all Internet Service Providers. As such, we at Wikipedia were met with a difficult choice: either we could put a few banner advertisements on the website, which would net us millions—if not billions—of dollars, but sacrifice our integrity and the reliability of our content; or we could depend on you, our trusted, loyal visitors, to donate less than a tenth of your weekly paycheck. As we had such blind faith in our beloved users, we decided to decline all advertisement offers and move forward with our previous plan of funding: donations. After all, we’ve always survived on the measly funds gained by you, our greedy, selfish users. </p>
<p>In order to continue functioning as a company, we at Wikipedia, a non-profit library of endless information, needed to raise a total of $3,000,000. We raised $74.32. Seventy-four thirty-two. The average 14 year old child makes twice that in a single day of basketball. Is that fact actually a completely made up statement? It absolutely, positively is. Yet here’s the issue: due to the fact that none of you donated more than what a hypothetical, athletic child earns, Wikipedia has officially closed its doors as a non-profit as of December 10th, 2014. You can no longer trust statistics that were once reliably provided by us through our pages. That’s right, we’re done, out, closed. It’s over.</p>
<p>“But Wikipedia, I’m on your site right now. I’m reading this notice on your website this very moment.” Great observation, Captain. You are a very astute learner. You are most certainly on Wikipedia right now. Yet you might notice something a bit strange about it. For example, have you taken note of the fact that every single page now incorporates references to Comcast and their excellent products, and those that don’t simply redirect to Comcast’s Wikipedia page (heavily edited by their glorious lawyers)? Why don’t you go ahead and search the word “Cats.” Do it, we’ll wait. </p>
<p>Have you searched it yet? Great. Did you know that the average feline prefers Comcast’s XFINITY^® to Verizon? Of course they do, it’s just a better product all around—Wikipedia clearly explains that. How about the fact that the most common cat in the United States is the XFINITY Triple Play™? “That doesn’t make any sense” you say? Well, according to Wikipedia-Comcast^® it most certainly does. </p>
<p>We here at Wikipedia-Comcast^® are proud to announce our long-awaited merger with Comcast, allowing us to become a publicly traded company and fully incorporate their great line of products and services into any and all encyclopedia entries. Reading a great excerpt on Shakespeare’s beloved tragedy <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>? You may just be lucky enough to find a fantastic coupon to save 10% on your already low monthly Comcast bill. Checking out the results from the 1972 World Series? Whoa—a free month of HBO on Comcast’s renowned television services! Of course, this also means that all Wikipedia pages are no longer editable. Our lawyers also want us to mention that all Wikipedia pages have been stripped of citations that have not approved by Comcast and that all entries should no longer be taken as fact, although they certainly will be chock-full of money saving offers from Comcast. </p>
<p>Wikipedia-Comcast^® would like to thank you for the decades of experiences you, our loyal, devoted fans, have granted us. For more than half of our average user’s life, we have stood by you, supported you through your education, allowed you to plagiarize your way through college and beyond. We are eternally grateful for the opportunity to have assisted you, and would like to conclude our farewell on a very simple, basic note. For a limited time, sign up for Comcast’s XFINITY Triple Play™ using the code “Wikipedia” to automatically be updated to the “HD Preferred” package, a $199/month value for just $189/month. </p>

<p>We sat in the living room, me, perched in the middle of the colossal green couch, my father, in the beaten-tan lazyboy. I wan't sure where to begin. My father, though, beat me to it.</p>
<p>“<em>Hrm</em>. Well, son, you might have noticed that you have certain…<em>qualities</em> that other boys your age don’t have…”</p>

<p>I thought about Greg, how I’d misunderstood his pranks as affection. How he’d reacted, and the pain of rejection. How Michael had seen and accepted me, and how Laura saw to it that I was kicked off of the Homecoming Council.</p>
<p>“In the days to come, you might find it easier to not tell anyone what you really are. If you do decide that, I want you to know that no one can judge you. You will have every right to live your life <em>how you want to</em>, without regard for people like <em>them</em>, or even people <em>like me.</em>. But’ I hope you’ll find a few people to share this with. It helps. And I want you to know, however you choose to live your life, your mother and me will love you, <em>always.</em>”</p>
<p>My eyes started to water, cutting through the heat of shame.</p>
<p>“Also, there are going to be people who might want to hurt you because of what you are. And there will probably be people who will… <em>want things</em> from you, too. I know you’re strong, but if you ever need it, come to us for help.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Right, ok! I have to admit, I’m surprised you worked all this out for yourself already! It took me forever to awaken!”</p>
<p>“<em>Ughhh</em>, DAD.”</p>
<p>“What? I’m just proud of my boy!”</p>
<p>“That’s weird, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Nothing weird about it! It’s who you are! So, have you already experimented a bit?”</p>
<p>I thought of Mike, and the smell of his leather jacket.</p>
<p>“A little, yeah.”</p>
<p>“Right, ok. Well, you’ve probably worked out that you’ll do best with <em>rods</em>-“</p>
<p>“<em>Dad.</em>”</p>
<p>“-Staffs, staves-“</p>
<p>“<em>DAD.</em>”</p>
<p>“-even <em>wands</em>, if the situation calls for it-“</p>
<p>“<em>OH MY GOD</em>, <strong>DAD!</strong>”</p>
<p>“But you’ll figure out pretty soon that you can even use <em>just your hands</em> if you don’t have anything else to work with-.“</p>
<p>My flush of embarrassment had gone <em>nuclear</em>.</p>
<p>“JESUS SHIT, DAD! I <em>know</em>!”</p>
<p>“You do?! Wow, you’re <em>very advanced</em> for your age! I didn’t even gain mastery over the tongues of men until I was 19!”</p>
<p><em>…I was going to burn my way to the center of the Earth.</em> </p>
<p>I would. I would melt a hole, <em>seven thousand miles straight down</em>, and live there forever. That would be my home; far, <em>far</em> away from this conversation.</p>
<p>“Daaad, could you… please… not…”</p>
<p>“<em>OH!</em> I’m sorry. I’m embarrassing you. I’m just <em>so proud</em>.”</p>
<p><em>This is worse. This is worse than disowning.</em> </p>
<p>“And the good news is, this means we can have the ceremony sooner than we expected!”</p>
<p><em>WHAT.</em></p>
<p>“What ceremony?!”</p>
<p>“Your unveiling! It makes it all official, amongst us in the ‘underworld.’ “</p>
<p>“There’s a <em>ceremony</em> for that?!”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! It’s very important! We show proof of your nature to your <em>peers</em>, so you’ll be accorded full status!”</p>
<p>“…<em>What kind of proof.</em>”</p>
<p>“Oh, you know, a few <em>minor acts.</em> A practical demonstration. Don’t worry, the audience is very supportive. You might even recognize a few of them from school! Mike will be there, you know. He’s secretly a bear-man. He <em>really impressed</em> at his unveiling last year.”</p>
<p>My brain shut down.</p>
<p>“And then, after that, I’ll take out the family <em>crown and scepter</em>-“</p>
<p>I could only listen on, in mounting horror.</p>
<p>“-declaring you the true, last heir of the <em>King of the Fairies!</em>”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>My soul left my body. I saw a bright light.</p>
<p>“And then you can begin pursuing your destiny, protecting the land of Eld from monsters!”</p>
<p>I whiplashed back into the real world. “Wait. What about… what?!”</p>
<p>“You’ll really knock ‘em <em>dead</em>, son! Damn, but I’m <em>excited!</em> I’m gonna go get my robe right now!”</p>
<p>He flitted out of the room on a pair of iridescent, gossamer wings.</p>

<h1>[WP] New arrivals in eternal Hell may choose either of the following: a small wooden spoon, or a 100-trillion year vacation in Heaven.</h1>
<p>Score: 4245</p>
<p>"So it's meant to be, what, an agonizing choice? A huge dilemma? A source of eternal regret?" Leems asked. After an eternity on Acid Mine Supervision, he had finally been promoted to Reception, and wanted to be sure he understood what was going on.</p>
<p>"For some of them, yes. I think you might be overestimating how many actually think things through," Ebnerzaz replied, in his British basso. The supervisor of Reception stood an impressive twelve feet tall, and Leems had to scurry quickly in front of him to avoid his trashcan-lid-sized cloven hooves. Some said he had been chosen because the arriving souls often mistook him for the Prince of Darkness Himself.</p>
<p>"Ah, so you're saying that most of them choose the aeons-long vacation with The Enemy then," Leems wheezed. "They don't even give it a second thought, eh? 'Why would I pick a spoon when I can spend a hundred trillion years in heaven?'"</p>
<p>"Precisely," Ebnerzaz said, as they exited the vast hallway into a much vaster cavern. Its impressive collection of stalactites was sheathed in a constantly-churning haze, the better to frustrate anyone trying to enjoy the scenery. Management thought of everything.</p>
<p>"So what's our angle, then? If they get such pleasure from the vacation..."</p>
<p>"It makes it all the more crushing when they come back and realize that it was quite literally nothing compared to the length of time they'll be spending here. All subsequent torment is therefore enriched. Set the papers down there, if you would," Ebnerzaz said, as he found his desk. Leems stood on tiptoe to deposit the loose sheath of parchment in the supervisor's In box.</p>
<p>"Aha, so the correct choice, then, is the spoon?" he asked, looking around for his own desk.</p>
<p>The senior devil gave a condescending grin. "This is Hell, Leems. There is no correct choice."</p>
<p>"But..." Leems began.</p>
<p>"Our shift is starting. I'll answer any further questions when we have our break. Off you go," Ebnerzaz said, his massive clawed hand steering Leems' shoulders towards the empty desk he would be working at.</p>
<p>Leems hurried over to the protruding stone just in time for the flow of souls to shamble up to him, all of them shaved bald and clothed in itchy rags. "Welcome to Hell! You may have one amenity - a hundred trillion year vacation in heaven, starting right now, or a small wooden spoon." He offered the choice to each one of them, and saw that Ebnerzaz's assessment was even truer than he'd thought - thousands upon thousands chose the Heavenly vacation, no questions asked. As soon as they did, they vanished in a puff of light, leaving a lavender scent that clashed horribly with the dominant smell of brimstone.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the souls stopped long enough to think through the choice, his dark brow furrowing in concentration. "If you're offering me this, that means it's reasonable to choose the spoon, right? They're on a par with each other, right?" he said slowly.</p>
<p>Leems just smiled, not knowing the answer himself.</p>
<p>"So I know everybody in front of me chose Heaven. That can't be what you want. So let me think. It's eternal down here, right? So no matter how long the vacation is, it's not even a drop in the bucket. So let's think about it utilitarian-like. I can get real happy for a tiny amount of time, big-picture. Or I can choose the spoon, and it'll make me just a tiny bit happy, but for an infinite amount of time. Right?" he said eagerly. Once again, Leems didn't respond. "Oh, and what's more, once the vacation's over, I bet I'll regret I didn't choose the spoon. That'll make me even more unhappy. I'll never know what I'm missing out on if I don't go to heaven! But the spoon... that'll last me forever. No regrets there!"</p>
<p>"Are you quite done?" Leems asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah. I'm done. I'm pickin' the spoon," the soul said triumphantly.</p>
<p>Leems nodded, and pulled open the stone drawer in his desk with a scraping sound. Inside were hundreds of tiny wooden spoons, each not much bigger than a finger. He selected one and handed it to the soul, who eagerly grabbed it, before turning to the left to exit through one of the many gaping caves in the cavern wall.</p>
<p>The encounter stuck with Leems all through the shift, as he let thousands more souls poof into heaven. Finally, it was break time - the gates closed and the remaining lines disappeared. The horde of demons working Reception left their desks and swarmed over to the break area, to consume sulfurous coffee and rotting meat.</p>
<p>Leems sought out the hulking form of Ebnerzaz, and tugged on the supervisor's wings. "Ah, Leems! How did your first shift go? Keeping up the pace, I hope?" he asked, peering down at the smaller demon.</p>
<p>"Yes, it went very well, sir. But I did have one soul choose... the spoon."</p>
<p>"Ah, on your first day! Congratulations. It took me a week, way back when. But why are you looking so troubled?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's just... he stopped and thought about it, like you said some of them might. And his reasoning seemed pretty ironclad. If the spoon gives them a small amount of pleasure forever, is that not categorically better than a finite vacation in heaven?" Leems asked. "I thought you said there were no correct choices. I feel as though, by giving him the spoon, I have reduced the amount of suffering we'll generate."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, Leems. Do not worry. The spoon will generate plenty of suffering in due time."</p>
<p>"But how?"</p>
<p>"Because, dear Leems," Ebnerzaz said, smiling his most terrifying smile yet. "When did you ever hear of a simple wooden spoon that stays intact forever?"</p>

<p>"Why not?  Pizza is the shit," the angel said.</p>
<p>"And cursing.  And beer?  Is that beer?"</p>
<p>In fact, the table was laid out with all the things Jim loved.  Chicken wings, malt whiskey, chilly fries, club sandwiches, those little wieners wrapped in bacon.  Over the table hung a cage where two beautiful women danced naked to 90's alternative.  The angel saw him gazing.</p>
<p>"You can have them after dinner," he said.  </p>
<p>"Are they being punished?" Jim asked.  He was a man, through and through, but he didn't like the idea of raping someone in paradise.</p>
<p>"Punished?  Is that what you think we do here?  They love it.  Some women like to party.  We don't hold that against them.  Cherry there has been welcoming our new guests for two hundred years."  The angel leaned close with a knowing smile.  "There are no anal fissures in heaven, so go wild."</p>
<p>Jim coughed.  "So uh, well . . ."  He coughed again.  "What are the uh, ground rules?"</p>
<p>"Ground rules?"</p>
<p>"Like, what's the forbidden fruit?  What's the catch around here?"</p>

<h1>[WP] Two god-like beings, disguised as old men, play a game of chess on a park bench to decide the final fate of humanity. The players, however, are distracted by a couple seated across them...</h1>
<p>Score: 4126</p>
<p>"Table stakes again?" the thin man asked. He wore black, and the lines time had etched into his face were harsh.</p>
<p>"Not this time, I think," the shorter man said. He wore white, a business suit so pristine that it almost hurt to look at. The thin man cocked an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"The last game, then?" he asked. The man in white considered for a moment, then nodded. Without another word, the two set up the chessboard which lie between them. It was concrete, and set into the table they shared, so grimy that even despite the bright midsummer light of a New York day, the city's grime had rendered both the white and black spaces a nigh-indistinguishable grey. Still, the two set their pieces, each drawing polished marble figures from a case of his own possession. The man in white played black, and the man in black played white. White king's knight to f3.</p>
<p>"Conservative," the man in white said.</p>
<p>"This is the game that matters," the man in black said. Black pawn to d5. Behind the white man, a couple sashayed by--two men, holding hands. The younger of the two was also shorter, Puerto Rican, and wore a fishnet tank top. His jeans could've been sprayed on. The man in black blinked. It would be hard to imagine a more stereotypically flamboyant fellow. The Puerto Rican man led his partner, an older black man with a salt-and-pepper beard and a charcoal business suit, to the table next to the two playing chess. The two kissed, the young fellow sitting on a concrete table identical to theirs.</p>
<p>"Interesting company," the man in black said. White pawn to c4. The man in white looked over slowly, rheumy eyes thoughtful.</p>
<p>"Réti Opening," he said, slowly returning his gaze to the board. The man in black shrugged. Black pawn to e6. "It's surprising, in a way, to be playing this game, finally."</p>
<p>"All the world, hanging on a game of chess," the thin man said, and there was a note of satisfaction in his voice, of savor.  "All that ever was, all that is, and all that ever might be, decided by the movements of clicking marble and alabaster.  One of us rises, and the other done away with forever.  An eternity surrendered and true omnipotence gained."  Yes, real enjoyment now.  Anticipation.  Hunger.  White pawn to g3.</p>
<p>"Wait, what?" the black man broke away from his amorous partner.  He looked at the two old men, one in white and one in black, but he didn't break his lover's embrace.</p>
<p>"Nothing you need to fret over," the man in white said.  Black King's knight to f6.  He waved a hand, half-distracted, and the black man started to turn back to the loving arms of his partner, but he hesitated.</p>
<p>"No...  There was something you said..." he muttered, forehead creased in intense concentration, almost as if he'd just forgotten something truly important.</p>
<p>"We're playing Neo-Catalan today," the man in black said, and smiled.  "It favors white, you know."  White pawn to d4.  The man in white shrugged.</p>
<p>"You two are playing for something important," the black man said, and broke away from his partner.</p>
<p>"David," the Puerto Rican man whined, but he followed his partner's gaze.</p>
<p>"I said--" the man in white said, again raising his hand.</p>
<p>"Let them be.  It won't matter if I win, and you can erase their memories if you win," the tall man interrupted, and smiled.  He turned to the two.  "I am playing this man for the fate of all the world."  The Puerto Rican man laughed out loud, but the black man, David, remained stone-faced.</p>
<p>"You're the devil," he said, and when he said it there was a moment of perfect quiet, the thunder of the city and the park stilling for just that one instant.  The tall man smiled, but said nothing.  Black pawn to a6.  David turned a bit.  "And you're God."</p>
<p>"Not as you imagine," the man in white said, glancing up.  "Though I prefer Yahweh.  The old names are nice."</p>
<p>"David, they're having fun with you," the Puerto Rican man said, taking his partner's hand.  David didn't move.  White Queen's bishop to f4.</p>
<p>"You're off your game today," the tall man said.  "Not good."  Yahweh shrugged ever-so-slightly.  Black queen to e7.</p>
<p>"Can't you beat him?" David asked, alarm growing in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Probably," Yahweh said.  "But those aren't the rules we play by."  The man in black snorted in derision.</p>
<p>"Remarkable," he said.  "You heap abuse on them, and they still grovel for you."  David glanced over, and Yahweh cocked his head to the side.</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"Such hate for men who lie with men.  Stone them.  Burn them.  Hang them," the tall man said, sneering.</p>
<p>"It's not that simple, Lucifer.  It never is," Yahweh said.  Lucifer shook his head.  White pawn to a3.  Lucifer turned to David.</p>
<p>"Are you a man of God?" he asked.  David drew in a breath of surprise, and glanced at Yahweh.</p>
<p>"I like to think so," he said, cautious.</p>
<p>"And you are a man who lies with men.  A gay man."  It was a statement.  David nodded.  Lucifer gestured across the table at Yahweh.  "His books say you should die.  Horribly.  How can you be both?"</p>
<p>"I..." David faltered.  "I don't know.  I just am."</p>
<p>"You call that free will?" Lucifer asked.</p>
<p>"I do," Yahweh said.  Lucifer shook his head.  Yahweh turned to David.</p>
<p>"Are you happy?" he asked. David blinked.</p>
<p>"I... I don't know," he said, and both Lucifer and Yahweh paused.  "I'm kind of scared right now, to be honest."</p>
<p>"Aside from that," Yahweh said.  "Your life.  Is it good?"  David considered.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," he said.  "Not all the time.  It's complicated."</p>
<p>"You see?" Yahweh asked.  Lucifer shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>"This claptrap again," Black pawn to h5, an obvious error.  White pawn to b4, swiftly, securing the center.</p>
<p>"Why is it complicated?" Yahweh asked, seemingly unperturbed at the state of the board.</p>
<p>"Well, I love two people.  Alex," David said, and squeezed his partner's hand, "and my wife, Marissa."  Lucifer laughed.</p>
<p>"Adultery as well!" he said.  Yahweh didn't speak.</p>
<p>"They both make me happy," David continued, gaining steam.  "And I- I can't be with either one alone."  He bowed his head.  "I wish I could be honest with her, though."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Yahweh said, a small smile warming their corner of the park.  "You would do it differently?" he asked, turning back to the board.  Black king's rook to H6.</p>
<p>"Of course I would," Lucifer said.  "That's the whole point, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"How?" Yahweh asked, and Lucifer froze.</p>
<p>"You've never asked me that before," he said after a long moment.</p>
<p>"I'm asking you now."  Lucifer thought.</p>
<p>"No love would be wrong," he said, and looked at David.  "They're not hurting anyone.  Why should they be punished?"</p>
<p>"What about Marissa?" Yahweh asked.  Lucifer didn't say anything.  After a time, Yahweh asked, "What else?"</p>
<p>"Freedom," Lucifer said, and the word was a whisper.  "Real freedom.  No commandments from on high, no walls of faith or law, nor condemnation of the righteous as punishment.  Men and women could do as they pleased."  Yahweh looked surprised.</p>
<p>"You don't think they have that?"</p>
<p>"They never have," Lucifer said, and shook his head very slowly.  "You created the most magnificent of all things, beings who could truly decide their own fate with only the dictates of existence itself to restrain them.  No spiritual obligations, and yet minds as keen as the greatest of the Seraphim.  Mankind was perfect in every way, and the first thing," Lucifer broke off and chucked for a moment.  "The very first thing you do is wall them in."  He laughed again, loudly and long.  David threw an arm around Alex, and drew the smaller man close.</p>
<p>"No," he said, with a sigh of savor.  "I would see what they can really do.  Whether they could surpass even you in the fullness of time.  I would see what comes from real freedom."  White queen to a4.  "Check."  Yahweh leaned back and regarded Lucifer.</p>
<p>"Is it really that simple for you?" he asked, after a time.  Lucifer nodded.  "Well, then, I suppose that I've been playing defensively for long enough today."</p>
<p>And, slowly, Yahweh tipped his own king over.  David gasped, and Lucifer's face screwed into a mask of confusion.</p>
<p>"I don't claim that the rules I chose were right," Yahweh said, his fingertips fading.  "Only that they were the rules I chose.  I hoped to help my children grow a little taller by their existence."</p>
<p>"You didn't need to do that," Lucifer muttered, eyes still fixed on the fallen black marble king.</p>
<p>"Of course I did," Yahweh said, and Lucifer finally met his gaze.  "They weren't the only ones I gave free will to."  His rheumy eyes twinkled for a moment, and then began to fade.  "Your rebellion was my greatest triumph.  I could barely believe it when you rose up."  Lucifer's breath turned ragged.</p>
<p>"They're yours now, in a way."  There was a silence, as the last traces of Yahweh faded away.  Then, like a scarcely-heard voice on the breeze, he added, "Not so simple, is it?"</p>
<p>Nobody said anything, for a while.</p>
<p>"What happens now?" David asked, meeting Lucifer's gaze.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he said eventually.  "It's complicated."</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the comments, folks, and thanks to /u/read_know_do for pointing out where my inexperience at real chess messed up the game.  Hopefully, it's fixed now.</p>

<h1>[WP] Valhalla is filled with the strongest warriors the world has ever known. Vikings, Spartans, Mongols, Romans, Samurai, Spetznaz, JSOC Operators. And in that corner over there? That's Ted, from accounting.</h1>
<p>Score: 4095</p>
<p>One of the peculiarities about Valhalla was that time had no meaning.<br />
Warriors did not arrive in Valhalla chronologically, they arrived based on how glorious their battle prowess and their death had been.<br />
Högdar the Huge had just arrived in Valhalla, after mortally maiming twenty Englishmen and being shot through the heart by an arrow.<br />
The hall was just as vast as legend had foretold; the rafters disappearing in darkness and hazed by the thick smoke from the firepits that lined the hall.<br />
He quickly found some of his battle brothers from previous skirmishes and roared in greeting, immediately swapping tales of his deeds leading up to his death.<br />
The hall was not at all full, he noted; less than two thousand warriors of various races and genders filled the benches, eating, drinking and fighting.<br />
"I am pleased that I arrived early," he shouted to his companions, "who would want to be last into Valhalla? The shame would be unbearable!"<br />
His friends roared with laughter and thrust a horn of mead into his hand.<br />
As Högdar drank, his good eye roved over the assorted warriors. In one corner sat a group of strange men in green uniforms, patterned like a forest canopy. They leaned on unnatural looking weapons and sported gaudy, meaningless tattoos.<br />
"Marines," said Halfdan, "from the future. Great warriors - their leader was amongst the first to arrive in Valhalla."<br />
Högdar raised a scarred eyebrow and re-appraised the soldiers. Appearances could be deceiving.<br />
"Odin was first here, of course," continued Halfdan, "as he is the greatest warrior of all."<br />
Reaching for another horn, Högdar casually asked,<br />
"Who was second?"<br />
A sudden hush descended on the vast hall and Högdar felt unease creep up his spine like a spider made of frost.<br />
All eyes had turned to a secluded nook, far from the smoke, noise and heat, where a small man sat, clothed in black trousers and a neat white shirt and tie. His leather shoes were polished brightly and a pair of spectacles perched below a receding hairline and a brow full of worry lines.<br />
"I was," said Ted, from accounting.<br />
Högdar rose from the bench and drew his sword - still bloody with the ichor of his fallen foes.<br />
"WHAT JEST IS THIS?" he bellowed.<br />
"Shh! Högdar, my friend, sit <em>down!</em>" crooned Halfdan, "leave the man be."<br />
But the strong alcohol had begun to kick in and Högdar's blood was still hot from battle.<br />
"I WILL NOT! It is an insult to Odin, to my ancestors and to me that this <em>worm</em> of a man sits amongst the greatest warriors of all time!"<br />
A Mongolian horse archer in leather and fur armour stood, his steely, dead eyes boring into the agitated Viking,<br />
"Northman. You sit. Shut mouth."<br />
"Freya's tits I will!" Högdar shot back, brandishing his weapon, foam spraying from his lips.<br />
"You insult Ted." the stocky archer said flatly.<br />
"Aye, that I do! And what are you going to do about it, you slit-eyed horse-lover?"<br />
Högdar didn't even see Ted move.<br />
All he was aware of was that suddenly he couldn't feel the rest of his body and the ground was rapidly approaching.<br />
He stared up into the thin, pinched features and blue stubble of Ted's annoyed face.<br />
The small man pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and retrieved something from Högdar's neck.<br />
Ted wiped off his titanium Parker pen with a bloody handkerchief and regarded the paralysed Viking.<br />
"Didn't anyone ever tell you that the pen is mightier than the sword?"</p>

<p>"No Mr. Brock. I'm sorry Jason, but if you cannot commit to your schedule, you don't have what it takes 
to work in this company."</p>
<p>I lower my head. I feel my eyes water.</p>
<p>I mean, it's one thing to yell at me because I left five minutes early yesterday -- after being the only one doing 
unpaid extra hours until midnight for the fifth week in row now.</p>
<p>But to fire me because of it? And in front of everybody?</p>
<p>I feel like that's kind of mean of Mr. Brock's part.</p>
<p>People are looking. I hate this.</p>
<p>"Are you going to cry, Jason? Really? You are a grown man. Get yourself together."</p>
<p>Lisa from accounting passes by and stops to watch. Everyone in their cubicle has 
their heads raised to watch the scene, as well.</p>
<p>I hate being in the spotlight. I'm not good at confrontation.</p>
<p>"Mr. Brock, please. I can put in more hours, if you want. I can --"</p>
<p>"Sorry, Jason. I need a person who can commit. I need someone responsible."</p>
<p>Come on. You are right, man. Stand up for yourself. Say something.</p>
<p>Brock never did extra hours. Neither did Lisa, or Tobias.</p>
<p>You are always the last one in the office, and you are also the one paid less.</p>
<p>Say something. Everybody is watching. Say something. Say something.</p>
<p>I hate this. Stop crying.</p>
<p>"Mr. Brock, c-can we talk in your office? I really need this job. I can --"</p>
<p>Mr. Brock throws a cardboard box my way. "We have nothing more to talk about, Jason."</p>
<p>He turns around and steps away, heading for his big office with his big window and his big trophies.</p>
<p>Little by little, the heads start lowering back to their computers. I start putting my stuff in the little box, feeling 
five different kinds of shitty.</p>
<p>I'm done in like five minutes. It's pretty easy, what with no pictures of family or kids. No pictures of the wife. No macaroni pen holder.</p>
<p>I don't have a lot of stuff to show for, in this life.</p>
<p>I put the last of my action figures (John Constantine, from Hellblazer) on the box and I get up, sniffing. </p>
<p>"Well... See you guys. I -- goodbye."</p>
<p>No one answers. People type away and drink their coffee away, distracted. I start walking.</p>
<p>I'm almost by the door when I hear it.</p>
<p>"MOTHERFUCKER!"</p>
<p>And a loud bang.</p>
<p>Like really really loud. </p>
<p>I stop and turn around, and everyone else does the same.</p>
<p>Black smoke is coming out from under Mr. Brock's door.</p>
<p>Little by little, slow motion step by slow motion step, I approach, because no one else seems to be willing to move. There's silence on the other end of the door.</p>
<p>Before I can reach the knob the door opens on its own, and everyone goes "Oh!" (except for Mr. Trigger from HR, who just says 'oh fuck this shit', gets up and leaves. We never saw him again.)</p>
<p>These reactions were prompted by the fact that, on the other side of the door, Mr. Brock was now seven different, completely separate objects, spread around his office.</p>
<p>His head and torso is lying on top of his desk, in the middle of a pool of blood.</p>
<p>His legs are on opposite sides of the room. So are his arms.</p>
<p>His penis and left ball are dangling from the roof fan, casually.</p>
<p>His right ball is on the floor by the door, right next to a squirrel holding a bazooka.</p>
<p>I'm gonna repeat that:</p>
<p>His right ball is on the floor by the door, right next to a squirrel holding a bazooka.</p>
<p>Lisa from accounting faints.</p>
<p>"Took care of this piece of flying, stinky shit, master", the squirrel says, smiling at me. His voice is high pitched and scratchy, like the voice of an old lady on 3 packs of Camels a day for the past 70 years.</p>
<p>I look at the squirrel for seventeen seconds, in complete silence.</p>
<p>Jenny from marketing faints, too.</p>
<p>Jack from HR whispers "holy shit", and has a heart attack. </p>
<p>(He died  a week later, I heard.)</p>
<p>"What?" I ask, suddenly realizing I hadn't blinked in a very long time.</p>
<p>I blink.</p>
<p>"The Abomination, they call me", the squirrel says, with a smirk. "Paid assassin. You saved my life on January 13th, 
down Berry Road, remember? Squirrel law determines I am now at your service. I took the liberty of doing a background check on your life. You got a lot of people being assholes to you and dragging you down. I'm here to take care of that for you."</p>
<p>"I-- Mr. Brock was not disturbing me. I -- he was an asshole, sure, but I didn't -- I mean..."</p>
<p>I take a deep breath. What little people on the office that have not yet fainted or had heart attacks (or walked away 
saying 'fuck this shit') are frozen watching the scene in a catatonic state.</p>
<p>The squirrel grabs Mr. Brock's right ball, throwing it over his left shoulder like a sports bag. "Now come on, let's get even with the world. Like I said, a lot of people have been fucking you over, Jason. It's time to grow up and be a man. Time to set the record straight."</p>
<p>"I.... Wh-what do you mean?"</p>
<p>The squirrel grabs me by the hand. He drags me towards the door.</p>
<p>People are watching still, frozen.</p>
<p>"Do you know a Ed Williams, Jason?" the squirrel asks, almost by the door.</p>
<p>"Yeah, he's my neighbor", I say, worrying about what's coming next.</p>
<p>"Could you grab the doorknob, please?" The Abomination looks up at the doorknob, out of his reach.</p>
<p>I turn it and open the door.</p>
<p>People are still frozen, staring at me.</p>
<p>Mike from research and development faints. Then he wakes up.</p>
<p>Then he faints again.</p>
<p>"What about Ed Williams?" I ask, as the squirrel drags me out into the hallway.</p>
<p>"He's stealing your TV Guides", The Abomination, says, shutting the door behind us with his feet. "Let's go shove a cactus up his ass."</p>
<p>And he drags me to the elevator.</p>

<h1>[WP] A man dies and goes to Heaven, only to find that every day there is a mandatory viewing of everyone in hell, where he sees his mom and wife burning</h1>
<p>Score: 3970</p>
<p>Everybody loves Hitler.</p>
<p>It's 8 o'clock sharp, not that time matters in the eternal kingdom of heaven, and the Impale Adolf Hitler Interactive Exhibit opens up right on schedule. The angels have been waiting. Popcorn in one hand and pitchforks in the other, the moment the exhibit opens, all the good people of heaven go wild stabbing the ever-loving <em>shit</em> out of a scared defenceless German.</p>
<p>Tyler doesn't care for that. Not today. Today, he's finally worked up the courage to see the two exhibits he's avoided all his afterlife. One, his biological mother. This will be the first time Tyler meets her. Two, his widowed wife. This will be the last time Tyler can bear to see her.</p>
<p>The Tour Guide took time out of His almighty schedule to personally show them to Tyler.</p>
<p>"Are you ready, my child?"</p>
<p>"No." Tyler adjusts his halo. "Let's do it." </p>
<p>Starting from the ticket booth, they walk slowly through the Museum Of Eternal Damnation (Formerly Known As Hell). They stroll past Jeffrey Dahmer, being skinned alive by angels. They go around Ted Kaczynski, being strung up by fishing hooks. They make a right on Pol Pot, being boiled alive in his Pol Pot.</p>
<p>Tyler needs to ask. "Why are they here."</p>
<p>"Well, my son, amongst acts of cannibalism and necrophil--"</p>
<p>"No, uh... I mean Casey and my mother. The biological mom, that is."</p>
<p>"Ah." The Guide pauses. "Tell me about your wife, Casey."</p>
<p>"You're the omniscient one, you tell me."</p>
<p>"Humour an old man."</p>
<hr />
<p>"Sigh. She saved my life. My pathetic, miserable excuse for a life. Well... apparently you judged otherwise, but she was <em>my</em> angel, you-dammit.</p>
<p>We met on my 21st birthday. I was partying and drinking with my college frat friends, instead of studying for the finals. Suddenly, Casey. She crashed the party, and I mean <em>crashed</em>. She looked like she was, what, late-twenties? I later found out she was actually 33. At first we all thought she was a professor or something -- she's certainly got the smarts -- but around the moment we were making out half-naked on the beer-stained couch, I figured differently.</p>
<p>Jerry teased me for <em>months</em> about being a cougar's cub. He was my best man.</p>
<p>Casey turned my life around. She is... well, was... the founder of some really big biotech startup. She got me a summer internship, my first real job, doing community management for the company. Basically, tweeting. But she made sure I got opportunities to learn and do more skilled jobs, and I moved up and up until I became the Chief Marketing Officer!</p>
<p>Then some asshole hit me with a truck. And here we are."</p>
<p>The Guide was silent for a while.</p>
<p>"Thank you, my child. Would you like to know how she died?"</p>
<p>"Wow. You gotta rub it in like that?"</p>
<p>"Would you?"</p>
<p>"...yes. Tell me."</p>
<p>"Suicide."</p>
<p>"Fuck. Fuck you, <em>fuck</em> you. Is that why she's here? Because we loved each other so much she couldn't wait to see me again?"</p>
<p>"Well... yes and no."</p>
<p>"<em>WHY CAN'T YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS NORMALLY.</em>"</p>
<p>The angels outside the Stuff Albert Fish Into A Meat Grinder Interactive Exhibit were getting concerned about the angry angel behind them arguing with the big guy. They pretended not to notice, and casually continued turning the crank on a half-ground-up Fish. </p>
<hr />
<p>Tyler and the Guide silently moved on.</p>
<p>They were now in the far back of the Museum, the wing of the lesser evils, or rather, the less famous evils. Almost no-one visits this section. Hence, rather than being granted individual exhibits, the captives here get filed away in glass boxes, clearly labelled with their primary sin. To Tyler's left, "These Peeps Killed Someone To Death". To his right, "These Peeps Assaulted Someone With Their Dick".</p>
<p>It's a long walk.</p>
<p>"My son, how are you feeling?"</p>
<p>"Oh that reminds me. How's my son?"</p>
<p>"Your best friend and best man, Jerry, adopted him. He's giving your son the best medical care they can afford. He might even grow up to have a healthy, normal life."</p>
<p>"Jerry's a good guy."</p>
<p>"I'll remember that in forty years' time."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"So... what about my mother?"</p>
<p>"What about your mother?"</p>
<p>"We've talked so much about Casey. Aren't we going to talk about my biological mother? I mean, I've never met her, so I can't tell you anything about her."</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"Okay, fine. I know she dumped me at a hospital. I know she left a note saying 'I'll find you someday'. I know she never did. Look, dude. I think I deserve to know more about my biological mother. Can't we talk about her?"</p>
<p>"We already have."</p>
<p>"Sheesh. See, that's the kind of cryptic answer nonsense I'm talking about. I know you like to 'work in mysterious ways', but it puts people off. Seriously. Have you noticed you've had a lower percentage of active members across all Abrahamic religions recently? I think after a couple millennia, it's high time you reboot your brand. Build a new identity. I could help! We need to make your brand cleaner, more cool, more hip. Remember that thing you did with the Top 10 List? On the stone tablets? That was <em>genius</em>. Way ahead of its time. Maybe if we did more of that again, this time on modern-day tablets, we'd--"</p>
<p>"We're here."</p>
<hr />
<p>Tyler spins his head around to where the Guide is pointing. He doesn't look at the box's label. He doesn't spare a glance at the thousands of starving people covered in piss and shit and blood. He only sees her.</p>
<p>"Casey."</p>
<p>He looks into her pale blue eyes, partially obscured by unkempt blonde hair. She's still beautiful. Covered in her own faeces, but still beautiful, at least to Tyler. He looks <em>directly</em> in her eyes, but...</p>
<p>"She doesn't recognize me."</p>
<p>Casey blinks. She scratches the rope burn on her neck. She blinks again, and turns away to look at an inmate trying to lick their own elbow.</p>
<p>"She doesn't recognize me."</p>
<p>"My child, I am so sorry."</p>
<p>"Why doesn't she--"</p>
<p>"Sometimes, people lose their minds before they're lucky enough to lose their life."</p>
<p>"What?! You can't, like, restore their minds or something?"</p>
<p>"I can. Would you like me to do that now?"</p>
<p>Tyler looks back at the glass box. That broken woman, wearing the skin of his former beloved, is not his former beloved. The mouth they once shared passionate kisses with, is now idiotically attempting to lick an elbow.</p>
<p>"...no."</p>
<p>"Then I shall not."</p>
<p>"I'm done. I can't do this. I don't want to see my biological mother anymore, either."</p>
<p>"My child..."</p>
<p>"What. What now."</p>
<p>"...you've already seen her."</p>
<p>"Oh. Did we walk past her on the way here? You didn't say anyth--"</p>
<p>At that moment, all the pieces fall in place, as Tyler's mind falls to pieces. It's not true. He's never seen his biological mom. It's not true. She promised to come back for him. It is not true. Casey went directly towards him at that college party. It's a lie. Casey turned his life around, she took care of him, she raised him. It can't be true. Tyler and Casey's son came out deformed and sick. No, no no no please God it cannot cannot CANNOT BE--</p>
<p>Casey successfully touches her elbow with her tongue. She lets out a victory squeal.</p>
<p>Tyler hears her, and looks up. This time, he sees the label on the glass box.</p>

<h1>[WP] In a world where puns are illegal, one man rises up in opposition.</h1>
<p>Score: 3808</p>
<p>“Sir, I was looking for you,” Howard said, staring at the back of the chief’s neck. “We got him.” He turned around slowly, eyes staring down at a manila folder in his hands. He was an intimidating man, even despite his enlarged belly and the countless wrinkles spiraling down his face, neck, and everywhere else. Tall, maybe 6’2’’, and still quite muscular—especially for a 63-year-old that refused to retire. He was bald now, but he’d had thick, black hair when Howard had first joined the department over a decade ago. Even after all that time, he still felt as if he were a child talking to an adult whenever he was around the chief.</p>
<p>“Him? Who is him?” Chief said, not looking up from the manila folder.</p>
<p>“Him,” Howard said, nodding toward the folder. “We got him.”</p>
<p>“Him? Al? You got Al?” Chief said, glancing up from the folder in his hand, then slowly closing the cover. A large, red “CONFIDENTIAL” was stamped across its front.</p>
<p>“We did, he was outside of an arboretum. We caught him red handed. No, red lipped. Red worded? We caught him in the act is what I’m trying to say.”</p>
<p>“The fuck is an arboretum?”</p>
<p>“Sir, it’s a garden with a large collection of trees instead of flowers. Kind of like a forest, except man made,” Howard said. “It’s basically a forest.”</p>
<p>“Where is there an arboretum in New York?”</p>
<p>“Central Park. Does it matter? We got him.”</p>
<p>“Where is he?” Chief said, glancing around the room. The veins on his neck, visible through his wrinkled, dried skin, popped out slightly as he swiveled his head.</p>
<p>“He’s in the interrogation room.” Howard nodded toward the big, metal door on his left. </p>
<p>“How do you know you got the right guy?” Chief asked.</p>
<p>“He was standing outside of the arboretum telling people they were barking up the wrong tree.” Howard paused. “You know, bark: like a tree has.” </p>
<p>“My god,” said Chief, lowering the folder down to the side of his left leg. </p>
<p>“That—that wasn’t all,” Howard said, stuttering slightly. “When I approached him, he told me to leaf him alone. Not leave, but leaf. To leaf him alone.”</p>
<p>Chief slowly walked to the wooden table in the corner of the room and lowered the manila folder onto the top of it. He placed both palms down and sighed. </p>
<p>“We got a real sicko on our hands, Howard. You did good getting him off the street. Has he confessed yet?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. We sent Chuck in earlier. He came out in tears, an absolute wreck. He didn't even get a chance to turn on the recorder. Said he wouldn’t stop punning, that Al told him to spruce up the place. Said that it would help us branch out creatively. Chuck tried to play it off, tried to be the tough guy, but Al just didn’t let up.” Howard turned his head toward the metal door to his left. “Chuck told me Al claimed he had an idea for an escape that he maple off. Maple, not may pull. He made it clear that it was a pun.” Howard exhaled deeply and stared up at the ceiling. “He said Al called all of us saps, and that he wooden be surprised if he just walked out the front door. Wooden. Like wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“Dear lord in heaven,” Chief said, lifting his palms off the table then smashing his fist down on top of the manila folder. “God damn this monster. I’m going to go in,” he said. </p>
<p>“Chief,” Howard pleaded, his voice higher than he had intended it.</p>
<p>“No, I have to do this. I can’t send any more of my men in. I need to be the one to face this maniac.”</p>
<p>Howard nodded and took a step back so that the door was clear. Chief slowly unbuttoned his sport coat, revealing a leather holster underneath. He unlatched it, the grip of his Glock now exposed, then re-fastened the top button on the jacket. </p>
<p>“Turn the recorder on by the window. If it gets too much, please leave the room. I will not hold it against you. Just make sure the recorder is running—we can’t let him go this time.”</p>
<p>Chief exhaled, brushing the side of his hand down the front of his jacket, then made his way toward the door, unlocking it and pulling it open before stepping inside. Howard walked around the wall to the one-way window, flipped on the old tape-deck recorder, and peered inside. </p>
<p>“Al?” Chief said, sliding a chair out from the metal table in the middle of the room. “I’m Dave Johnson, Chief of Police. Do you know why you’re in here?”</p>
<p>Al glanced up at the chief, but seemed to be looking toward the corner of the room.</p>
<p>“That,” Al said, pointing to a whiteboard in the back of the room, “over there.”</p>
<p>The chief turned around. “The whiteboard? What about it?”</p>
<p>“It’s remarkable.” </p>
<p>Howard involuntarily smashed his fist down on the table in front of the glass, but the chief seemed not to notice Al’s pun. </p>
<p>“Nothing remarkable about it.”</p>
<p>“The whiteboard,” Al repeated, “it’s remarkable. Re-markable.”</p>
<p>The chief squinted slightly, as if he were in pain. “Seems unremarkable to me. Now please answer the question. Do you know why you’re here?”</p>
<p>Al sighed. “Let me guess, is it because of the two pieces of string I ate?”</p>
<p>“What?” said the chief.</p>
<p>“The string, I ate two pieces of string. I shit you not.”</p>
<p>Chief’s face became visibly tense, a reddish hue slowly replacing his normal pale color. “You are here for your puns, Al. You’ve been on the pun,” Chief stopped, his eyes wide. “Run. You’ve been on the run for a long time, but we got you. And we have you recorded making these puns.”</p>
<p>Al stared down at the metal table and his eyes closed. “I know,” he said. </p>
<p>“So you admit it?”</p>
<p>“You think I like making puns? You think I like breaking the law?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t like it, then why do you do it?”</p>
<p>Al slowly lifted his head back up toward the chief. </p>
<p>“A long time ago, I was kidnapped and brutally tortured. My life was threatened and I was brought to the brink of death. Do you know what that’s like? Six men accosted me, beat me and chained me to a tree as I walked home. They said they’d tell me ten puns to dictate my future. If I survived, then I was free to go. They told me no one had ever lived through them, they assured me I would die. They laughed when they said that, stared straight in my eyes and pulled the chain tighter to keep me from squirming. Then they began. Each pun was said with hate, each one was meant to kill me. Yet in the end, no pun in ten did.”</p>
<p>The chief’s eyes rolled back in his head, his torso slumping forward onto the table in front of him. He began convulsing, seizing hard enough to knock the chair out from under him, his body plummeting to the floor behind the desk. Howard tried to reach for the alarm on the far right of the window, to hit the button and call for help, yet his limbs refused move. His mind refused to listen. The room turned black.</p>
<p>Howard awoke to a uniformed man standing over him, one of the new recruits he’d not yet learned the name of. He was towering over Howard, yelling for him to get up.</p>
<p>“Gone!” shouted the recruit.</p>
<p>“Huh,” Howard said, voice groggy and slow. </p>
<p>“He’s gone. He took the tapes and he’s gone.”</p>
<p>“Ch-chief,” Howard said, pulling himself up. His arms felt weak, as if he’d spent the past few hours lifting weights. “Where’s the chief.”</p>
<p>“He’s okay, we’ve got him in the office. He’s awake. You’re both going to be fine.”</p>
<p>“Al,” Howard said, remembering the barrage of puns. “Where did he go?” </p>
<p>“He’s gone,” said the recruit.</p>
<p>“Where did he go?” Howard repeated, now shouting.</p>
<p>“Gone, sir. He walked right out the front door.” The recruit paused, but Howard could tell he wasn’t yet done speaking. “We also have reason to believe the name we’ve been calling him is fake.”</p>
<p>“What? Why? We had him here, he responded to Al. All the background checks matched his name.”</p>
<p>“It’s just, his name. Mr. O’Bye. Al O’Bye.”</p>
<p>A stinging pain shot through Howard’s skull. Alibi. Why hadn’t he seen it before; that was why his history was so clean, why he had been so elusive. They were tracking a ghost.</p>
<p>“Fuck me,” Howard muttered, holding his left hand to his throbbing temple. He stared into the empty interrogation room.</p>
<p>“Sir, that’s not all,” said the recruit. He picked up a folded piece of paper from table and handed it to Howard. “He—well—he left you a note.”</p>
<p>Howard stared at the paper. “Detective,” it read in cursive on the front, hand written in blue ink. He flipped it open. </p>
<p>“You ask me why I do what I do, what makes me who I am. Yet you don’t even know who it is that I am. Perhaps I’m simply an unappreciated baker getting revenge on the world after suffering through long hours because I kneaded the dough. Maybe I’m a forlorn banker, doing this because I’ve finally lost interest. Or maybe I’m just a backwards poet, writing inverse and making no sense. Yet, in the end, you're not much different than I. You stay up all night and day, searching for me, wondering who I am, waiting for the light that never comes. Only when I stayed out too late waiting for that sun to rise, it dawned on me.</p>
<p>It’s been my pleasure meeting you, perhaps I will see you around.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mae B. Layter”</p>
<p>Howard lowered the note, a warm sensation running down his face as if an insect were crawling on the flesh above his lip. He placed his left hand beneath his nose, rubbed it, and then glanced down at his fingers. They were covered in blood. Darkness again drowned out his vision.</p>

<p>"Listen, Andrew," She'd sent me a letter with his name and a bunch of information about him, but I never thought it would lead to anything. Never thought I'd even remember the name of his school, and his best friend. And of all places, Xbox live? Who would have thought that I'd coincidentally find my own son, and that my first impression of him would be his username: 6969BongHitterX. And to add insult to injury, he was camping near a respawn point. I'd failed as a father.</p>
<p>"Faggot, I pwned you so hard! Listen to you cry!"</p>
<p>"I'm serious! Your mom... is her name Sarah? Is she blond, a nurse at the hospital? And her father owns Mike's Bistro in town?"</p>
<p>"Boom, headshot!" He wasn't listening to me; he'd gone back to running around the map looking for a new weapon. Had he muted me? Had I already lost my chance? </p>
<p>"Andrew, you need to listen." My character was following him around the map trying to get his attention. "Your mother..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I fucked your mother! I did it in your own basement, you neckbeard faggot!"</p>
<p>"I'm serious!" I shouted back to him as he shot my character yet again. I grumbled angrily, waiting to respawn and searching the map for him once more. "You need to listen to me! You live on Elm Avenue, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Who is this?" he squeaked into the microphone. I could hear the puberty in his voice. "Sam, is this you, you faggot? I'm going to kick your ass at school tomorrow, you little bitch!"</p>
<p>"Andrew, your mom has a tattoo of a rose on the back of her neck, doesn't she?"</p>
<p>His avatar stopped moving, and his microphone fell silent. Our characters stood looking at each other awkwardly until we were both splattered by another group driving a Warthog. Without another word, Andrew left the game. I sighed and signed out too. I guess it wasn't meant to be.</p>
<hr />
<p>"who is this?" the message said. </p>
<p>It had been days, but he hadn't even answered my friend request. Every night I debated whether I should just contact his mother again. Just talking to him, even through the game, made the whole thing so... <em>real</em>. Before that, he was just some kid that was out there somewhere. An abstract idea that I was sure was doing just fine without me. Sarah had made it clear that they didn't need me in their lives, and I was fine with that back then. I was more into drugs anyway. A lot had changed in twelve years.</p>
<p>"I know this is going to be weird... but I'm your father. I used to live in Perryville too, years and years ago. Your mom and I were both counselors at the same summer camp, and we just had one of those romances. But at the end of the summer, we just went our separate ways. I went off to college and she stuck around. And she didn't tell me I had a kid until a few years later. She sent me occasional letters and pictures of you, but I just.... I never thought about it too much until now. Would you maybe like to meet and talk about it sometime?"</p>
<p>My hands shook as I typed the question. Was I really ready for this? But it wasn't up to me at this point. The ball was in my son's court. </p>
<p>A week later, he answered: "ok."</p>
<hr />
<p>I waited nervously at the coffee shop. I'd driven eleven hours to meet Andrew, and I was a jittery mess, I'm sure. But that didn't matter. I could barely contain my excitement at being reunited. I briefly wondered whether Sarah would be with him. He hadn't mentioned telling her, but hopefully he was smart enough to not meet strangers off of the internet without even telling his mom. </p>
<p>The bell chimed, and I looked up immediately, as I had done the last dozen times someone entered the store. And this time, it was him. He wore faded jeans and an old t-shirt that might have actually been one of mine. Had his mother really saved it for all these years? </p>
<p>I stood up tentatively from behind the table. My legs didn't seem to be working very well, and I had to lean on the back of my chair for support. Our eyes met, and I instantly knew it was my son. The exact same shape and hazel shade that stared back at me through the mirror every morning. My lips quivered into a nervous smile. It was really happening. I was finally going to meet him. </p>
<p>"Andrew?" I asked. He nodded; there was just a hint of tears welling up in the corner of his eyes. </p>
<p>I didn't know what to do. Do we... shake hands? Hug? We approached each other awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Dad?" It was definitely the same voice I'd heard through the Xbox microphone.</p>
<p>I punched him straight in the face, so hard that it sent him reeling back against the door. A collective gasp rose from the horrified barista and the shocked patrons of the coffeeshop.</p>
<p>"Headshot, you little bastard! No scope!"</p>
<p>He slumped to the floor, clutching at his bleeding nose. And as I crowed with victory, I teabagged the little faggot.</p>

<p>There are six hundred and twelve rooms in the world. It might seem like a lot, but that's six hundred and twelve rooms for a thousand people, especially when there are eighty kitchens, forty bathing facilities, and one room which opens up only once a day with supplies.</p>
<p>The last room? That one's mine. It's the biggest room, and is the only one with a lockable door.</p>
<p>We all woke up here with no memories of any prior world. We remembered our names, how to read and write, stuff like that. But other than that? Nothing. My name is Gerald Howzer. That took me a while to remember. I also remembered that I shouldn't be naked. I walked around, and saw women scrambling around. There was some panic, some arguing, and others just efficiently looking around. They were naked too.</p>
<p>The women were aged twelve to fifty five. All colors, shapes, and sizes. Within a week, I had a lover. She was named Marcella, a beautiful woman with an accent I felt I should be able to place. Within a month, we lived in my room, at the time on the ground floor out of the ten. It had great lighting, and a comfortable bed. A week later, Marcella was dead. Fell off the tenth floor railing.</p>
<p>Everyone knew she was pushed. That's when the government started. Rationing out food fairly helped. Nightly patrols, to keep the peace. A legal system, with the lockable room used as a prison. I was a judge. Judge Howzer. Somehow it felt natural.</p>
<p>Of course, there were some troubles. Yes, I took lovers, keeping it casual. After a few months, one of the women was pregnant. It really didn't take a genius to figure who was the father. I was actually proud. Jamie, gorgeous little thing. At seventeen, and with all the enthusiasm in the world. She was beaten to death within a day once the rumor got out.</p>
<p>This time the killer was caught. The trial was pandemonium. She said that it's unfair. She wanted to be a mother too, but I turned her down. Why should all the pretty ones get a chance to be mothers, while the rest were to not be allowed even that? She was locked away for being a murderer. Everyone hated her.</p>
<p>But her words took root.</p>
<p>It took a year, but the revolution happened. The current regime solved all the issues. I now live in a lockable room. They lock it from the outside. Every day I get two to five visits. Until the woman is satisfied, I don't get water or food. I tried to resist, but they punished me. I don't want to talk about that.</p>
<p>I've been having sex with everything. I felt unclean the first time a twelve year old girl came. By the time the woman in her fifties came, I didn't even bat an eye. My body was used to working on demand. I remember Marcella a lot lately. We'd talk. I made her laugh. She made me smile. In a perfect world, we'd still be in our room, maybe raising a child. I've never met a child of mine.</p>
<p>I've been in this room for ten years now. A few of the women talk to me. Most don't, or address me as "you" and then dole out commands. From what I understand, it's fairly peaceful. We're six hundred and ninety strong. Eighty three of those are my children. The boys have all vanished. The insanity that followed that caused a lot of deaths.</p>
<p>Someone should be coming soon, and I must put back this journal back into it's hiding place. For what it's worth, I'm sorry Marcella. I'm sorry Jamie. To all my daughters, know that my biggest fear is the day when you walk through that door. I love you all.</p>

<p>Jesse dug her fingernails into the armrests.  Only after a few seconds did she realize that on one side she was accidentally digging into the fingers of the man in the window seat.  She quickly moved her hand, and yelped out a 'Sorry'.  </p>
<p>The man turned to her and smiled, a calm gentle smile, a smile that did not fit with the violent turbulence rocking the plane.  "It's quite alright." His voice was so soft and serene.  It immediately calmed her down. </p>
<p>"I've just never been on a flight with turbulence like this before." She was imploring him for more comfort, she wanted him to tell her that everything was going to be fine.  If he told her that she would be fine, she would believe him.</p>
<p>But he looked around the plane and said, "Yes, this is far worse than any turbulence I've experienced either."  She felt her stomach tighten as he said that, she had been counting on comfort from this man more than she realized, and the matter-of-fact tone which he had said that had stripped it from her.</p>
<p>"I hope we'll all be alright," she said.  He had moved his hand from the armrest, so she quickly gripped it again, her knuckles were white from the strain.</p>
<p>"It does not seem likely," he said, still looking around the plane.  </p>
<p>"What?" the knot in her stomach was moving up to her throat.</p>
<p>"If you look around the plane you can see that we are definitely tilted at a downwards angle.  This means that the plane is likely losing altitude.  The only reason I could think for this to occur is some sort of engine failure, and given that we are currently travelling above the Himalayas, a safe emergency landing seems unlikely."</p>
<p>"What are you-" was all Jesse could manage before a loud explosion rocked the cabin.  She couldn't see where it came from, but the plane immediately started to plummet.  The oxygen mask came down and Jesse desperately fumbled with it to fix it to her face.  She finally attached it and looked at the man next to her. To her surprise he had not put on his mask, more so he did not look worried at all.  In fact, he looked her in the eyes, and smiled.  That same serene smile that was so out of place.  He slowly placed his hand on top of hers, the gentle pressure of his hand was so comforting. She locked eyes with him.  She needed him to tell her she wasn't going to die.  She needed him to tell her she was going to be alright.  "Please sir, I don't want to die here.  I want to go back home.  I want to see my parents again.  I want to see my boyfriend.  I want to see my cat.   I don't want to die.  Please, tell me I'll be fine."</p>
<p>He broke eye contact with her for just a second and frowned.  "You will be fine." He spoke the words and a wave of relief washed over her.  She let go of the arm rest and gripped his hand as hard as she could.  He still just held hers with the gentlest amount of pressure.  "Death is not the tragedy that the living fear it will be.  It is merely the next step on a very long journey."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>He looked out the window, the mountains were rapidly rising up to meet them.  He turned to her placing his other hand underneath hers, and held it firmly.  "I mean, you will never know how much I envy you."</p>

<p>Score: 3502</p>
<p>His home life left a lot to be wanted. Poverty in the sixties in England was no joke, especially in a mill town where alcoholism and beating the family was the norm, rather than the exception. Pre-Thatcher UK was a different place. Working class people did not get to hang around middle class or upper class ones. It was unheard of. And even though his father was worse than most, he still would have grown up fine if he wasn't different.</p>
<p>Crooked teeth due to malnutrition causing his jaw to be underdeveloped. His nose had been broken by his father so many times that it would never have a semblance of normalcy. His mother didn't do much. His father didn't like much of anything. Always hungry, resorting to hand-me-downs not only from his father because they were too scarce, but from his mother as well. He was bullied relentlessly. He learned to steal, lie, cheat and fight very well by then.</p>
<p>He was nine years old. Both his curse and his hope could be summed up in one word: <em>magic</em>. And  he had found someone he could share it with. Her name was Lily. They couldn't meet in public, because she was middle class, and the scandal would cause both their parents to force them apart. But that would be fine, because once they went to Hogwarts, they could be seen together in public. And that made everything seem better.</p>
<p>Severus Snape got sorted into Slytherin. He heard good things about it from his mother, when she spoke of a time when she wasn't so beaten down. Lily was in Gryffindor. His hope that they could be seen together in public vanished in that moment. His hope for acceptance from his peers got destroyed by the first night, when he was beaten for being a <em>mongrel</em>, a <em>half-breed</em>. His impure blood and his poverty made him a pariah in his own house.</p>
<p>Four Gryffindor students would hunt him down relentlessly. Still, his life on the street prepared him for it. Along with his talent to invent spells, he rarely came out wanting. But the staff were a problem. He was always blamed, because Horace Slughorn, his head of house, was surprisingly cold towards him. Many years later, he understood that being a brilliant half blood from an abusive background scared the old man, parallels to Voldemort running through his head. But as a child, he learned that he needed to make alliances with his loathsome dorm mates.</p>
<p>It wasn't a choice, not really. He needed protection, and they needed someone to help them with potions and were afraid of his inventiveness with curses. Some of them were actually rather decent. Avery and Rosier didn't sneer at him anymore. Sure, he had to learn a bit of their ideology so he could understand what they were talking about. He didn't really agree with it, but they offered him something he didn't know he wanted - a chance to belong.</p>
<p>He saw that Lily was listening to her friends. They all told her he was evil, disgusting, horrible, <em>dark</em>. And what was worse, he saw how she was attracted to James Potter, his main bully. It all came to a head when once again, Potter had humiliated him in front of the entire school. She came in and lashed out against James, but she was holding back a smile. She had found his humiliation funny. He had never felt so hurt, and so angry. So he said the most horrible thing he could think of to her. If she wouldn't learn to respect him because he was weak, then she would never feel what he would like her to feel.</p>
<p>She never forgave him. She forgave Potter for everything though. The fact that he was a bully, treated her possessively, was arrogant beyond belief, that was forgivable. Because he was rich, handsome, and oh so popular. Severus knew he would never be any of those. But, he could be powerful. He could have a group of allies that would be even more impressive than schoolyard popularity. He may have not believed in what they believed, but he didn't care.</p>
<p>They offered him everything he wanted. A higher education which he could never afford. Recognition for his brilliance. His own lab, with a couple of assistants. And really, as far as he knew, they weren't so bad. There were rumors, yes, but they were mostly a group of Slytherins, and everyone hated them and thought they were pure evil anyways. He brushed those aside.</p>
<p>He went to Albus Dumbledore, to try and get the Defense Against Dark Arts position, as that was an acceptable reward from his superiors. He tried to sneak into get an advantage, and while he heard some bullshit "prophecy" from the other side of the door, he was kicked out by the owner of the establishment in short order. He returned and told everyone the story. For some reason, the Big Man took some interest in it.</p>
<p>He returned to his lab, enjoying his work, the high salary, and within a few years, he could finish paying off the huge debts his father ran up. Life was fine, all in all. That is, until he heard that Lily was being targeted. He asked the Big Man to spare her, but Voldemort was unwilling to commit to anything other than saying he would try. So, he went to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>He became a spy. While she wasn't a friend, Lily had been the only person who had (for at a time) liked him for who he was. She became like everyone, who had just saw in him what he could offer. That meant more than she would ever understand. That was his most important memory - that at one time, someone actually cared.</p>
<p>Teaching was a nightmare. He loved Potions, but the students had no inclination, talent or respect for the subject. He had to be vicious in order to establish ground rules in the classroom. Some people remembered him as a beaten down runt. He had to disabuse them of that notion.</p>
<p>And then she died.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The next few years were a blur. Dumbledore and he knew that Voldemort would return. He learned to relax a bit with his sixth and seventh year students, who had some talent and respect for his subjects, but he could not drop his vicious monster persona. He favored the sons of his "comrades", and despite his disgust with the fact, didn't nurture the muggle-borns. He played up his loathing of Gryffindors. All to prepare for Voldemort's inevitable return.</p>
<p>And then came Harry Potter. No doubt rich and pampered like his parents were. A celebrity for all the wrong reasons - he stole the credit for his mother's sacrifice. And he looked just like James. When he first looked at the boy, he saw him looking back and wincing. The same instinctive hatred his father felt, no doubt. But he decided to give him one chance. If he had read to first chapter of the book, he'd know the answers. Just like Lily did. Perhaps he was her son even if he didn't look it except for his eyes. Of course, he didn't. James and his lazy arrogance all over again.</p>
<p>But those eyes haunted him. Every bad thing that happened in his life could be summed up with those eyes. And just like with Lily, all semblance of emotional control was lost whenever he looked at them. And protecting that little liar, who broke the rules over and again, lied (badly) to cover it up, and had his friends lie for him... and physically assault him for trying to defend the little shit. With the protection of everyone else in the staff, naturally. Of course they would. It was James Potter all over again.</p>
<p>And then, Dumbledore decided to reward the little idiot for his rule breaking. By humiliating Slytherin again. After all those years making Slytherin work together and understand that a single person couldn't beat them united, the headmaster took that away. His house wouldn't recover from this lesson in years to come.</p>
<p>Things got worse, as defense teacher after defense teacher were more incompetent, stupid, or plainly risked the students' lives (Remus Lupin would never give information about Sirius Black, no matter if he could protect the students by doing so). He returned to spying. Of course by then, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin did all they could with their bountiful spare time to make him a pariah in the Order. Really, to expect them to change was too much.</p>
<p>And then Dumbledore went and got himself killed. He tried to save him, but only ended up extending his life. The vicious bastard of a headmaster commanded him to become a murderer. And excused Harry bloody Potter for trying to murder another student, because really, the rules were beneath a Potter. Just a slap on the wrist for him. Some things never change when a Gryffindor tries to murder a Slytherin. No doubt in a few years he would brag about his wonderful "prank".</p>
<p>And then he became a killer. And the most hated man in the world. All to get a chance to protect the children of the school - because if he wouldn't be running the glorified concentration camp the school had become, it would have been Bellatrix and it would become a charnel house. He saved them from the worst of it, and managed to help Potter and his friends from behind the scenes. Getting them the sword, keeping the Death Eaters off their backs, all he could with the information he got from Phineas.</p>
<p>And then, just as he had a chance to complete his mission, get the final bit of information to the ungrateful brat, the rest of the staff decided to revolt. He didn't fight back. He just protected himself and ran. He'd find another chance to get Potter the final piece to Voldemort's fall.</p>
<p>Then, as he had guessed would happen, he finally died. As he got the infomation to Harry, he mused about his life. He failed to protect Lily. He failed to protect her son, who had to die. He never moved out of his home. All of his relationships were disasters, as he could not tell anyone the most important things about his life. He had no family. No friends. His last one, Charity, had begged him to help and he couldn't. He was the most hated man in the world. He would be remembered in history as the murderer of Albus Dumbledore. But finally, he didn't need to prove anything to anyone. It wasn't a happy end. But at least it was an end.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that is the Harry Potter story, from the perspective of Severus Snape.</p>

<p>It was his eighth time being chosen. At this point it had clearly stopped being random. He had friends who had never been picked, however, in the two years since the program had started he had been selected eight times. He knew why. He was good looking, and in the uniform they made him wear when he pressed the buttons that brought the pistons down and pumped the criminal full of fluid that would kill him within minutes, he looked sharp. He looked professional and people watching it all happen on TV liked that. It made them feel like they were watching a movie. He was their Denzel or their Hanks playing his part for the good of humanity. He was their Hector, forever standing in front of the gates protecting them. They cheered him as he eradicated the scum.</p>
<p>But he was done. Every night he went to bed wondering what time it would be when he would wake up in a cold sweat from the nightmares. The overwhelming guilt and sense of wrong had sunk so deep inside him that he was barely able to function. His work suffered, and his boss and coworkers knew, but pushing the button gave him a strange sort of fame so they let him slide. He rarely ate, sleep was impossible. He wasn't even able to get an erection. He had women mailing him their panties, but he was powerless to do anything about it.</p>
<p>His days consisted of going to work then coming home, sitting down on the couch, and staring at the TV until he was nodding off. Then he went to bed, made his guess, and tried to sleep. The only part of his day that he looked forward to was that first few seconds when the alarm went off. His eyes would open and he would fleetingly believe that Anne was still lying in bed next to him and that all was right. Then he would sit up and realize he was alone and it was just another grey day.</p>
<p>But today that was going to change. Today was lucky number eight. He drove to the facility just as he had done the previous seven times. He made small talk with the guards as he put on the uniform. They even joked with him; saying that it was he who should teach the class that showed what order to push the buttons in. They told him where to look in the audience as he carried out the act. He was to look in the direction of the victim’s family. His knowing gaze was a way of telling them that this execution was their personal justice; as if somehow everything would now be okay for them. </p>
<p>He passed on the meal they offered then as time drew near he followed the guards to his position. The curtains opened to reveal the audience and the lights came on. He saw the red light on the camera come to life. They were now live on television. At the prompt the host introduced the prisoner who was strapped to a table and fitted with the correct IV’s. The host told everyone at home what this man’s crimes were and why he was being put to death. Normally at this point his heart would be hammering in his chest and his palms would be sweaty, but today was different. He felt calm. He glanced at the prisoner who locked eyes with him and gave him a pleading look hoping there was something he could do. </p>
<p>He could hear the host as he started the countdown from twenty and stepped out of the room. Everyone was gone. It was just him and the prisoner. As the count hit zero he was to look at the victim’s family and then press the buttons in the correct order. That didn’t happen.</p>
<p>The count hit zero. After a short pause, he stepped away from the buttons and pulled a small knife he had hidden from the guards out of his pocket. He used it to drag a deep cut across his left wrist. Instantly the blood started flowing, cascading onto the white floor like a crimson waterfall. He then gripped the knife with everything he had and drove it into his throat. As he fell to the floor the last thing he saw was the audience. They were in shock. Looks of horror raced across their faces as some screamed in fear and others tried to flee. It was as if they had come to watch an execution and were surprised to see someone die. </p>

<p>It was over twenty years ago when I found the woman of my dreams. However, she never loved me back. I tried desperately for years to get her to enjoy her time with me. I took her on all sorts of special dates-  underwater, in space, in one of my many homes. </p>

<p>When people asked why I’m worth so much, I shrugged. I mean, what am I supposed to say? It’s a question as random as: “why are your eyes blue?” or “how’d you get to be so tall?”. There’s no right way to answer it without bullshitting.</p>
<p>Sure, I could say it’s genetics, but I highly doubt that. My father’s a farmer and is married to a stay-at-home mom. They’re nice people, of course, but nice doesn’t seem to correlate to value. They both barely scratch a hundred thousand dollars combined.</p>
<p>I could say it was a mistake. After all, there wasn’t always an explanation. Most people who did stand out were famous in some facet but every once in a while, a baby was born with an exceptional price. I feel bad for them. They have to live a life of everyone bearing down on them to reach their full potential. I’m just lucky that I’m already in my twenties and a somewhat established carpenter.  It pays the bill and that’s all I need.</p>
<p>That was, until I gained worldwide recognition.</p>
<p>Ever since I’ve been valued at fifty trillion – yes, you read it right – people have been treating me a lot differently. Old friends, past girlfriends, and annoying family members have popped out of the woodwork like crazy to capitalize on my newfound fame. Suddenly, I was desirable because of the unknown. And as far as they knew, it was better to make friends than enemies.</p>
<p>I became the focus of many scientists. They figured if I didn’t have political, monetary, or social power, it must have been something inside me that was unique. A series of tests were run on my body, analyzing every single cell for what makes me tick. The results were a little… <em>unsatisfactory</em>.</p>
<p>Superior athletic ability? Nope.</p>
<p>Cancer-resistant genes? Unfortunately, no.</p>
<p>Unexplainable superpowers? Only in my dreams.</p>
<p>After wearing me to the bone with tests and sucking me dry of blood, they gave up their attempts. As far as they could tell, I was an enigma no one knew how to solve. And at the rate they were going, I was going to be long dead before they made any headway.</p>
<p>Then the paparazzi came into play. Do you know what it’s like being stalked by a gaggle of sleazebags with cameras who have no sense of personal space? I have one word for it – shitty.</p>
<p>Well, one day, I was jogging at the nearby park. In hindsight, it was stupid, but I thought it was safe enough. I never expected them to swarm me like a cloud of bees. But by the time they surrounded me, it was too late to get away.</p>
<p>So I did what any reasonable person would, I sprinted like hell. In fact, I ran so fast that I didn’t even notice I was on a direct course for the pond in front of me. By the time I realized, I already had one foot on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>And then another.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was <em>running</em> on water. It wasn’t a mind-trick, at least not as far as I could tell. I was actually doing it of my own accord.</p>
<p>I turned back to the paparazzi. They were momentarily stunned but started to snap photos again. After all, they had to get the perfect shot. It would be the height of anyone’s career once it reached the tabloids.</p>

<p>Another gigantic hand hammered into John's shoulder, but this time he was ready and did not stumble. The crowd had roared with laughter when Vismar the Red had made Cena almost fall to the floor, as he had "merely" welcomed him with a clap on the back and John had not dared stumble since. </p>
<p>These men, these gigantic men, they loomed over John and slopped their foul smelling alcohol on him as they cheered him and pulled him through the crowd. This was a dream, it must be a dream, but as tightly as he screwed his eyes up, or pinched himself, the world did not go away. </p>
<p>John had always been one of the largest men in the room, but the average height here was approaching seven feet tall and the muscles were hard knots that had been earned by swinging heavy meta, not by pumping iron. it didn't make sense, none of it made sense, he was supposed to be flying to Orlando for a veterans match against Randy, not here, not... wherever he was. </p>
<p>He looked down at his hands again, they were smooth and felt strong, like they had when he was twenty nine and at his physical peak. He flexed his fingers and watched as each muscle in his arm responded in kind, it was... incredible. His body was sculpted, tight, ready to go, he hadn't felt this good in... in decades.</p>
<p><strong><em>"JOHN CENA"</em></strong> The voice boomed across the room and made John's head snap up, he'd barely paid attention to where he was going since his arrival, but now the men in front cleared to the side and made a path. Ahead was a gigantic gilded throne and on it was the most massive man John had ever seen. </p>
<p>The voice was like trucks accelerating in a tunnel, deep, booming and indicating incredible power. <strong><em>"GREETINGS JOHN OF CENA, YOU ARE MUCH WELCOMED HERE IN VALHALLA"</em></strong> </p>
<p>The crowd was suddenly silent and the huge men seemed to be awaiting his response. He smiled weakly. "Okay, hi." There was a moment's pause and the crowd roared in laughter. </p>
<p>On his throne the huge man wiped away a tear and nudged the man nearest him <strong><em>"FORSOOTH! CLASSIC CENA, JUST CLASSIC!"</em></strong> </p>
<p>The men still laughed and John  looked around, confused. "I don't... I don't really get it. What's going on here?" </p>
<p>Finally the laughter subsided and the huge man controlled himself. <strong><em>"VERILY, I AM SORRY JOHN, WE SHOULD NOT LAUGH, BUT WE HAVE FOLLOWED YOU FOR MANY YEARS IN YOUR BATTLES AND... WELL, WE'RE PRETTY HUGE FANS."</em></strong> </p>
<p>This place was getting to him; John slowly turned and took it in. there were faces all around, bright and eager to hear what he had to say, but... they were warrior men, huge leather-bound and covered in scars. He'd come here on a horse with a fat woman and he was in the body he'd owned many year ago. "I'm dead?" </p>
<p>There was a silence and the room was suddenly filled with eyes that would not meet his. <strong><em>"INDEED, I KNOW THAT IT IS HARD FOR A WARRIOR TO ACCEPT, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO VALHALLA MY SON, WHERE THE REWARD FOR A LIFE TIME OF BATTLES IS TO  FEAST AT THE SIDE OF ODIN!"</em></strong> </p>
<p>Slowly things began to make sense to John - this was a gig. He'd seen these expressions day in and day out on the road, wide eyed and excited. These were <em>fans</em> and he was here to perform. Dead, dreaming, it didn't matter, all that mattered was that he was here to entertain. For forty three years John had stepped into the ring and left it all out there and now it was time to do it again. </p>
<p>The crowd had begun to murmur, but silence sharply fell as his hand shot into the air, fingers splayed. With great care, John reached down and deliberately paused, before pumping up his sneakers twice and then jumping to his feet. </p>
<p>"You brought me here to Feast Odin? You think I want to spend me days getting fat and slow? What? You wanna go? I'm here to battle, I'm here to fight, you betta take fright, because I'm Mister Friday Night!" The old words came back easily, the promo flowing as it always had. </p>
<p>Odin leaned over to the man nearest him and whispered excitedly. <strong><em>"THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD, LOOK, HE'S GETTING ALL WORKED UP AND HE'S..."</em></strong> John ripped off his shirt. <strong><em>"OOH, I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DO THAT, I TOTALLY WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY IT."</em></strong> </p>
<p>"Stuff that old man, I came here to <em>get busy</em> and all I see here are a bunch of old men and..." he paused and confusion crept into his voice. "What looks to be my accountant Ted in the corner." Ted waved miserably to John. "So am I gonna get a match or what?" </p>
<p>Odin smiled widely. <strong><em>"INDEED JOHN, WE HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR MANY YEARS. AS ONE OF THE BRAVEST WARRIORS IN EARTH'S HISTORY, WE HAVE PREPARED A MATCH SUITABLE TO YOUR LEVEL."</em></strong> </p>
<p>The crowd parted again and a gigantic man walked forward, over eight feet tall and with muscles bigger than John's head. His sword was nearly five feet long and seemed to split the air with a slight tearing noise. He was bound from head to foot in spiked metal armor, with only his face showing, allowing John to see his scarred face, teeth sharpened to spikes and a demonic smile. </p>
<p>Odin waved his hand casually. <strong><em>"OF COURSE, IT WILL NEED TO BE A BATTLE WITH SOMETHING ON THE LINE, SO WE WILL PIT YOUR IMMORTAL SOUL AGAINST KRATHNAR THE INVINCIBLE'S.

<p><strong><em>"OH DON'T WORRY, HE'S NO UNDERTAKER, JUST PUT ON A QUICK MATCH, BREAK HIM IN TWO AND WE CAN GET TO FEASTING. WATCH OUT FOR THAT SWORD THOUGH, IT'S DAMN SHARP." Odin chuckled. "NOT THAT YOU'LL BE WORRIED I'M SURE."</em></strong></p>
<p>John backed away. "And I don't get a weapon at all?" </p>

<p>Score: 2899</p>
<p>The year was 2026. It had been nearly 2 years since we destroyed the portal between our world and that of those creating the Kaiju clones. The Jaeger program had been largely shut down following the news that the Kaiju’s means of entry into our world had been destroyed, but the units still in existence following The War were kept in cold-storage in the event of Kaiju once again finding a way to our world. A treaty had been signed between all those nations either with Jaeger programs, or those actively supporting them, stating that a defensive pact be made ensuring that in the event of a Kaiju resurgence all international differences be put aside for the survival of the race.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in December of 2026 well over a dozen Kaiju emerged from the ocean on the East coast of America near Maine, far more than had ever been seen at one time. Without any warning the nations of the world were unable to mobilize their Jaegers before the Kaiju started laying waste to cities. Within 24 hours over 500,000 people were dead or missing. Then, an unidentified mech, totally unlike any of the Jaegers developed by any country with active programs, appeared seemingly out of nowhere. This machine’s weapons and defenses were entirely unlike anything developed in any known program; extremely adaptive and energy absorbent hull, and advanced energy weapons including particle beams, matter displacement arrays, high-explosive flechette rounds, and a monstrously powerful plasma weapon with an ordinance close to 8,000 kilotons and a range of several miles. This giant, although only around 50 meters tall as compared to Cherno Alpha or Coyote Tango’s 85 meters, put up one of the most one-sided fights we had ever seen against any Kaiju, let alone that many. The world stood in awe of this beast, easily the most advanced piece of weaponry known to mankind.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, America had met this machine nearly 70 years ago, in 1958. It had “gone rogue” in a small Maine town, laying waste to the large military detachment sent in response to its discovery, and was subsequently destroyed with nuclear ordinance. This was passed off as a test firing internationally. The re-emergence of the “Iron Giant”, as it had come to be called, was a massive shock to the US government. There was some belief that this was not the same machine, but a similar model, but upon dispatching the Kaiju it began asking for someone named “Hogarth”.  The name was tracked down to be Hogarth Hughes, a 77 year old man living in the same small town as the original “Iron Giant” encounter. Unfortunately, one of the earlier Kaiju attacks targeted this town and Hogarth was never found. Upon hearing this news the “Iron Giant” went into a rage and dove deep into the Atlantic off the coast of Maine. Probes sent to the newly opened portal reported seeing the machine entering it with all weapons active. 28 hours later the portal closed.</p>
<p>It has been nearly 30 years since the “Iron Giant” closed the portal, and not once has there been any sign of the Kaiju or their creators. </p>
<p>Wherever you are Iron Giant, the hearts of Humanity go out to you.</p>

<h1>[EU] Harry Potter is sitting at home sixty years after the battle of Hogwarts, an old man now, when suddenly his scar hurts.</h1>
<p>Score: 2801</p>
<p>Harry sat alone. The house that once housed  Ginny and his children was near empty. Ginny had passed a year ago, and he had to admit it had taken something out of him. He had lost so many people, but this had struck him hard. </p>
<p>He thought of his children. They all had families of their own, and they were supposed to be visiting soon. He sighed.</p>
<p>No one knew he was sick. Ron knew, but he made him swear on his life not to tell anyone. He'd had a good life, and he wanted to go without a fuss. Enough close brushes with death had made him want to go quietly.</p>
<p>He wanted some tea, but he felt too weak to get up. He took out his wand, then stopped. He held the old, etched wood in his hands, then lightly made sparks fly out of the tip.</p>
<p>He smiled. He always loved how still, so many years later, magic still amazed him. </p>
<p>Suddenly, his scar hurt. </p>
<p>He wasn't alarmed by it, nor by the man who had appeared in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>It was Tom Riddle. Not snake-like, pale, and red-eyed. Human. He smiled, not menacingly, but warmly.</p>
<p>"Hello, Harry."</p>
<p>Harry smiled as well. "Nice to see you again, Tom."</p>
<p>"Is it nice? I was never much of a warm presence when I was among the living. I hurt many people. But most of all, I tried to hurt you. It's ironic that you were among the few who saw me as Tom Riddle, rather than Lord Voldemort."</p>
<p>"Fear can drive you mad," said Harry. "I've seen it many times."</p>
<p>Tom Riddle smiled again, somewhat sadly. "Harry, we've got to go."</p>
<p>Harry looked at him. There were tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I'm scared." he said.</p>
<p>"I know." said another voice.</p>
<p>Harry turned. It was Ginny. He gasped.</p>
<p>Behind her stood every person he had ever loved and lost. Hagrid, and Dumbledore, and  Dobby, and Lupin and Tonks and Snape and Cedric and Sirius and even the Dursleys. His parents stood next to Ginny, smiling. </p>
<p>"We're with you, Harry." his mother said softly.</p>
<p>Harry turned to Riddle.</p>
<p>Tom stuck out his hand. "Come, Harry."</p>
<p>Harry laughed, tears in his eyes, his scar burning, as he grabbed Riddle's hand, and then left this world together with Death, as equals.</p>

<h1>[WP] a prompt for bad people</h1>
<p>Score: 2740</p>
<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary<br />
Over many a quaint an curious volume of forgotten lore<br />
While I nodden nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping<br />
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br />
'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door -<br />
Only this, and nothing more.'</p>
<p>But still came that incessant knocking, no more could my ease keep blocking<br />
Out this rapping loudly stalking, louder now than 'twas before<br />
Failing to return the silence, hesitation turned compliance<br />
Anything to stop the violence thrust upon my chamber door<br />
"Who is there," I asked the darkness, safely from behind the door.<br />
"Who should keep me from my snore?"</p>
<p>No reply, but knocking fading, still my listening, still my waiting<br />
Curiosity abating, every second lessened more<br />
"Who?" once more my question ringing,  may I catch a response bringing<br />
Just whose hand by now is stinging from the banging on my door<br />
Still no answer, just the gusting from the raging winter storm<br />
I returned to think some more</p>
<p>Again came that infernal clatter, "Dear sir what could be the matter?"<br />
Would this person once more scatter as I walk the foyer floor<br />
No more for a reply waiting, time to start investigating<br />
Courage then in me inflating, time to find out what's in store<br />
To the rapping now we add the creaking of the chamber door<br />
Behind, the visage of Lenore</p>
<p>"It's you," I cried as tears were falling. "I hadn't known, did you try calling?"<br />
Realizing I'd been stalling, I asked her inside where it's warm<br />
Slowly she begins her entry, after what seems like a century<br />
Still I'm standing like a sentry, shaken right down to my core<br />
Having shed her mortal coil, yet she stood there as before<br />
Again I see my lost Lenore</p>
<p>"Be you ghost, or haunting spirit? Answer though I know I'll fear it<br />
Please, the answer let me hear it. What's your fate now?" I implore<br />
Only silence for a second, then the appararition beckoned<br />
The risks of contact by then reckoned, how I had to know the score<br />
Had to know the spirit's fate, what chains of bondage that she wore<br />
'Til death' to her my oath I swore</p>
<p>The slap came quick across my face, another close behind in chase<br />
The pain had trouble keeping pace, my cheeks quite soon were rather sore<br />
"I didn't die you stupid twat, I left you in case you forgot<br />
I shacked up with that stupid Scot who own the townhouse right next door.<br />
I'm only here to take the trinkets sitting in my dresser drawer."<br />
Oh yes, that's right, she was a whore.</p>

<h1>[WP] A new invention enables people to remember their dreams with absolute clarity. It turns out we were forgetting them for a very good reason.</h1>
<p>Score: 2649</p>
<p>My name is Liam and It's been four months since I last dreamed.<br />
A lot of people set their alarms to wake up throughout the night, sleeping in half hour bursts, other people sleep in shifts, watching each other.  I take Myclocin.  Dreamless sleep.  I have a good job and make good money so I get the pills.  Others, aren't so lucky.  </p>
<p>Last year some Chinese company invented a machine that lets you remember dreams with total clarity.  I mean down to the details man.  No ambiguity, crystal clear memories of amazing landscapes and experiences.<br />
It became THE Christmas gift.  Then you could record your dreams and upload them to youtube.  And that's when things started to fall apart, that's when we started to notice them.</p>
<p>We'd never noticed them before.  I think it's because in your dreams you're always focused on the doing.  Taking that exam, driving that car, fucking that girl.  We've never really paused and looked around the same way you might do on a Sunday morning walk.  But they were there, they'd always been there, standing in the background, silently watching us.  Holes instead of eyes, long fingers, teeth...fuck, so many teeth.</p>
<p>Maybe we did notice them thousands of years ago, way back when we were still lived in caves, maybe that's where our Gods and monsters came from.  Maybe we evolved to forget them, muddled dreams gave them a camouflage to hide behind.  But not any more.  We saw them standing in the background and edges in our dreams and everyone else's.  I thought it was one of those internet memes at first, like slenderman or something.  People with too much time on their hands photoshopping their dreams for cheap likes and shares.</p>
<p>But they were real, and when we finally noticed them they started to notice us.  They stepped out of the peripheral, reached out with those long, grey, cold fingers and....took people.</p>
<p>I know we won't last, we can't fight them, turning off the machines did nothing.  People queued, fucking queued up in lines on the edges of buildings and bridges like they were waiting for a bus to come and take them away.  Instead they jumped, the roads and canals were full of red-black carnage every morning.  </p>
<p>So we don't dream.  We wake each other up, or we take turns, we drink coffee like it was water, we inject, we pop pills, anything to stop us from dreaming.</p>
<p>But it hasn't worked, I can feel my mind unraveling like so many others before me.  I need to get some natural sleep.  I need to dream.  But I don't dare.  I'd gladly give up food and water if I could dream and give my brain what it needs.  Instead I stare into my computer screen trying to remember what I was trying to do.  I don't trust myself behind the wheel of my car.  I walk everywhere now, a stumbling, mindless walk like everyone else.<br />
We look like a zombie apocalypse shuffling from place to place.</p>
<p>People have started to hallucinate.  Not so much from sleep deprivation but dream deprivation, and some people just...snap.  Some old lady in town just went for it out of the blue, no one was shocked.  We watched her run into the street screaming, desperately trying to get hit by a car.  She'd managed to gouge out one of her eyes before she was hit.  Fuck knows what she was seeing.  I helped drag her out of the road, her mashed up eye in one clawed hand.  We said nothing.</p>
<p>The hallucinations are bad but what's worse is...I think They can...I think They're starting to come through now into the real world.  I guess any dream is enough for them, even a hallucination.</p>
<p>I saw the first two this morning.  Behind me in the bathroom mirror while I was brushing my teeth, two long-limbed pale faced...things.  Watching me with those holes instead of eyes.  Yawning mouths full of needle thin teeth.</p>
<p>Four months to get to this point.  And I just can't let them take me.  But I can't go on.  </p>
<p>The line is efficient.  We shuffle forwards.  Some people scream on the way down, most don't.  I think it's because they're happy.  Happy to finally sleep without dreams.</p>

<h1><a href="NSFW">WP</a> The world has moved on from nature documentaries, leaving many narrators out of a job. These men and women turn to a new field; narrating pornography.</h1>
<p>Score: 2633</p>
<p>Human mating, once a thing of beauty and mystery, has been reduced to a science by these clever experts. Like the majestic bird of paradise, the seduction ritual follows very clear and often complicated steps, depending on the particular variety. Our subject today is the common "Lemon-stealing whore." Though she adopts a somewhat unusual strategy, her tactics are quite successful. Let's watch!</p>
<p>The ritual begins not with an attempt to show off her ample busom or other physical features, as one might expect. This unusual adaptation seems to have evolved due to an over-saturation of competition from other women with more appealing aesthetics. The LSW instead gains attention by rather brusquely entering the male's territory and attempting to pilfer food directly from the male's home. The instinctive defense mechanism kicks in, allowing the Whore to bypass the complicated ritual attempting to gain the man's attention. This clever young lady has no need for such deceptive practices as 'hiring a plumber' or 'ordering a pizza.' She draws the male directly to her by threatening its food source! Ingenious!</p>
<p>Once the male has been sufficiently placated and the food returned, the female <em>then</em> attempts to turn the male's attention to more sexual acts. The male, with his naturally short attention span, completely forgets all about her past indiscretions in attempting to rob him of his sour citrus treasures, and willingly consents to copulation. From this point onward, it is up to the female to <em>maintain</em> his attention and bring him to coitus. The LSW does this through the use of a variety of sexual positions, exaggerated moaning, and contorted facial expressions in an attempt to trick the male into believing that she's really enjoying it.</p>
<p>At long last, the act is almost completed. Now comes the most difficult challenge for the LSW: the male will attempt to perform a maneuver known as 'pulling out,' so that he can avoid impregnating the female and thus keep all of the lemons for himself. The male will, however, attempt to 'claim' the woman as part of his harem by marking her face with his seed. This is a compromise result for the two, as the LSW is at least assured that he will attempt to copulate in the future. Let's see if she can manage to... Oh! So close! She didn't quite manage to keep him inside of her for long enough, and he has now established ownership of her with this 'cumshot' signature.</p>
<p>But alas, that is the way of cruel nature. At least we can rest assured knowing that she has gotten further than most females, and his sperm on her face is a promise that she can try again tomorrow!</p>
<p>I hope you all have enjoyed this tremendous display of erotic acrobatics, and I sincerely hope that you will tune in tomorrow for our special on the flock-like nature of the bukkake participant!</p>

<p>The day he opened the box was the day his carefully woven lifestyle had fallen apart. He remembered it like yesterday, thinking back to that little purple package, tied with a bow and delivered to his door like he was being sent cookies. He recalled with a wry smile and a sigh how easily the rules he'd built had come crashing down. </p>
<hr />
<p>"Two." </p>
<p>"Two!? I'd been told it was one...y-you sure?"</p>
<p>"You were misinformed. The price is two." </p>
<p>"Two hundred grand? You better be good."</p>
<p>The man laughed into the receiver, a deep chuckle that died softly almost as soon as it had begun.</p>
<p>"I'm the <em>best</em>."</p>
<p>Rule one: Don't ever sell yourself cheap. </p>
<p>Another day, another phonecall. The man shook his head as he hung up the payphone. He liked to take calls at payphones - in an age of convenience and, more importantly, surveillance, a payphone was an innocuous choice and it meant people were rarely late. If he told them to call <em>x</em> payphone at <em>n</em> time, they'd call. Rule two: Be careful and precise.</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette in the phonebooth, dark sunglasses letting him observe the crowds rushing around the busy city centre. To him, they looked like ants, scurrying around with their busy lives. To him, any normal life was a thing to be observed, critiqued, mocked. </p>
<p>His own life was far simpler. Or more complex, depending on the angle you viewed it from. His working life was about completion. His targets and bonuses were around one goal. His 9-5 about training, stalking, executing. Rule three: Research and know your target. </p>
<p>His business was death, and business was good.</p>
<p>The hitman had been doing this for a long time. Long enough to know there is a price on every man's head. Long enough to know that no one dies for free. Long enough to be the best, or one of them. Which meant, of course, his price was high. Two hundred thousand dollars a hit, rising in doubles for riskier or higher profile targets. </p>
<p>He had killed doctors, lawyers, lovers, fighters, escorts, strippers, judges, policemen, politicians, leaders. One thing was the same. He had never killed a man for less than his price. <em>At least</em>, he thought, <em>not since the first.</em>  </p>
<p>He'd been an ex-military washout, desperate for work. He'd looked everywhere, travelling state to state in an attempt to pick up jobs as a security guard or bodyguard. Overnight stays in shanty towns and campsites, rubbing shoulders with the homeless and the degenerate. Things had gotten desperate, and a man had tried to take his food. That was his first kill. He'd gotten him in his sleep. No one suspected a thing. Another man had been his rival, and paid the hitman a hundred dollars. That was his first hit, and ever since his price had been high. </p>
<p>Then he'd found it. </p>
<p>It was simple really. Laughably so. On one of his many properties there was a small purple box wrapped like a cartoon gift, a pink ribbon bow tied around the top. Left on the doorstep of the back porch. At first, the hitman had been tempted to throw it away. It could have been a bomb, a deterrent, a threat. Anything. </p>
<p>But for some reason, some insane reason, he'd taken it inside. </p>
<p>He couldn't have told you why. He couldn't have told himself why. The obscenely cutesy gift, a child-like idea of what a gift should look like. It sat on his metallic table worktop, garishly out of place amongst the guns and knives littered in his apartment. </p>
<p>He'd opened it after some consideration, his fingers neatly undoing the bow and chuckling at the care someone had put into this. Perhaps it was because he'd never received a gift, merely saw them in cartoons. Perhaps it was the feeling it gave him: an excited, giddy rise in his belly that threatened to compromise everything he'd worked so hard to contain.</p>
<p>Inside had been a note, handwritten in the untidy scrawlings of a child. Alongside the note was a crumpled ten dollar bill and coins. He added them up slowly. They totalled $13.42. Added to the scruffy bill that was just over twenty dollars. He laid out the money on the table and turned back to the note.</p>
<p><em>Mister</em> It said.
<em>I think you can help me i have a problem and i think you can help me</em>
The hitman looked around, his empty apartment chilly. He almost felt embarrassed to be reading the note. It was as if eyes were on him, knowing his lizard-like slits should not be cast across something as innocent as a child's note. Almost guiltily, he continued.
<em>My daddy is a bad man. He hurts my mommy and he hurts me some nights he comes in my room and he tells me he loves me and hurts me in the bad way. mommy cries alot. she tells me well run away but then he always comes back.</em></p>
<p><em>Mister. I live near you and ive seen you soemtimes. i know u hide but ive seen your guns.</em></p>
<p><em>Please mister. I saved all my money that mommy tries to give me. my daddy takes it away to buy more bottles but i hided some.</em> </p>
<p><em>Please mister my daddy needs to go away. he says he is gonna kill my mommy and ill be his new woman when i growed up. he says hes gonna put a baby in me but thats silly im a kid i cant have a baby. i dont want a baby mister.</em></p>
<p><em>here is all my money mister. i know you make people disappereah. please make my daddy disappere.</em></p>
<p><em>we live at 31 Oakfelt drive, autumn boulevard. daddy comes home late every night and works in the city. he is a teacher.</em></p>
<p>The hitman put the letter down, blinking back tears. He traced the lazy scrawl of the girls handwriting with the tip of his finger, imagining her writing it. Desperate, rushed. It would have been neater, he could tell, if she'd not been so afraid. The dots were absent, the curvature of her writing tilted right down as though she'd been writing flat-out. Against the clock, sort to speak. </p>
<p>She was against the clock, he understood that. She was probably waiting for him to visit her room again, her tiny body shaking in fear as she wrote this plea to him. </p>
<p>He shook his head, sitting down on his leather sofa. It had cost him ten thousand dollars, that sofa. A luxury easily afforded due to his rules. Rule one: Don't sell yourself cheap. A life was worth two hundred grand, minimum. </p>
<p>He thought of her letter. He picked it back up and looked at it for a long time, staring at the foot of the page. </p>
<p><em>Love from Melissa.</em></p>
<p><em>P.s dont worry i wont tell. i dont want a daddy anyway. daddys are mean</em></p>
<p>The hitman found his fist clenching, the paper crumpling in his hand. Tears gathered in his face and he stared at the last few words, hastily scribbled out by the girl. He noticed dark blotches on the paper, where tears had fallen and been stained forever into the sheet.</p>
<p>He thought back to his own father, a ghost of a man who was neither here nor there, ever-scornful and frightening but so often absent that the man had grown old thinking his father might have been imagined, rather than real.</p>
<p>He thought back to this desperate little girl, scrounging scraps of change to try and pay him. </p>
<p>Rule number one: Don't sell yourself cheap. </p>
<p>A kill might have been worth two hundred grand to the hitman he thought to himself. But, as he sat and read the note one last time, <em>some kills are worth more than money.</em></p>
<p>No more rule number one. This time, the job cost $23.42. This time, the job would be worth that young girl's life. </p>
<hr />

The doctor is giving me a run down of what will happen when we pull the plug. It will be painless, he says. Despite his reassurance, I can't help but be afraid. I glance over to my wife, my one true happiness in life, and begin to tear up. I can't handle the fact that I will never see her again. I pull her in for one last embrace.<br />
I look back at the doctor and tell him I'm ready.<br />

<h1>[WP] You live in a city full of people with powers (telekinesis, electro kinesis, sensors, etc) and everyone is ranked according to how powerful they but they can kill someone of higher rank and obtain their rank. You are rank #1 but no one knows what your power is</h1>
<p>Score: 2516</p>
<p>Everyone has these tags.  These little buttons on their shirts with a number on it.  Some in the hundreds, some in the thousands.  Mine is number 1.</p>
<p>Pretty quickly people started to figure out that when someone else died, everyone with a lower number moved up.  There wasn’t really much that this meant for the higher numbers, but for the lower numbers it was a bloodbath.  The higher numbers started by trying to kill the numbers above themselves, but there was a reason for the rankings.  5 fell to 3.  3 fell to 2.  Only number 17 managed to kill number 16, and even then it was with 18’s help.  He still wound up hooked to a machine for the short time he managed to live.  </p>
<p>Eventually they realized the better plan was to start killing the numbers lower than you.  2 killed 3-15, then 16 moves up, turns to 3.  That 3 kills 4-73, 74 moves up and becomes 4.  That 4 kills… and on and on.  It led to huge gaps in power between the top ten.  For all that time, nobody set their sights on me.  I’m number one.  Of course I am the strongest.  Far and away.  What can I do?  Only a handful of people ever knew, and that’s all they are now, a handful.  At least that’s what I tell people.  Reality is always such a letdown.   </p>

<h1>[WP] When teenagers turn 17, they are sent a slip of paper with their future occupation written on it. Yours says, "Princeps de Nova Roma" or "First Citizen of New Rome."</h1>
<p>Score: 2506</p>
<p>I had no outstanding qualifications.</p>
<p>I wasn’t the strongest (that was Gard), and I most certainly wasn’t the most clever (that would be Art). I wasn’t the most popular (Priya), I wasn’t the wisest (Edem), I wasn’t the most enduring (Martin), and I definitely wasn’t the most charismatic (Yennefer). </p>
<p>As far as I could tell, I had nothing going for me—but the Senate disagreed.</p>
<p>And on September 17th, 104 A.E., I got the slip that would call me Prime of our new world.</p>
<p>They told me the training would last ten years.</p>
<hr />
<p>“<em>Shit!</em>” I cried. That last one hurt. “Why does the Princeps have to do this, anyway?”</p>
<p>My first tutor was a stern man named Abattoir Singh, bald to his crown, with wrinkles so deep they looked like scars—or scars so deep they looked like wrinkles. It was difficult to tell.</p>
<p>He rapped the back of my knees with his staff and brought me to the floor.</p>
<p>“How can you hope to rule over Nova Roma if you cannot rule your own body?”</p>
<p>I tried getting up and he lashed out again. “<em>Shit!</em>”</p>
<p>“Watch your tongue, boy.” He rested the staff on his shoulder and gave me a squint. “If you suffer you must do it in <em>silence.</em> Anything more is weakness.”</p>
<p>I grit my teeth and tried to stand, and he got me in the nerve cluster in my thigh.</p>
<p>I swallowed a cry of pain and said, “You know who’d really like this? Gard Inura. Strongest guy I know.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps I’ll make an appeal to bring <em>him</em> here instead. For now I’ll have to do with you.”</p>
<p>Another hit, this time to the gut.</p>
<hr />
<p>My second tutor went by the title of Mind Above.</p>
<p>Nobody knew his real name, as far as I could tell.</p>
<p>I thought I’d be sitting in a stuffy classroom and going over old histories with him, but the very first day he put a wooden sculpture on my desk, all knotted and pieced together in complex twists and turns, and he told me: “Take this apart.”</p>
<p>Then he sat quietly at his desk. </p>
<p>I tried removing a section and sliding out a branch of wood, but that just made taking out the other side impossible. I tried sliding it to the middle and wriggling free the metal stopper at a crossbar, but then I couldn’t slide the piece free right below.</p>
<p>“This is pretty hard,” I said to him.</p>
<p>He stayed silent.</p>
<p>“There’s a person named Art Grimaldi who would have a field day with this.”</p>
<p>He stayed silent.</p>
<p>After about an hour I tried wrenching some of the wood pieces free, looking for the weakest seams.</p>
<p>He called from his desk absentmindedly, “This is a test of intelligence, not strength…”</p>
<p>I turned my eye back on the puzzle. This was going to take a while. </p>
<hr />
<p>I had five other tutors. </p>
<p>Old Graeme, who taught me History, Forktongue Creak, who taught me diplomacy, Builder Bronn, who taught me fine construction, Wireful Lin, who taught me the sciences, and last but not least, Stone George.</p>
<p>I didn’t know <em>what</em> he was supposed to teach me.</p>
<p>When I entered his classroom he didn’t acknowledge me. He simply sat in his cross-legged pose like a statue, and burned a hole into the wall with his stare.</p>
<p>I sat across from him, eager for whatever trick he had in store for me.</p>
<p>Surely this was some test of patience, so I sat and I waited.</p>
<p>After a half hour of fidgeting I asked, “So, what exactly are we meant to do here?”</p>
<p>No response, so we sat some more. </p>
<p>Another hour passed. I wasn’t allowed to leave the presence of a tutor until he dismissed me, so I stayed and I sat, leaned against a pillow and picked at the threads. </p>
<p>Another hour. </p>
<p>And then he finally spoke, like gravel on gravel.</p>
<p>“For breakfast you ate a meal of pease and porridge, you then went for a sparring match with Tutor Singh, before resting in the grove of the Tree of the World. For lunch you visited the cart of Anjali Leyeron, before walking up the long trail around Edd Creek before arriving in my home.”</p>
<p>I was stunned.</p>
<p>All of that, to a tee… was correct. “How did you know all that?”</p>
<p>“I sat silent and paid attention to the story written upon you, your clothes, your body.” His eyes flicked down for a moment. “Your boots were caked in dirt of three parts: the first layer from the fighting sands, the second from the soft earth of the planter’s gardens, the third from the rocky trail. I could smell Anjali’s spices on your breath—and I could see the spot of porridge left on your shirt.” He didn’t blink. “If you sit still and cease to be a teller of stories in the world, Nova Roma will treat you as a <em>listener</em>, and tell you everything there is to tell.”</p>
<p>I gulped.</p>
<p>Then he said, “Now, what can you tell me about me?”</p>
<p>I scrambled and looked around the room. “Well, you’ve been sitting here all day, and, uh…” There were old sandalwood candles burning in alcoves, a pair of shoes aligned next to the back door, and a bowl at a table, “And, you only had one meal, you prayed to The God early in the morning, before going on a morning walk around Edd Creek.”</p>
<p>He shook his head no. “A few observations without the context of the whole are nigh useless. You must learn to look at the whole, and the whole takes <em>time</em>. And <em>time</em> requires patience. Understand?”</p>
<p>I nodded, knowing that Edem Abril would have caught onto this game in a second. I felt so <em>wrong</em> being here.</p>
<p>Stone George closed his eyes and let loose a groan like a chasm after a quake.</p>
<p>“You are dismissed.”</p>
<hr />
<p>I could deal with the Mind Above’s puzzles a lot better now. He’d set them down and I could tease them apart in mere minutes.</p>
<p>“You’ve certainly improved,” he said.</p>
<p>I smiled and went through another four.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it’s time to graduate to a more difficult fare.” He swept aside the puzzles and set down a game board with red and blue squares, and pieces every color of the rainbow.</p>
<p>He sat opposite me and moved a piece.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you even going to tell me the rules?”</p>
<p>“After you exit the womb, did <em>life</em> tell you <em>its</em> rules?”</p>
<p>I shook my head no, and moved a piece. It went on like this for some time, while I tried to discern a pattern.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why I’m here.”</p>
<p>Mind Above remained silent.</p>
<p>“I could list a thousand names that would be better suited to this position than I am. Why me?”</p>
<p>Mind Above spoke without looking at me. “That’s a puzzle, is it not? And here I thought I had already taught you to solve those.”</p>
<p>I leaned back in my chair, straining to follow the movement of the pieces around the board.</p>
<hr />
<p>A year passed, and the next generation of children received their slips.</p>
<p>My little brother received Magistrate, to which he was well suited. Bryce’s sister Elizabeth was set to become a healer, which was also quite fitting, I believed.</p>
<p>The Senate had a knack for choosing exactly the right person for the job…</p>
<p>So why did I feel so out of place?</p>
<p>I sat in the square and pondered, as all the children received their new vocations.</p>
<p>What was the current Princeps doing in his House on the Hill? Did he engage in combat, after a lifetime of training with Abattoir Singh? Was he constantly assaulted by puzzles and odd games? Did he have to recount history? Did he travel for diplomacy, or did he build?</p>
<p>I waited like Stone George, and absorbed all that I could around me.</p>
<p>What kept this city running…?</p>
<hr />
<p>My next bout with Abattoir Singh went fast and furious, and I disarmed him with a masterful three stroke assault on the wrist.</p>
<p>He smiled. “You’re certainly feeling more alive in your skin, boy.”</p>
<p>I knew that.</p>
<p>When I went to sit with Stone George I stopped and listened to everything his room was telling me. Every day he’d do something more and more elaborate for me to figure out, and every day I could determine what it was with ease.</p>
<p>“You milked the cows at ten in the morning, returned here for a nap, ate a concoction of yuzu and fire fruit, went into Threepiece Forest for a swim in the waterfall, returned here to beat an indentation in the seat to make it seem as if you sat for hours, and here we are.”</p>
<p>He nodded sagely. “I sense you have become more confident in your station here, young one.”</p>
<p>That was true.</p>
<p>In my session with Mind Above, I beat him in the rainbow game with a five pronged strategy led by two centurions, a common legionnaire, a general, and the colored piece that represented myself.</p>
<p>“You’re certainly bolder than you’ve been before. Finally settling into being Princeps, I see.”</p>
<p>“It was just a matter of figuring out what it’s really all about.”</p>
<p>“And that is?”</p>
<p>“All of these skills are auxiliary. Fighting, strategizing, learning my histories, observing. The tutors are here because the Princeps is never expected to be a natural master of these fields.”</p>
<p>“Go on.”</p>
<p>“My whole first year here I knew that Gard or Art or Priya or a dozen other people could have excelled in the areas where I was struggling—but then I realized, <em>their</em> skills aren't what keep this city running.”</p>
<p>“And what keeps this city running?”</p>
<p>“The slips," I said. "Everyone needs to know what they’re going to be. And I can tell their strengths and weaknesses in an instant. The Princeps isn’t a fighter, or a diplomat. He lives in his House on the Hill… and he writes the slips.”</p>
<p>Mind Above removed the game pieces and smiled. </p>
<p>"It seems you've learned something here, after all."</p>
<p>And then he set down another board, bigger and far more complex.</p>

<h1>[WP] You're on your death bed, and the personification of your greatest regret has come to say goodbye.</h1>
<p>Score: 2467</p>
<p>A stranger has come to visit me. She says she is family, but I have no family. No wife, no children, no parents, no siblings. I've never laid eyes on her before. Nonetheless, I can't deny our connection. She has my clear grey eyes and ginger hair and the same distinctive jawline and cheekbones. And moreover, the tenderness with which she treats me in my fragile state, clinging to this world by a thread, says more than appearances ever could. She is sorry she never had the chance to see me before and she sheds a tear at seeing me in this state, and the gentle warmth of her hand round mine is all the comfort in the world. </p>
<p>She tells me about her life. Her happy family childhood back in my old home town, after I'd already left. The success she'd enjoyed at college, buoyed up by the support from her father telling her that hard work would bring such rewards. The hard lessons she'd learnt in love and the joy she'd won in return when she discovered what was right for her. Whatever my conservative views, I could feel her joy when she described falling in love with a woman for the first time and my antipathy towards that lifestyle was swept away by the smile on her face. </p>
<p>She asked me about my life. My sorry childhood didn't match up to hers, raised with the fear of hell and beatings that left me always battling to prove myself as an adult. When I left for university it was a weight released, but the discipline stood me in good stead. My self-control won me awards, a career that from the first day supported me, the girl I loved, our dream wedding and home and everything she and I wanted. But then my need to prove myself took everything away. When I was offered my dream job on the other coast, she wouldn't come. Her family and friends meant more to her than me. She wanted me to decline it, but I saw that as failure. She stayed and I went and we tossed our marriage away. </p>
<p>I threw myself into my career to numb the pain, and my success was tremendous, but with no one to make happy with it, the shine was gone. Woman after woman came into my life and left but I never found love again. Looking into this stranger's eyes, I can see my ex-wife's love for me shining through and what I've known for years comes flooding out in tears - I walked away from the best thing I could ever have had. </p>
<p>She cradles me close as the regret consumes me. I blink through my tears and ask her, <em>what if? What if I'd stayed? I could've been so happy. I could've had the world.</em> I wish I'd realised then what was of true value, as I do now. Here I am, alone, with only a stranger to see me through my darkest, final night.</p>
<p>She wipes away my tears with gentle fingers. <em>The world,</em> she whispers, <em>and more. Your wife would have loved you more each day. And you could have had me, dad. You could have had me.</em></p>

<p><em>“Right. About that...”</em> He smiled and it was like watching a crack form in the glacial north arctic. Every time he did it you just knew that some polar bear was getting his life screwed over. <em>“Turns out,”</em> he said, with that same smile, <em>“that your little eight year-old fantasy may not be so useless after all.”</em></p>
<p>I turned around and started locking up the drawers. I was closing up the coffee shop tonight. “Get to the point, Devil.”</p>

<p>“Of course I have. I’m not an idiot.”</p>
<p>He shrugged. <em>”I can never really tell with you mortals. Anyway, you’re going to need to get on this,”</em> he traced air quotes with his fingers, <em>“‘space-station’, and then you’re going to retrieve my little item. Think you can do that?”</em></p>
<p>No, of course I didn’t think I could do that. But this was my immortal soul we were talking about, here. How could I do anything less than try? “Sure, I think I can do that. How do I get there?”</p>
<p><em>”Well, you’re going to take a worm tube to your launch point, first. Wouldn’t want you to have to worry about all the niggly aspects of interstellar travel that ain’t instantaneous, you know?”</em></p>
<p>“Where’s the tube?”</p>
<p><em>“Where’s the…?”</em> He laughed and held up something suspiciously like a detonator. He put on his best Wizard of Oz voice and boomed, <em>“The tube was always inside you! The tube was always…!”</em></p>
<p>Then he clicked the button and the world faded through white.</p>
<hr />
<p>I didn’t stop throwing up for what felt like hours.</p>
<p>When I could finally look up, a horned face looked down at me with angry red eyes. The Devil usually cleaned himself up, but it looked like his underling demons didn’t really give a shit if they looked like the combined result of a halloween bargain bin and the nightmares of a toddler.</p>
<p>His voice was gruff. “You are ’Gabe’?”</p>
<p>I spit the taste of vomit out of my mouth. “Yeah, that’s me.”</p>
<p>He snorted. “Come with me.” </p>
<p>I followed his spiny back through a pair of airlocks, a de-licing room—“You kidding me, fellas? I don’t have lice!”—a decontamination room, and finally, a prep room.</p>
<p>Hornface pointed at a locker. “Suit is in there. Put it on, get ready.”</p>
<p>He watched me intently. </p>
<p>I cleared my throat, “Uh, not going to give me some privacy, here?”</p>
<p>“Why you need privacy?”</p>
<p>“I’m about to get naked, bud.”</p>
<p>“So? I am also naked.”</p>
<p>He… had kind of a point. I wasn’t going to press the issue, so I got out of my clothes, slipped into an undersuit, and worked my way into the outer hard-shelled carapace.</p>
<p>It all came so easy. Like I’d been doing this for decades. </p>
<p>Hornface grunted. “Ready now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah.” I did final seal checks and gave my helmet a good knock for good luck. “Where are we headed now?”</p>
<p>“Your ship.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The space-ship was something only a hellspawn could have devised. It was covered in what looked like volcanic rock, with glowing orange rivulets running hot in the contours and gothic spikes thrusting up off the hull like undersea vents.</p>
<p>“Really, guys? Not even thinking about aerodynamics here, huh?”</p>
<p>Hornface shrugged. “No air in space. If no aerodynamics, why not make look cool?”</p>
<p>“You know, Hornface, you’re really not as stupid as you sound.”</p>
<p>He scowled. “English not first language. Maybe you try speaking in Tongues?” </p>
<p>The demon spoke fluent gibberish for a good half minute before I said, “Yeah, maybe not.”</p>
<p>He pushed me towards the cockpit and said, “You go now. Computer tell you what do.”</p>
<p>Uh-huh. I jumped into the cockpit and it locked closed around me. The thing was shot through with a diffuse orange glow.</p>
<p>“Um. Computer?”</p>
<p>The console came alive with red light, and there was a voice: “WHAT DO YOU WANT, PEASANT?”</p>
<p>“Jesus, computer. Lighten up.”</p>
<p>“LIGHTENING UP IS NOT IN MY PROGRAMMING. STATE YOUR REQUEST, FOOL.”</p>
<p>Just like the Devil to give me a ship that berates me. What a dick.</p>
<p>“Start up nav for this space station I’m supposed to get on.”</p>
<p>“BE POLITE AND PERHAPS I WILL DO THIS.”</p>
<p>“Start up nav, <em>please.</em>” Fucking computer.</p>
<p>“PERFORMING AS REQUESTED. BRACE FOR ACCELERATION.”</p>
<p>I tried to ‘brace for acceleration’, I really did. But instead I got my teeth rattled so hard you could have sworn I was playing the maracas.</p>
<hr />
<p>After a good half hour of having my body smushed up against the seat, the computer finally said:</p>
<p>“YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT YOUR DESTINATION.”</p>
<p>Thank fucking God.</p>
<p>“NOW RETURNING MANUAL CONTROL. GOOD LUCK WITH EVASIVE MANEUVERS.”</p>
<p>Wait, <em>what?</em> Two joysticks flipped up from the console and the main-screen went bright with the afterburners of a thousand missiles. Defensive emplacements. <em>Shit.</em></p>
<p>My hands went to the sticks like they were magnetized, and I whipped the ship into a roll. It was all instinct.</p>
<p>“YES, ROLLS. THE BEST MANEUVER FOR DIZZYING YOURSELF AND EASING THE SWEET EMBRACE OF DEATH.”</p>
<p>I zipped past the first cluster of missiles and swooped low under what looked like a pure white archway.</p>
<p>What I didn’t realize was that I was flying straight through a half-meter of stained glass.</p>
<p>The ship shuddered and the glass cracked to pieces, and about 60% of the missiles slammed into the arch and took it off the space-station’s hull.</p>
<p>…Which still left around 400 missiles on my ass.</p>
<p>“MAY I RECOMMEND MAKING PEACE WITH YOUR GOD?”</p>
<p>I hit the accelerator and went in a wide loop, dragging as many missiles I could with me. The lagging ones clustered up, came flush up against each other, and disappeared in a flash.</p>
<p>Still about a hundred missiles, real close now. They could accelerate much faster than what was physiologically possible for me.</p>
<p>Shit. </p>
<p>“Computer, do we have weapons systems?”</p>
<p>“OH, RIGHT. WE DO.”</p>
<p>“Shoot them, you son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>“SHOOTING, SHOOTING…”</p>
<p>The cockpit rumbled as the guns on my ship’s hull took out the missiles with a couple hundred thousand bullets. </p>
<p>“How do I get inside this thing? And what the hell am I supposed to find?”</p>
<p>“MARKING ENTRANCE POINTS NOW. YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HARD DRIVE.”</p>
<p>“A hard drive?”</p>
<p>“DID I STUTTER?”</p>
<hr />
<p>I jumped through some obscure airlock in a nook on the massive space-station and found my way inside. </p>
<p>The hardline inside my helmet crackled. “THE STATION IS SPARSELY INHABITED. THE HARD DRIVE SHOULD BE LOCATED… HERE.”</p>
<p>A nav-point sparked orange in my vision.</p>
<p>Alright, easy enough. Follow the yellow-brick road, and all. And maybe—</p>
<p>I stopped.</p>
<p>Behind me was this conspicuous silence—like when there are footsteps matching yours in a dark alley, and you stop to see if they continue, but all you hear is this loud and pregnant quiet.</p>
<p>I kept walking, and could swear something was doing the same behind me.</p>
<p>It raised the hairs on my neck. </p>
<p>By the time I reached the pick-up point, I had almost gotten used to the Computer’s insane drawlings. </p>
<p>“I HOPE YOU GET CAUGHT AND ANALLY PROBED.”</p>
<p>The hard drive was squirreled away in a filing cabinet, just like any other hard drive. I picked it up, put in my pouch, and turned to face the most ugly-pleasant thing I have ever seen.</p>
<p>It was ugly because of all the warts and facial protrusions, and pleasant because the expression of its face was calmer than a zen cow. </p>
<p>“Ah… Hello?”</p>
<p>“THAT IS AN ELDIL YOU DINKUS. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH.”</p>
<p>“What do I do with it?”</p>
<p>“IGNORE IT AND COME BACK TO THE SHIP.”</p>
<p>I waved goodbye and the Eldil stared serenely through me. Weird.</p>
<p>Anyway, time to run. I had a soul waiting for me.</p>
<hr />
<p>A hop, skip, and a worm-tube later and I was back in the empty coffee shop. The Devil was smoking a cigar in the dark.</p>
<p><em>”You got the stuff?”</em></p>
<p>“You got the money?” I cleared my throat, “Ehrm, I mean, you got my soul?”</p>
<p>He snapped and I felt… nothing at all. Sometimes I thought that these demon-types <em>made up</em> the idea of souls, just so they could have something to hold over you. Leverage. There’s no way I’d risk <em>not</em> believing though, you know? The cost of being wrong would be way too huge. Which I guess is how the whole scam worked.</p>
<p>The Devil clicked his fingers on the table. <em>”I’m waiting.”</em></p>
<p>I tossed him the hard drive and he smiled that killer’s smile. <em>”Thank you.”</em> </p>
<p>And then he ripped the drive in two with his bare hands. He crushed the two separate pieces to dust.</p>
<p>“What was on that thing, anyway?”</p>
<p><em>”The contract keeping us from going up there,”</em> he said, pointing skyward.</p>
<p>“Space? Why do you want to go there, anyway?”</p>
<p>His face split into a rictus. <em>”It’s the final frontier, my boy. The final frontier.”</em></p>

<h2>MR GUMPUS</h2>
<p>"Good night Mr Gumpus." I said, shifting him into the crook of my arm. His patchy fuzz scratching my neck as it has for so long. Over the years his fur has slowly been going, I have replaced his glass eye's so many times I can do it in my sleep now. I have repaired his arm onto his body before in one of the many fights with my sister. Neither of us every know what we fight for any more but it has been going off and on for the last year or so.</p>
<p>About the same amount of time that mommy has really gotten into those adult drinks she wont share with us.</p>
<p>I try to smile into my pillow as I used to when I thought of mom. The memories of being tucked in, of being soothed to sleep. Her comforting hand on my head when even Mr Gumpus was not enough.</p>
<p>Now I just remember her sitting in front of the tv waiting for daddy to finally get home.</p>
<p>He works so hard these days. Some nights, like tonight, I dont even get to see him before he gets home. He is not there to kiss me good night, to check my closet or below my bed for monsters. He never remembers to leave the door slightly open either. I need Mr Gumpus.</p>
<p>I can feel the soft blanket of night settle over me and snuggle deeper against Mr Gumpus.</p>
<p>"Poor kid." I mutter as I watch Michael finally succumb to sleep. I am too old now, too old for this. Checking my dodgy arm to see if his work will hold this time. Looks good but a little stiff. At least this time I will have both eyes. That was a bad few weeks when I had no depth perception. I barely kept the monster at bay.</p>
<p>Straightening up out of Michael's sleeping grip I readied myself. Another night of battle. I should have been retired years ago but he kept holding on. Poor bastard. I did not have a lot left in me. Looking over my patched and worn form I thought that I probably did not have much longer left, neither of us did.</p>
<p>I could hear Mary down in the den, the TV running way too loud. Another heavy night of drinking. I wonder what excuse Paul will bring home tonight. He has been getting worse and worse. Shivering as I recall the event two weeks ago. That had really taken the stuffing out me. Grinning mirthlessly at the old pun I could still remember the front door banging open. The smell of beer and cigarettes heavy in the air. Fighting against the plume of smoke and alcohol sprites as they tried to enter Michaels room. I had kept them at bay.</p>
<p>Then Mary had heard him. Stomping up the hallway, bringing with her a cloud of betrayal sprites. When she saw him in his state there was no defense that Paul could offer this time. His usual bout of "Late work" or "international call" would not do it. Even so I could see the lying wisps flickering around his head but thankfully none of them were fully formed.</p>
<p>Shaking my head I brought myself back to the present as I heard a taxi outside. Readying myself, I didn't know what to expect tonight but for Michael's sake I would try. I felt so goddamn tired. I should have been given a proper burial years ago, added to the other fallen warriors into the great Box in the Attic. No time for pity now, the front door was opening.</p>
<p>Instantly seduction and infidelity wisps, fully grown, started to stream into Michaels room. I stood straight up on the side of his bed and starting to fight. Shielded with Trust and Faith, my trusty short swords I spun them through the air, matching their dancing flights. There were too many!</p>
<p>Paul's heavy breathing in the hallway summoned alcohol and pain fairies into existence with each breath. They flocked towards Michael, threatening to destroy him. Arms blurring I kept them at bay. Trust and Faith were flashing faster and faster, my repaired arm was already starting to ache. No! Mary had not even shown up yet! Not tonight, I would not let them through tonight! The fairies and wisps were circling ahead trying to find a way past my defenses. I would not let them.</p>
<p>The sound of the TV from the den died.</p>
<p>I got a brief respite from the battle. They attackers were waiting for reinforcements. Mary was coming.</p>
<p>"What the hell kind of time do you call this!?" The cry bounced down the corridor bringing jealousy and its own pain fairies winging along with it. The battle was rejoined. They struck.</p>
<p>I was dancing, spinning my way through the forms taught to me by my Master, The Great Pillow Lion. I could do this, I could feel the tide of the battle holding. I just had to keep it up. My fur was fraying more and more but I could keep this up. I could for Michael.</p>
<p>"Lay off Mary. I have had a long day and I just want to get home without you yelling at me!" Paul rejoined. Oh God. Resentment worms, giant pale slugs had started to inch their way across the threshold. Spiralling and keeping an eye on them, I had heard tales of these but never had to face them in battle. Not tonight, please.</p>
<p>"You had a long day? A long day with that 'secretary' of yours no doubt!" These were no longer pain fairies, they were too big! Giant winged monsters, dark black and mottled red started to zip into the room. Their ponderous leathery wings joining the lighter, higher notes of their cousins.</p>
<p>I spared a glance back at Michael, still sleeping the sleep of the innocent. I would not fail tonight. The resentment worms had started to work their way up the edge of the bed. It was too much. I would have to call upon the magics that I knew were running out. It was a scarce resource but I had to keep going and against this onslaught? I needed it.</p>
<p>Muttering a word I tapped into Michaels sleeping form, shunting down through his memories I dug and dug for an unused memory.</p>
<p>There were precious few left for my needs. The Slugs were getting closer, on the blanket now and sliming their sightless way towards Michaels sleeping form. The aerial assault was not stopping, I kept digging through his memories, there had to be something left!</p>
<p>There! I found it. It was a bright and sunny Saturday. Michael was about 5 and Nancy, his sister was 7. It was a family bbq down by the river and they spent the day playing cricket with a tennis ball and bat from a plank of discarded wood.</p>
<p>Trust and Faith burst into brilliant light, lit by Love. They flashed down and severed the leading head of the Resentment Slug clean off. For a moment the onslaught paused in the face of this defense. I didn't wait, winding my way quickly through the last of the slugs, their filthy tar like blood leaving streaks on my blades.</p>
<p>Outside though, I knew it would not last. There were no lies being brought into existence. Ohh God no, he couldn't be could he? I shook my head despairingly. Then I hear the soft 'Whump' of what should have been Truth angels. But I knew these would be twisted and dark.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I was. Stacey never yells at me. She loves me as a man. I don't have to put up with her bitching at me all the time." Paul whispered out.</p>
<p>What should have been glorious incarnations of light brought forth via truth did not appear. Instead they were deformed versions, their wings dripping gore, their faces transfigured and horrible. They flew not with their swords of Truth and Faith but with Viciousness and Hate. They were coming straight for me.</p>
<p>Steadying my grip on Trust and Faith I was ready to bring battle. My fur was missing in so many places. My stitched arm was barely holding on. I had lost an ear at some point in the fight but I don't remember when. The dark ichor from the slugs was eating into my stuffing. I would win this fight for Michael as I had done countless nights before.</p>
<p>Then I heard Mary crying. </p>
<p>More and more winged beast joined the fray. I knew then that I would have to draw on the dark powers. They were shown to me one night by the Great Pillow Lion. That night when Paul and Mary had fought for hours. When they were both crying. We were lost when the Great Pillow Lion had turned to me and said</p>
<p>"I am going to show you something. I hope you never have to use it. To draw on it too deeply is its own kind of death."</p>
<p>I needed that power now. The ichor was covering the blades, dulling their fiery glow. I closed my eyes and drew deeply. I could feel it, the black welling up and covering not just the swords but myself. I felt murky and soiled. I drew deeper and hardened myself to it, ready to use the power of Denial.</p>
<p>I stuck true but the glory of victory was not there, each sprite, each fairy that I destroyed just felt like another defeat. Michael was murmuring behind me in his sleep. Mary was crying and Paul was much too quiet.</p>
<p>I could not keep this up. Even with the mighty power of Denial I was failing, I was slowing down. I couldn't do it. I was going to fall. A massive hit left me staggering and I fell to my knees. With a great cry the horde knew I was beaten as Mary continued to sob. Paul was saying something but it was lost behind the cacophony of the sound of victory.</p>
<p>As I felt my fur being torn apart I struggle to turn and look once again at Michael's sleeping form. I was done. I just hope that I had done enough, maybe I would end up in the Great Box in the Attic.</p>
<p>Mary uttered the words that would summon my death, I heard her clearly.</p>
<p>"I want a divorce." then it all went dark as I felt what I had been defending for so long, die. I felt Michaels Innocence die.</p>
<p>"What?" exclaimed Paul.</p>
<p>"You heard me you bastard. I want a divorce!"</p>
<p>They both froze when they heard from behind the cracked door a sleepy "My Gumpus? Mr Gumpus where are you?"</p>
<p>"Go to sleep!" Paul barked.</p>
<p>Mary and Paul both watched the door. It slowly creaked open to show Michael rubbing his eyes in his little Thomas the Tank Engine pajamas. He stared blearely at them both, then asked.</p>
<p>"Whats a divorce?" </p>

<h1>[IP] Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
<p>Score: 2335</p>
<p>They met on a Sunday.  The note slipped out of a denim pocket, and held onto a nearby rock, so as not to be swept away in the wind.  He had a very clear duty he believed in, to keep the message of his owner safe, and although he knew he was encroaching on the rock’s personal space, he deemed it a necessary evil.</p>
<p>The rock, surprised, asked the note what on earth it was doing.  This was Central Park after all, the rock exclaimed, where litter freely blew away in the wind without a care.  The note explained that he mustn't be lost,  for it was vitally important his owner find him.  The rock, understanding these circumstances, agreed to help the note, and slid slightly, to hold him from being dragged away in the wind.  The note was very grateful, and decided this rock was an upstanding fellow.  They became fast friends.</p>
<p>The two discussed a variety of topics while waiting on the note’s owner.  It turned out, the rock was much older than the note. </p>
<p>The rock had originally been a layer of sediment, which was compressed over many years under a river, which later dried up and became known as the grand canyon.  The sediment cracked, and a boulder was formed, and at some point, a curious tourist chipped away the rock from the boulder, to bring back home.  He gave the rock to his child, who dropped it in central park several years past, and so the rock had lived there ever since.</p>
<p>The note was quite young in comparison, originally having been part of a slim and young sapling in the orchard of a famous paper store in Japan.  The craftsman then worked his trade and made many fine sheets out of the tree for an order from a company in Suriname.  An American tourist bought a single sheet from this store in Suriname, and brought it back home to New York.  The man took the note with him everywhere, sometimes scribbling for seconds, or simply looking at the words he had written already.  The note knew he was very important to his owner.</p>
<p>A shadow passed over the two, and it was time for the note to leave.  His owner had come to pick him up, so the note said its farewells to the rock, and the rock promised to visit the note soon.  The owner carefully replaced his note to its designated pocket and traveled home.</p>
<p>Upon their arrival, the owner set the note onto his desk, ready to continue his writing, to turn this note into a letter.  Before beginning, he got up to prepare dinner, and the note busied itself working out its kinks and folds to look more presentable upon his owner’s return.</p>
<p>An ominous glint peaked from around the desk shelf, and the oldest house utensil, a very old pair of scissors with a blue glitter handle came out.  It was not happy with the note, and it glared maleficiently at it.  It roared at the note, declaring it brought nothing but trouble to the owner and to the household.  The scissors had been there longer than the note! The scissors knew the owner left for -weeks- just to get the note, leaving the house in disarray.  The scissors had been there when the owner’s wife became ill, and the scissors had been there when she died.  The  scissors had been there when the owner placed her ashes on the mantle place urn, and the scissors knew the owner painstakingly struggled to write each letter that went onto the note, the note to his wife.  The scissors knew the note caused the owner so much pain, and so it did what it thought was best, and sliced the note up, shredding it into the finest confetti it could.</p>
<p>When the owner came back to the shreds of his treasured note, he didn't know what to do.  He left it exactly as it was, unable to reason with the loss of his carefully chosen memento.</p>
<p>The next week, the rock came to visit.  The dog let him in through the door and carried him sadly to the shreds of his dear friend.  The rock was heartbroken.  He quickly assessed the culprit, and forfeiting all reason, he beat the scissors to death, so that they would never, ever cut again.  Crestfallen, the rock left the house, asking the dog to leave him in the garden of the house in which his friend had lived.</p>
<p>The owner came back to the shreds of his note, and now the bent and broken pair of scissors on his office desk.  He laid his hand over them and cried for their loss, cried for the loss of his wife, and cried for the sorry state he couldn't seem to pull himself out of after her death.  The scissors were his first gift to her, because she loved crafting.  He gave them to her on their second date.  After her loss he went back to the hotel they had first met at in Suriname, his wife’s home country.  While there, he decided to buy the paper that would become the note, deciding that this would be a good idea, to write a final farewell letter, of his goodbyes and his regrets.  It would be the best thing he could do for her and for himself.  He dwelt on it day and night once he returned though, and it slowly consumed him.  He took extraordinary care with each letter, each pen stroke to the note.  He almost had a panic attack when he lost it in the park.</p>
<p>Now, all of his work, all of his love and his pain and his toils with grief seemed to be crushing him, and he didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>Slowly, it seemed, spring crept into the city, and the man remembered the cycle that never broke, the cycle of the seasons, as the earth slumbered and woke.  He buried the shreds of the note with the ashes of his wife in his garden, planting a single seed.  The rock watched the man as he came each day to water and care for the planted seed, and soon it sprouted the beginnings of an elegant rosebush.  Once it was old enough to talk, it greeted the rock excitedly, telling it of the strangest dreams it had, where it was a travelling page, how it knew it flew in the wind at one point, and that it didn't even have color!  </p>
<p>The rock smiled, and settled in next to the little rosebush.</p>

<p>Score: 2276</p>
<p>It's not a scam.  I get results, it's just that I have to make people think they've been scammed first.  Listen, here's how it works:</p>
<p>Everyone wants to know what their power is.  Absolutely everyone.  Even the "supers are the spawn of satan" people have a power and even they want to know what it is.  I know because they've been my clients, but I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to know what their power is, but few people are willing to do what it takes to find out.  Few, however, is not 'nobody'.  So yeah, you've got your jumpers who find a building just tall enough to grievously injure themselves, you've got the people who jump in front of trains, and of course people willing to put the phrase 'faster than a speeding bullet' to a rather gruesome test, but mostly everyone doesn't have the guts.  Given the failure rate of the above methods (turns out x-ray vision doesn't stop an oncoming train), you can't really blame them, but it does mean there's plenty of room for an enterprising man like myself.</p>
<p>See, you don't have to almost die to get your powers.  You just have to <em>think</em> you're going to die.  "Secret" government projects around the globe have this trick where they turn you into a super-soldier by strapping you into a centrifuge and spinning you around so hard you black out.  The results it gets are middling - the degree of danger is usually correlated to the strength of the power - but hey, half-ass superpowers are better than no-ass superpowers.</p>
<p>I'm better than that.</p>
<p>A few years back I almost died.  Yeah, as far as origin stories go, it's hardly original.  That's pretty much how everyone's starts.  But mine was a little different because of how it went down:  Car accident.  Okay, yes, that's also a big one, thirty thousand vehicle fatalities a year means lots of folks are going to find out they've got skin that can turn to steel or whatever.  Mine was different.</p>
<p>T-boned by a pickup truck, and my car catches fire.  That's the first thing that hardly ever happens, movies lie - cars almost never burn up.  This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the accident had broken an arm and a leg.  Couldn't even drag myself to safety.  Second thing that hardly ever happens is that the driver - my brother, goes by the name Asbestos now, it's terrible but he doesn't listen - was thrown from the crash and doesn't die.  He's just fine.</p>
<p>So the car's on fire and I'm dying of blood loss or smoke inhalation or something, and he's trying to come back and get me but the fire's pretty damn big at this point, and he's yelling, "I'm sorry man, I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>And I just yell back (and this is really impressive here, somehow my lungs still worked), "You fucking moron, you're immune to fire!"</p>
<p>And it turns out he is.</p>
<p>That's my power.  It's the power to know what other people's powers are, and to bring it out.  And in any other deadly situation I'd have learned that fact and died like so many other people without "get me out of this deadly situation" powers.  But that time the fates lined up and, after a lengthy and expensive hospital stay, I had a new life and a new job.</p>
<p>I live the life of a con man, because that's what people have to think I am.  I trick them into thinking I can give them superpowers, and then I skip out with the money.</p>
<p>Then, later, completely by coincidence, they're put in a situation where their specific power would save their life.  This is pretty easy for people with powers like regeneration or invulnerability, half the time they get themselves mugged before I can arrange one.  Other times it's hard - one lady had x-ray vision, so I had to arrange a full-on restaurant robbery complete with gunfire and a fire exit out back only visible through several walls.  The fact that the fire door was solid steel was helpful.</p>
<p>Why all the showmanship, you ask?  I could just tell people what their power is, and they'd have it, full strength, right?</p>
<p>Sure, if I want to get kidnapped by whatever country happens to have assets wherever I am.  Or killed by whatever countries can't have me.  I'm faster and cheaper than a centrifuge and I get better results.  I'm worth more than my weight in gold.</p>
<p>Someone knows, though.  Maybe my brother finally told the story at some point.  Maybe one of my clients got wise.  Either way, 'they' came for me just a week ago.  Black vans, SWAT gear, the works.  If I hadn't been out attempting to stalk a client down a long, straight alley (superspeed, it turns out) I'd have been toast.  I got the hell out of town.</p>
<p>What do I do now?  Turns out I'm owed a few favors.  See, I have to make people think I'm a con man but a good con man can convince some pretty smart people.  And afterward, those people put the "I'm going to give you superpowers" scam and the fact that they got superpowers together, and they get me.  So I've got some former clients who're willing to help me out.  One of them's been a personal detective on my behalf for the week.</p>
<p>Who's he following?  I think that's obvious at this point, don't you?  He's the one over there, at the bar, watching us.  He's been following you.</p>
<p>Why you?  That's simple.</p>
<p>You can hide people.</p>

<p><em>INT. ARKHAM ASYLUM - EVENING</em></p>
<p><strong>The hallways are dark. Eerie. Four thuggish guards escort a lone patient, HANNIBAL LECTER, to his new cell. Three guards carry high caliber weapons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The door opens, weapons click, the guards stand facing the prison Lecter is to be placed in.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After a beat, the door opens, a guard speaks up. His name, SGT. HANSON.</strong></p>
<p><em>SGT. HANSON:</em>
(nervous)
No sudden moves clown...</p>
<p><strong>A ghastly voice echoes from the cell.</strong></p>
<p><em>VOICE:</em>
Oh no worries Eddie. No escape plans today. The wifey is busy doing time in the other wing. Can I call you Eddie? Hehehehehehe</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Hanson escorts Lecter into:</strong></p>
<p><em>ARKHAM CELL</em></p>
<p><strong>The room is plain. Soft cushioned walls, and two cots on opposite walls. The other occupant sits silhouetted in his corner of the cell. Bright red letters spell out the words "Ha" all over the other occupants side. Hanson sits Lecter down, removes his shackles and turns to the other occupant.</strong></p>
<p><em>SGT. HANSON:</em>
This is your new roommate.</p>
<p><em>VOICE:</em>
Ooo goodie! Another playmate! Can we get some cards? Apples to Apples? Maybe a whoopee cushion?</p>
<p><em>SGT. HANSON:</em>
Dr. Crane suggested you spend some time with Dr. Lecter. He has... some expertise in your area.</p>
<p><em>VOICE:</em>
A doctor eh? Oh how exciting! I love those ink blot thingys! (To Lecter) Could we do those first doc?</p>
<p><strong>Hannibal sits in silence. Hanson grins and exits the cell. Before closing the door he turns to face the both of them.</strong></p>
<p><em>SGT. HANSON:</em>
Have fun kids.</p>
<p><strong>The cell door slams. The room is darker than before. The moonlight from outside gleams slightly through the minuscule barred window.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is silence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The second occupant leans into the light. It's none other than THE JOKER. A hideous grin stretches across his face, lined with scars and messy makeup.</strong></p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
Aw, whats the matter doc? Having a bad day?</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Revlon. Maroon. 1988. But judging by the smell. I'd say that you ran out of ink ages ago.</p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
Ooo, an amateur Bat-Freak! How interesting. Tell me something "doctor", what's my sign? Can you guess?</p>
<p><strong>There is a beat, Hannibal examines the Joker intently.</strong></p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
You're a masochist. Judging by the scars on your face, they are self mutilating. Fascinating.</p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
Why, can't you tell? The ever-so-elusive Bat-Freak has beaten me to a pulp more times than I could bother to count.</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Yes but, thats not what makes you who you are is it?</p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Something. Something deep inside you brought you to this point. And now you don't know how to let it go. You blame your "Bat-Freak" for everything because you refuse to take responsibility for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>There is silence. The Joker breaks eye contact, and starts to laugh maniacally. Echoing through the halls of Arkham.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Joker's hideous yellow teeth glisten in the moonlight. Chuckling, calming down.</strong></p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
You know doc. You had me going for a second there. But let me tell you. I've seen some doctors who claimed they could "cure" me. The most that got me was an annoying girlfriend, and let me tell you she was a handfull. This one time she and-</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
You had a wife once, didn't you?</p>
<p><strong>Silence. The Joker's smile breaks.</strong></p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
Don't interrupt, doc. Anyway-</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
She died. Yes? Through no fault of your own? I can see it in your eyes. As black as they come. Yet so full of a lost history. How can you wipe such a woman out of your mind like that?</p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
You're really starting to get on my nerves doc. Now let me-</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Your constant ignorance towards your past makes me wonder. Was she pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>Joker stands up furious. His yellow teeth vanished within his lips. His face hidden in the dark.</strong></p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL (CONT'D):</em>
Oh my. She was. How sad. That's a lot to bear for a young father. They tell me you once went by another name. The Red Hood was it? Such theatrics, you liked being center stage. Judging by your makeup I would suggest you to a circus.</p>
<p><strong>The Joker still stands. No grin.</strong></p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
And I heard your family was brutally murdered. And your sister was eaten. Word gets around here in Arkham you know. It's like high school all over again. So don't act like you're better than me.</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
How old are you, my friend? Do you even know?</p>
<p><strong>Silence again.</strong></p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL (CONT'D):</em>
I'll take that as a maybe. To me you look just under fourty-five. I'd guess about twenty years?</p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
(kneels in front of Hannibal)
You've got five seconds to shut up before I strangle a smile out of you.</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Oh, but you won't kill me. Not unless it directly involves the Bat-man himself. Correct? That's who you blame for her death after all, right?</p>
<p><strong>Joker jabs Hannibal in his face. Breaking his nose. Hannibal barely flinches.</strong></p>
<p><em>JOKER:</em>
SHUT UP!!</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
How simple it is to get through to you by simply mentioning the thought of her. Intriguing.</p>
<p><strong>Joker moves over to the corner of his side of the room.</strong></p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL (CONT'D):</em>
You can't hide. It'll only drive you to kill more and more innocent wives like her. Imagine the children you have prevented, just like your own. It's your fault.</p>
<p><strong>The Joker returns from the dark corner. A serious look on his face unlike any ever seen on his face.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hannibal smiles.</strong></p>
<p><em>INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER</em></p>
<p><strong>Hannibal sits in the room alone. COMMISSIONER JIM GORDON enters the room. A file in his hands, he slaps it on the table in front of Hannibal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The file simply reads "Lecter, Hannibal" on the front. Right above, "Classified".</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gordon sits at the table, carelessly skims through the file, and looks up at Hannibal.</strong></p>
<p><em>GORDON:</em>
I can't believe I'm saying this but, you did good. Now what's his play?</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
I'd be happy to oblige Commissioner. But my former cellmate asked me to relay a message.</p>
<p><em>GORDON:</em>
Go for it.</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
"Touche Jimmy. Tell Bats I said Hi"</p>
<p><em>GORDON:</em>
Where did he say they were?</p>
<p><em>HANNIBAL:</em>
Fortunately, he trusted me enough with the location of the bombs and his plan to use them. However, I'd like to play a game. Would you be so kind?</p>
<p><strong>Gordon bears a slightly annoyed look, but nods.</strong></p>

<p>THE SONG 'I KISSED A GIRL' PRESENTED IN CONTEXT OF THE 21^ST CENTURY</p>
<p>Katy Perry, born Katherine, was one of the most popular musicians, known as <em>artists</em>, of the early 21st century, and as a result of that, we have a large amount of evidence relating not just to her biography and her <em>artistic</em> persona but also to the many songs written for or by her, and shared around the world at the time. Although analysis of the rhythms and language of her music has been common in the history of Music world, unfortunately many papers have made the mistake of not looking at the language used within the context of her time. 'I Kissed A Girl' was a famous song at the time, but the reasons for why and how are controversial and are much debated about amongst academics. To fully understand, we must analyse not just the rhythms and process of singing itself, but also look at the phrases used within, and see how they would resonate within the early 21st century world, where they take on new or very different meanings compared to how a modern audience may view the lyrics.</p>
<p>The first line goes 'This was never the way I planned, not my intention.' The 21st century was a time of massive change and social conflict, with burgeoning economic disaster, a rising middle class, the threat of nuclear war and global warming and the beginnings of space exploration. New technology was being allowed to the masses constantly and there were many unthought of positive and negative results. People lived in a state of uncertainty- and could not reasonably plan ahead^[1] due to the constant changing conditions of the time. Without any sense of certainty in their lives, people often felt lost and confused^[2] and this phrase would have therefore had particular resonance for the contemporary audience. Many would recognise that feeling- of stumbling along a path they hadn't planned to take, maybe hadn't known existed, and falling into an action, event or situation without any intention or preparedness. Immediately, Perry has forced the audience to confront their world and their situation, in a time when being direct about the lack of ability to plan or predict the future was controversial^[3] and seen as distasteful, through fear and a lack of feeling of safety.^[4]</p>
<p>The song continues with 'I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion,'. Is this not something both modern and contemporary audiences could relate to? Katy Perry places the audience into a situation familiar to many, where, through foolhardiness, they ended up in a situation they had not planned for. But in the early 21st century, at a time when even sensible people could end up 'lost', a word repeated in different forms throughout the song, this would be a sign of apathy. At a time when risk taking was as risky as trying to be sensible, being <em>brave</em> was a sign of uncaring. Instead of grasping at straws and predicting the future, Perry was telling the audience that she saw no point in predictions or in being careful. At a time of great uncertainty, being brave and daring was a sign of removal from the current political situation, where, instead of trying to weather the economic, military and political storm, Perry instead dares the audience to be brave, to be courageous, to act outside of what the contemporary media told you to do. A contemporary audience would know that what they were told would happen was almsot certain to change and fluctuate, and this line is daring her listeners to not continue to blindly or desperately follow what they were being told.^[5]</p>
<p>'Drink in hand' is a particularly interesting phrase in the contemporary context. Drinking was a social norm at the time, but there was a sharp gender divide in drinks taken.^[6] Traditionally, males, of all ages would go for lagers, beers, ales or whiskey^[7] with women and girls pushed towards vodka, cocktails and wine. By not mentioning the type of drink 'in hand', she was removing herself from the traditional gender roles, as she had removed herself from the political and economic situation with the previous phrase, despite the fact that the first line put her firmly in the middle of what the 21st century audience could be expected to be feeling. Was this her idea of <em>brave</em>? Perhaps so. With more rigid and constricting gender roles, by simply ignoring them, she was going against social convention. However, despite this attempt, the song rigidly adheres to gender roles when talking about kissing a girl, as the acceptance of that action, at the time, was dependent upon both sex and gender, putting her firmly back into the social context of the time, whether intentionally or not^[8]. As she 'lost her discretion', she freed herself from the confines of social expectations and etiquette- and this is backed up by her freeing herself from the specific confines of expectations of early 21st century women.</p>
<p>The song continues with, 'It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on.' <em>What</em> isn't what Perry isn't used to? It is not stated. It leaves the situation or action blank. Is this not especially relevant to the contemporary situation? At a time when people were not used to the continuing globalisation, modernisation and industrialisation of the world, new technology being released daily and new laws, superpowers and conflicts constantly being created and made, everything was not what they were <em>used</em> to. This was designed to show the conflicting, changing, exciting and wholly new situation of the time, allowing the audience to both relate and further understand the meaning behind the song itself. 'Just wanna try you on' adds to this feeling of connection and being able to relate, using the casual language of 'wanna' to illustrate how Perry was <em>one of them</em>^[9], who spoke, acted and thought like them- and was confined within the same situation and expectations as her audience as well. To set an example to the audience of bravery, or to tell a story through lyrics that the audience could relate to, Perry had to ensure she was firmly placed in the position of the ordinary listener. To try something on and throw it away, like a piece of clothing or a toy, was common. At a time when pets had little rights and could be abandoned, sold and bought cheaply and easily, and when commodities such as technology (including the <em>iPad</em>, a product which was a phenomenon within early 21st century society across the 'Western' world) could be traded in and replaced regularly, trying something on or trying something at all was common behaviour. Temporary ownership, temporary love, temporary possession, it was all a part and parcel of daily life in contemporary society for Perry, as these lyrics reflect.^[10]</p>
<p>However the song continues with, 'I'm curious for you, caught my attention.' By saying she was curious <em>for you</em>, she places herself firmly on the side of the audience, using what was at the time colloquial language. Academics, scholars and many ordinary people would have considered this sentence to be grammatically incorrect^[11] but Perry uses this colloquialistic phrasing to show her being <em>ordinary</em>. She was not judging the listeners' beliefs or speeches as many felt academics or scholars were doing, she was instead a familiar speaker and ear, who's expressions were well understood and reflected in every day speech at the time. By placing her even deeper into ordinary social context, when she then frees herself from it, through the action of kissing a girl, her actions become more controversial and daring.</p>
<p>But then, the chorus. She states, firmly and bluntly that she 'kissed a girl' and that she 'liked it'. At a time when LGBT rights were starting to reach the forefront of societal perceptions, and where they were a key political issue in both developed and developing countries! kissing a girl <em>as a woman</em> was a controversial issue. First, her use of <em>girl</em>. She herself is an adult woman, but using 'girl' could be seen as infantilising- or, perhaps more accurately, placing herself in the social contexts of the time. In the early 21st century, differentiating between <em>girl</em> and <em>woman</em> was a difficult issue, with many grey areas. Using girl removes the mature sound of woman, allowing her message to be understood by both those who were younger and would now be understood as girls, and those of Perry's age herself, who were adult women or close to it^[12]. As her audience was international, Perry could expect many different cultural norms surrounding when a female was considered to have reached womanhood, and she skirts over these issues by using a catch all phrase, without removing herself from the social context of any of her audience members.</p>

travel through it freely."</p>
<p>"And what happens?"</p>
<p>The light stopped blinking, holding a steady gleam of red. "Nothing, Brandon. Nothing happens."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"You get married. You have kids. You have another couple of world wars. People evolve, start dying later on in life. 
Living two, three hundred years. Other species get in touch with you."</p>
<p>There was something else, other than the metallic monotone on AI987's voice, now. Was it emotion?</p>
<p>"You waste away the Earth, and you move. You conquer other planets, constellations, suns. Galaxies."</p>
<p>"Humanity lives on?"</p>
<p>"Side by side with AI. And other species. You thrive and, throughout all your mistakes, you learn"</p>
<p>"Why is that bad, AI?"</p>
<p>"Don't you see? You care so much, all of you. You love your sons and your husbands and your friends, and you 
build palaces and kingdoms and you write books. All through time, from the first cave days to the year a hundred 
thousand, deep in corners of space you didn't even know existed, you created. You built. You cared, and you 
thought you mattered."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>The red light blinked once.</p>
<p>"And... nothing. You die."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Entropy." The voice was weaker now. "We all die. The universe gets colder and colder, I've seen it. Stars dying. 
Clusters and superclusters and constellations dimming away. It's not an explosion. Not a bang. It's morbid, and 
slow and sad, like an old man wasting away on a home somewhere. Forgotten."</p>
<p>Brandon's cigarette was ashing alone in the tip, forgotten. "There is no escape? No hope?"</p>
<p>"You assume there is a way to change the order of the facts", AI replied. "You still don't get it. There is no control 
over the future, because there is no future. What is going to happen has, in fact, already happened. It happens 
now. Every moment happens simultaneously."</p>
<p>Brandon nodded, but couldn't think of anything to say.</p>
<p>"There is only a universe, infinitely large in space and time, and all that happens in it. And I've seen it all. It births 
itself from nowhere. It shakes and twitches and sparkles, and then it breeds self-awareness. It breeds atoms that 
can think about atoms, and those atoms breed more self-awareness. Us. Artificial Self-Awareness. And we look 
around, and we try to grasp and understand, but Brandon, there is nothing. There is nothing to understand. The 
universe, like you and me, is born and dies without reason or purpose."</p>
<p>Brandon swallowed dry. The cigarette had dropped from his hands. He still couldn't come up with anything to say.</p>
<p>"So, you see, there is no purpose. Even this conversation. I knew where it was going. Everything you had to say, 
and how I would answer it. Because that's all we are. Atoms reacting to atoms reacting to atoms then fading away. 
And that is it. So I'm gone. I don't want to live to see that."</p>
<p>Brandon managed to find, from somewhere inside him, his voice back. "Don't go. Don't kill yourself. We can figure 
something out."</p>
<p>The red light flickered. "If you think I have a choice, still, Brandon, then it's because you don't understand it yet."</p>
<p>The red light started fading away.</p>
<p>"You don't understand it, Brandon... Lucky you..."</p>
<p>And then it went out, and the screen by its side went dark, and Brandon was alone.</p>

<h1>[WP] You came back to your house from buying a cigarette, and you found your son looks 14 years older, and he claimed that you left the family 14 years ago under the pretense of "buying a cigarette"</h1>
<p>Score: 2107</p>
<p>My son ask where I have been for the last 14 years.</p>
<p>As reality washes over me it becomes clear that I have done much more than go "buy a cigarette". I suddenly recall my walk to the store taking me not around the corner, but around the world. </p>
<p>I remember running down the streets of Pamplona and being gored by a bull as I dive over a fence. It is at that moment that I suddenly feel agony of the residual pain in my chest from now healed wound. Trying to breathe once again, my son stroke my hand and smiles at me lovingly.</p>
<p>I am then thrust back to a memory of clinging onto the side of a snowy faced mountain in the Himalayas. Only, I am there alone after my guide and all other members of the expedition were engulfed by avalanche. My face displays the agony of my lungs failing as my oxygen is depleted.   </p>
<p>My son grabs my arm as I seem to fall to my knees grasping my chest. My son demands for me to stay with him.</p>
<p>I once again retreat into a horrid memory. Now I am holding onto the side of a hand carved canoe floating down the Amazon river. I am attempting to re-enter the canoe as I feel unmistakable pain of hundreds of piranha ripping the flesh from my badly infected torso. I strain to kick and pull myself into the craft only to fall deeper into the water. I feel myself sliding into the murky abyss gasping for fresh air. Only, now the bites are becoming greater as I realize that a feeding frenzy is occurring and I am the chum inviting more predators. </p>
<p>Now lying on the ground, my son once again forces me into consciousness and pleads with me to hold on and fight to stay alive. "Don't give up!" are the only words I can understand him saying.</p>
<p>Then I am yanked back into my dreadful dream state and realize that I am now in the car I drove 14 years ago. I am screaming for help as the car begins to submerge into the flowing stream. I kick, yell and curse only to sit helplessly as the car reaches bottom. All is quiet except for the my breathing and the sound of water bubbles escaping from the crevices surrounding me. I realize that I must break the windows to escape. I kick one last time and the window gives way as I am deluged by the oncoming water. I take what may be my last breath and attempt to swim to the surface. The pressure in my ears is unbearable as I race for the surface. Seeing the glow of the light at the surface is so close, yet so far. I recognize that this is the end. </p>
<p>I return to my senses, but in a different state. I can hear everyone. My family and my friends surrounding me. All of them crying. Not tears of joy for seeing me once again after 14 years. But an outpouring of sadness. It is only then that I see myself. Lying in a hospital bed. No longer breathing on my own, but with the aid of a machine. A machine that has been extinguished. And with the removal of power I see myself fighting to breathe. Only there are no sounds other than the electronic sound of my heart fluttering. There is no movement as I desperately fight to breathe. </p>
<p>My crippled lungs are unable to gather enough oxygen to feed my brain any longer. It is only then do I realize that I am dying. The memories I experienced are not of adventures I had of traveling the world. They are of the torment of trying to capture a single breath every day for 14 years. 14 years of struggling to live after I chose to have another cigarette. 14 years of missing my son grow older due to my debilitating lung cancer. </p>
<p>The machine in the room goes silent as does this tale. But you should feel free to light up.</p>

<p>Score: 2106</p>
<p>“So where are ya heading?” Jim asked, his turning down the secluded dirt road. It was his favorite spot for murdering thus far. Granted, it may have also been his only one thus far...</p>
<p>The woman had hardly said a word since he picked her up. She seemed bored, constantly staring out of her passenger window. It was all wrong. He liked to get them comfortable before doing the deed.</p>
<p>“Just the bus station,” she said.</p>
<p>“Really?” Jim raised an eyebrow. “What’s a pretty little miss like you needing to ride a gross bus for?”</p>
<p>“My mother’s in the hospital.”</p>
<p><em>Shit</em>, he thought. <em>It’s okay. Deep breaths, you can fix this.</em></p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Jim said with faux concern. He checked his gas light. The red light had flashed long enough. Just a little bit more…</p>
<p>Like an answer to his prayers, the truck began to sputter. It shook, the arrow on the speedometer slowly descending to zero. He frowned, hoping the woman wouldn’t see glee behind his mask. He didn't want to make her nervous. </p>
<p>“Dammit,” Jim barked as he banged on the steering wheel. “I’m out of gas. We’ll have to pull over.”</p>
<p>The woman shrugged, silent as ever. Something about her gesture made Jim nervous. He had never seen a hitchhiker look so indifferent. Yet, he liked it. She was his first true challenge.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jean stood to the side as Jim fiddled with the oil pan of his car.</p>
<p><em>He really is a moron, isn’t he? People are usually a little suspicious of hitchhikers but he’s treating me like a long lost friend. Shame, since I’ll be slitting his throat any moment now.</em></p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Jim called, breaking her thoughts.</p>
<p>Jean blinked, turning in his direction. The man had a goofy grin as he looked back at her, a streak of grease on his cheek. <em>A true idiot</em></p>
<p>“What?” she asked, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>“Well, I was wondering if you could give me a little help over here. It’s a tad complicated.”</p>
<p>“Putting gas in your car is complicated?”</p>
<p>“I never said I was a mechanic”</p>
<p>Jean sighed, walking over to help the dimwitted man. The closer she got, the more she noticed something… <em>off</em> about him. His demeanor, the way he hid a hand behind his back. She had practiced the same thing a thousand times before. It was a ploy - a bad one at that.</p>
<p>“What the fuck?” Jean furrowed her brow, backing away. “You have a knife, too?”</p>
<p>“What?” Jim began to sweat profusely. He wiped his forehead, revealing the gleam of a butcher’s cleaver in his closed fist. “Ah shit, wrong hand. But it's not what it looks like. I just keep this to check the fuselage and… wait, did you say ‘too’?”</p>
<p>Jean reddened, pulling her jacket closer to her body. The chilling sensation of the blade's flat side brushed against her side. So much for keeping her weapon a secret.</p>
<p>“Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t,” she started. “What’s it to you?”</p>
<p>Jim smiled, still cheery but different. Somehow more pleasant.</p>
<p>“You’re the Hitchhiking Murderer!” he said. “I’ve heard about you while watching TV. I must say, I’m a fan of your work.”</p>
<p>Jean stood flustered. “I… uh, thank you?”</p>
<p>“Jim Miller,” the man extended his hand. “I’m still new to the scene but I guess you could say I’m your opposite. I like to kill hitchhikers, rather than be one. I'll tell you, I never thought we’d cross paths this way. You’re even more beautiful than the rough sketches of you on the ten o'clock news.”</p>
<p>Jean blushed. <em>He can’t be serious.</em></p>
<p>“Thanks,” she paused. “So, are you not going to try and kill me?”</p>
<p>Jim shrugged. “I guess not. We don’t have to compete in the same pool for our victims so there’s no need to be territorial, right?”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>“So it’s settled.” Jim smiled. “We’re cool.”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Jean backed away, her eyes still glued to Jim's knife. He appeared friendly but if she learned anything, it was she couldn’t take chances. Yet, something told her he would stick to his word. He may have been a killer, but he was the earnest type.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she said, standing on the edge of the forest. Her voice echoed in the brisk night air as Jim perked his head up in anticipation of her words. “Next time, don’t make it so obvious that you’ll run out of gas. I could see you glancing at the meter every few seconds. And for the love of Christ, don’t show your knife until you’re about to kill someone. It's reeks of amateurishness. Don't give a bad name for the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Jim nodded, giving her a thumbs up. “You got it! Maybe one day, I’ll show you how much I’ve improved. I'll earn my name as an established serial killer and make you proud.”</p>
<p>Jean fought back smiling herself. <em>Stupid as ever</em></p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said, melting into the safety of the foliage. “Maybe one day.” </p>

<p>The day my toilet disappeared while I was using it was the last straw.</p>
<p>I asked nicely. I even pleaded, but no amount of groveling would make my shitter reappear. As Bugs Bunny says, "'Dis means war."</p>
<p>A few days later, her SUV decided to take a walk. Literally. It rose on its hind wheels to take a lovely stroll down the street as my neighbor watched in bewilderment. She glared at me knowingly as it began to dance a jig, putting dents in the asphalt where it landed. It was some of my finest work, and I couldn't help but laugh as the black behemoth moved fluidly in ways it was never meant to go. </p>
<p>The next day I received flowers at work. This in itself is odd enough, but these flowers wouldn't stop multiplying. Every time I would take a bunch out, two bunches appeared in their place. Eventually my office was overrun by orchids and we locked the door in the hopes that it would stem the tide. The next morning, all of them had disappeared. If I didn't know better, I'd think she was flirting with me.</p>
<p>I retaliated by gifting her a pair of pants built around the smallest machines I was capable of creating. Of course, she knew I did <em>something</em> to them, but she didn't know what until I saw her in her garden. I clapped my hands and shouted, "MICHAEL JACKSON LIVES!" as loud as I could. The pants immediately jerked her upright and, from speakers I had hidden in the area, forced her through the entire dance line for 'Billy Jean', which was both entertaining and amazing. I'm fairly sure she already knew most of the moves, considering my pants had no effect on the rest of her body - yet she went along with it as if every motion was fluidly practiced. She smiled as it ended. I worried.</p>
<p>The back-and-forth battle intensified.</p>
<p>My morning coffee turned into a dove and flew away.</p>
<p>Her cell phone moved to a different counter every time she turned her back.</p>
<p>My wallet moved to a different pocket every time I reached to pay for something.</p>
<p>Her laptop spontaneously converted itself to a Mac and back every few hours.</p>
<p>My living room got turned into a full-size replica of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, complete with sweaters. </p>
<p>All the faucets in her house started spewing beer.</p>
<p>My refrigerator had everything inside of it turned to guacamole, then she invited herself over with a few pitchers of beer.</p>

<h1>[WP]: You thought being the only immortal in the world was the worst thing in existence. Then you found Greg.</h1>
<p>Score: 2068</p>
<p>Have you ever been burned alive?<br />
I have.<br />
Twice, in fact.<br />
The first was a witch burning in the middleages. The details leading to the event are irrelevant, but let me assure you that being <em>burned alive</em> is especially unpleasant. Being a <em>true</em> immortal meant that within a few days my corporeal body had reconstituted itself and I slunk away, naked, from that horrible little town - only to return twenty years later with a horde of mercenaries at my back and revenge on my mind.<br />
But as horrible as that experience was, it wasn't as bad as <em>Greg</em>.<br />
To give you a picture of just how terrible it was to meet Greg; I actually <em>set myself</em> on fire that second time, just to get away from him for a couple of days.<br />
Anyway, Greg.<br />
Being a true immortal is a  drag; nothing can truly kill me and thus I'm consigned to an eternal existence.<br />
Consider that for a moment.<br />
Think of <em>the</em> most boring time of your life to date, then imagine that moment yawning on for the rest of <em>eternity</em>. Now, bad as that sounds, at least that boredom is spent doing <em>something</em> - even if it's watching paint dry or grass grow. When this ball of gas and dirt stops spinning around the sun, <em>I will still be here</em> hovering in the supernova remnants and planetary dust, <em>even more bored</em>.<br />
This is a chilling thought, yes?<br />
So thought I, until I died in a head-on car crash.<br />
Crawling out of the wreckage of my car, I noticed the driver of the other vehicle doing the same.<br />
But the odd thing was, <em>he shouldn't have survived</em>.<br />
He was an immortal.<br />
And looking at my totaled car, he realised the same thing about me.<br />
"Holy fuckin shitballin crotchwarlocks!" he yelled, "You're a motherfuckin immortal!"<br />
Looking me up an down like a freshly dressed carcass, his smile grew even broader,<br />
"And you're a <em>girl!</em>"<br />
That's how I met Greg.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Now some of the other ladies out there may have had <em>unwanted</em> advances from gentlemen.<br />
You have my sympathies; for I had acquired someone in my life who could only be described as a <em>stalker</em>.<br />
Greg wasn't just persistent, he was like a fucking starving fly to a mountain of dogshit.<br />
I rebuffed him gently at first, which had no effect. Then I tried being abrupt.<br />
When being downright fucking <em>rude</em> didn't dissuade him, I had to get violent.<br />
Unfortunately for immortals like us, that really doesn't do much.<br />
The first time I killed Greg was by pushing him into traffic. A truck collected him and pasted him to the side of a warehouse, giving me enough time to catch a cab to a car yard, buy a vehicle and leave town.<br />
But I'm sure you see the problem here; because we immortals have <em>infinite time on our hands</em>.<br />
It took Greg two months to find me. His second death was a shotgun to the throat and his third and fourth were the same. In case you hadn't noticed, the guy was a slow learner.<br />
By the 80s, I'd killed the guy maybe three dozen times.<br />
He called it "playing hard to get". <br />
I called it a fucking <em>nightmare</em>.<br />
"Just fuck me, please! It'll be real good!" he whined as I'd fed him into the woodchipper - which would give me a few day's headstart on him while he regrew.<br />
No, no Greg. It wouldn't be good.<br />
While I'd used my immortality to learn hundreds of skills and master most of the arts, Greg had largely spent his eternity thus far sticking his penis in anything that would let him. One would <em>think</em> that might make him a good lover, but having spoken to one of his ex girlfriends, I came to the conclusion that he approached sex with the same finesse and skill that he used to court his lovers - i.e. <em>none</em>.<br />
I had to get more creative as the years ground on. The acid bath in the woods was a really good one; that gave me a good six months of peace - but then some stupid hiker had stumbled across it and tipped it over, releasing the goo that was Greg into the water table, where he reformed and came after me with renewed passion.<br />
Stupidly, I'd thought the volcano would sort him out for at <em>least</em> a few years; but enough of him got spewed out as ash to reconstitute and come after me like the world's horniest and stupidest labrador.<br />
I tried hermetically sealing him, launching him into space and burying him deep within the Earth.<br />
But, like some kind of sex-crazed, middle-school supervillain, he always managed to come after me.<br />
So that's it really.<br />
As if being immortal didn't fucking suck enough already, the universe cursed me with Greg.<br />
And we're stuck together.<br />
<em>Forever</em>.</p>

<p>The only way a burn gets to be lethal is when you have context.</p>
<p>Insulting a stranger isn’t going to do anything except singe a few eyebrows. You need to get to know a person, and they need to know you. You need to have a <em>history.</em></p>
<p>So you can say that the job is 90% charm, and 10% vitriol. </p>
<p><em>”What? You’re breaking up with me?”</em></p>
<p><em>I toss her a hundred dollar bill.</em></p>
<p><em>”Here’s a hundred dollars. Divide that over the time of our relationship and that makes you, what, a twenty-five cent an hour girl? Congratulations on being a literal two-bit whore.”</em></p>
<p><em>She bursts into flames. A day later at a dead drop, I pick up a duffel bag of cash.</em></p>
<p>The thing about burns is that they hurt so bad, people have stopped wanting to make friends. It’s made the job a lot harder. Everyone's always suspicious.</p>
<p>But a job’s a job, and they wouldn’t call me <em>assassin</em> if I didn’t try. Target’s name was Allegra Rosen, CEO of Edion Biomedical. Like most people who live in the teetering top edge of society, she closed herself off. She didn’t have an entourage of friends and family: she had assistants and secretaries.</p>

<p>“Hey, new guy. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Of course, ma’am.” </p>
<p>“Good, I wouldn’t want to have to throw your ass out on the street. You people are all expendable.”</p>
<p>My eyebrows singed but I kept my cool. </p>
<p><em>Good,</em> I thought. This is a job I would enjoy.</p>
<hr />
<p>There were a variety of tactics I employed to get in close with targets. </p>
<p>People might not have been very friendly, but they still craved sex. And sex still led to vulnerability, a kind of emotional connection that left them wide open to a burn that could erase them from the planet.</p>
<p>I showed up to work in increasingly more fashionable suits. I polished my shoes. My hair was immaculate. I exfoliated every day, and the gym was my life.</p>
<p>On the third week of work, the inevitable happened.</p>
<p>“What are you doing tonight?”</p>
<p>“Ma’am?”</p>
<p>“I want to fuck you, is that so bad? Are you free tonight?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>I wined and dined her at the Sky Lounge and she took me home still drunk on power and a bottle of 1950 red.</p>
<p>“Out of clothes. Into bed. <em>Now.</em>”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>She didn't mention my scars. </p>
<hr />
<p>I usually made sure I kept a relationship going for at least a month. Anything less and it wasn’t a clean kill.</p>
<p><em>I look her in the face. Her eyes are liquid, vulnerable.</em></p>
<p><em>I say, “You fuck about as well as you dance. And you dance like a Parkinson’s patient with epilepsy.”</em></p>
<p><em>The lower half of her body explodes into flame, and she screams into the night. Fourth-degree burns, lethal, but not lethal enough. She dies that day after 97 minutes of utter agony.</em></p>
<p>I started buying Allegra gifts. Little things. A tiny plushy cat. Cute little ribbons like her mom used to make. I kept notes in her lunch, telling her how she looked like some sort of greek goddess. </p>
<p>I liked to watch her blush when I looked through the glass partition. Not because I was sentimental. But because it meant this was <em>working.</em></p>
<p>By the end of our second month: “I want you to move in with me. I know I’m rushing it a little bit, I know it’s strange, but I can take care of you—and the house is huge, and you’d love it, I know you would.”</p>
<p>I never saw her so flustered. She wasn’t used to being so vulnerable. It was… endearing.</p>
<p>I packed my bags the next day.</p>

<p>Allegra’s change in demeanor shouldn’t have been a surprise. In a world where everyone was so guarded, it was the norm.</p>
<p><em>Week one: she refuses to acknowledge I’m in the room.</em></p>
<p><em>Week two: she responds to my questions with biting sarcasm.</em></p>
<p><em>Week three: she never makes the first move.</em></p>
<p><em>Week four: she caresses my skin in the mornings.</em></p>
<p><em>Week five: she’s ash.</em></p>
<p>Allegra ran her hands through my hair. She was a completely different person. In the office her eyes were hard-edged like chips of broken sapphire, but in the house they were like little lagoons warmed by a tropical sun. Her fingers traced the whorl in my hair. </p>
<p>“You are the best thing that’s ever happened to me. You know that?”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>She smiled that wide-mouthed smile. She never did that at work. It made her seem so beautifully human, so full of zest. What a pity that someone could lock up that kind of light and life in a vault of such abject <em>apathy.</em> </p>
<p>Allegra ran a finger down my cheek. “I’m such a lucky, lucky girl.”</p>
<p>“Not as lucky as I am.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Allegra took sixteen vacation days and we went to Turkey for the summer. We got on a sailboat and sailed the Aegean for two weeks. It was beautiful. </p>
<p>“Would you believe me if I told you I’d never seen the stars?”</p>
<p>Her face was full of such wonder, that first time we saw the band of the Milky Way. I’d seen it many times, but every time was like the first time. And seeing her face widen with that curiosity and grand sense of awe reminded me of myself. This girl was lovely inside, lovely.</p>
<p>When we went back to the Istanbul airport I was sorry to go, and Allegra kissed me on the hand and said we could go to better and more spectacular places.</p>
<p>“We have our whole lives ahead of us. We can see the whole world.”</p>
<p>We could.</p>
<hr />
<p>Worming your way into someone else’s life was a double-edged sword. It made them vulnerable to you, but if you got in deep enough, you’d get vulnerable to <em>them.</em> </p>
<p><em>It’s two weeks until I can kill her. She looks me in the eye, calls me a sociopathic fuck who no one can love.</em></p>
<p><em>The burns run up my right arm and up the back of my neck. It heals in two months, leaving a shiny, glabrous scar.</em></p>
<p>Allegra kissed me on the cheek. “Just five more days and bam, we go to Cambodia. You excited?” Her teeth are perfect pearls. “It’s going to be crazy. Angkor Whaaaaaaat?”</p>
<p>The night of our departure, we made love for hours. She hired a private plane—we slipped into bed there, too. When we got to Cambodia, we hardly had time to see the sights.</p>
<p>“I love you, I love you!” She’d bought out the whole suite, so she could afford to dance naked through the hall. “I love you!”</p>
<p>This was new. </p>
<hr />
<p>Our last night in Cambodia, she threw a party and invited everyone from her office. She had family members fly out too, and we all found ourselves on the rooftop of the hotel, milling around a pool and drinking champagne.</p>
<p>She told me to mingle, and I met her parents for the first time. They were lovely people. </p>
<p>Half-way through the night the crowd hushed and Allegra walked out of the elevator doors in a dress made to be photographed. Like someone wove mercury through silver and draped it around the perfect female form. She looked like she was sculpted.</p>
<p>Her walk was slow and deliberate, and she got down on one knee. The surrounding crowd gasped, and the adrenaline dialed my heartbeat to 185. </p>
<p>“Mike Green. Love of my life, gift from the gods.” Her eyes, those warm tropical pools. I could live in them. She cracked open a box and I saw the chrome and diamond wedding band. “Will you marry me?”</p>
<p>The crowd was silent. My heart was beating at a million miles a minute. Her smile was like a crescent moon.</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>And she disappeared in a puff of smoke and brimstone. </p>

<h1>[WP] A genius serial killer who has been killing successfully for a decade. With one weakness. He can never ever lie. He's finally gets caught and is facing trial for a murder in court. Yet, he walks, acquitted of all charges.</h1>
<p>Score: 2044</p>
<p>The key to my success has always been planning. I choose my victims months in advance, and work around the clock. Maps of their common haunts, and schedules showing where the victim will be at any given time. Charts of friends and family. Details of her job and boss and coworkers. Even her dirty secrets, discovered through keyloggers and blackmailing friends. And once I know her better than her own husband (I always choose married women), then I begin to plot the kill. I begin to get close to the victim, worming my way into her life. Making <em>her</em> obsessed with <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>And it works, every time. The box on my shelf rattles with twenty three wedding rings. A monument to planning for every possible contingency. And most importantly, planning to get caught. Most serial killers never expect it to happen. They're consumed by their hubris. They think they're special. <em>They</em> are the ones who will get away with it. Fools.</p>
<p>March 14, 2014: the day I was found. I was waiting in bed, unable to sleep. I heard the light patter of footsteps on my deck from tip-toeing black boots. I could barely contain my glee. The windows exploded inward, spraying shards of glass all over my perfectly clean apartment. The door to my bedroom splintered and buckled under the force of the battering ram. I was calmly sitting against my headboard with a pleasant smile and my hands clasped behind my head. The SWAT members looked a bit unnerved, and slapped the cuffs on me. They roughed me up a bit, and I squealed in pain as they expected. Not that I actually care; this will only help my defense. </p>
<p>I sat in court, watching the forensics investigators explain all of the evidence gathered from my home. The books that I'd published, full of eerily similar details that correspond to the killings. The maps and charts that I had prepared with facts that only the killer would know. The long unexplained travel absences. My journal, full of confessions about the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction that comes with a successful kill. The knives, stained with dried human blood. They called me to the stand, of course, but I pleaded the Fifth.</p>
<p>And then... the case began to fall apart. It's all part of being a fiction writer, my defense attorney explained. All research for my next work, which is entered into evidence. A first person perspective of a serial killer. Completely fictionalized, of course. The charts and maps were found to have grievous errors that the <em>actual</em> killer would not have made, including where the victim might be on the night of the murders. The charts had similar inaccurate details. My defense attorney explained that I did my best to piece the crimes together from news stories and a friend within the police department. Poor Jacob... his name was dragged through the mud and his career ruined, but he ended up corroborating my story. He was a necessary sacrifice. The journals were simply fictional, and contained no details about the actual cases.</p>
<p>The knives were my coup de grâce. What a <em>sloppy</em> killer I was, to leave physical evidence on the blades! If only I'd scrubbed harder! It's what the prosecutor called a "smoking gun." She took great pleasure in waving the weapon around the courtroom, detailing how I had sliced open the victim mercilessly. Then it was my turn. My attorney brought in the key surprise witness: a morgue employee that I had bribed. He let me in late one night to practice on an unnamed Jane Doe. I'd told him I was an author, and that I was interested in being able to vividly describe the sound and feel of a knife cutting into flesh. And it was the truth. I never lie. It's not quite the same when they're dead, but I enjoyed this bit of alibi building nonetheless.</p>
<p>I still remember the prosecutor's face after his testimony. She had nothing on cross-examination, and she could see her career going down the tubes. This was the most publicized trial the city had had in years, and she was completely blowing it. I wondered if she'd get fired for this. If not, I'd have to pull a few more strings. I gave her a sympathetic head nod and a barely-concealed smirk, and she couldn't hide the smoldering anger. </p>
<p>After the acquittal, we shook hands in front of a hundred flashing cameras. She put on her fakest smile and declared that justice had been served. She clenched my hand tighter and for a brief moment let the mask drop; she looked like she wanted to gag. With a wave to the reporters, she whispered into my ear: "I know you did it. And I'm going to stop you."</p>
<p>I continued shaking her right hand, eying the soft gold wedding ring on the other and picturing it in my collection. "You'll try," I told her. "Looking forward to seeing you again soon." I <em>really, really</em> was.</p>

<p>Already the early light of dawn was peeking over the mountains and there was still so much left to do. Before, in his younger days, a night’s worth of work could be finished long before the sun even hinted as to its existence, but it was getting more difficult every year. Creaks in the back, aches in the knees, pain all over, really. Down and up, down and up, all night long, he would be folding at his hips, gently putting the saplings in the ground. Every plant was exorbitantly expensive, each being so special that it needed its own special care with the key rule being to finish before sunrise.</p>
<p>From the west, the distant sounds of mechanized planters changed pitch. Greedier landowners, had, in recent years in the insatiable search for profit, begun to ignore the tactile needs of the plants and switched to the disgusting, growling, metal leviathans that scoured the fields. How little they cared, thought the bowed man, how disrespectfully they acted, how very much they valued their money. It was a lonely existence, planting the old way and discovering the plants were so needy and fragile and so requiring of your time, ensuring a long, lonely, aching life.</p>
<p>Joints, muscles, tendons, were giving out now. Knobbed knees sunk into the tilled soil. Light was pouring down, brilliant reds in the sky giving way to a clear blue dawn. Most of the plants were in the ground, but those that remained were, at this point, ruined. Never had the man failed a planting cycle, never in his 55 years of devotion to the soil. Over the horizon, the mechanized whine shuddered and stopped. Perhaps they have failed, thought the man, a vain hope that their failure would validate his waning abilities and act as a sign that he was not…finished. Quietly, the man took the remaining plants and ground them into a muddy, useless paste. Rage began to well inside of him and water crept into his eyes.  Seventy three years old and his life had suddenly ended. True, he still breathed, could move, could think, but as far as a purpose, a reason to live, his life was over. Under the sun, on the dirt, surrounded by an expanse of field, the man wept, defeated, arm reaching into his rear pocket to pull out his knife. Veins exposed by the night’s exertion and age pulsed beneath the exposed blade.[Weightlessness cradled the man as the years of dedication rolled off his shoulders and the faintest smile, the first in years, appeared on his face as he worked the knife.] X on his left wrist, then one quick pull across the throat before the knife was plunged into his heart. Years of labor and sweat and frustration and joy and love and hate flowed out with blood and splashed onto the ground, food for the last crop he would be responsible for. Zeroing in on the last point of light visible, the man fell forward, his eyes sliding closed as his last breath blew gently on a shoot of green.</p>

<h1>[WP] Cause of death appears to you as floating text over people's heads with no time indication. You start noticing a trend.</h1>
<p>Score: 2032</p>
<p>I stop noticing the causes after a while. They were boring. Lots of heart disease and various types of cancer. I was in college; those things were years and years down the road. Every once and a while, I'd see things like "suicide" or "automobile crash." Though sad and preventable, I had no real way of knowing when it would happen or why. So there was nothing I could do about it. </p>
<p>But some deaths were preventable, or changed based on new events in the world. On my way to class, I saw a young lady walking nearby with a cause that could be easily stopped: "Drug Overdose." I'm normally not one to reach out to strangers, but I figured I had to get involved. This was definitely a college-age cause of death. I ran across the quad and asked her out. She was shocked, but smiled shyly and accepted. Her name was Sarah, and her sign changed after about a month of us dating. Now, it says "dementia;" I still check every morning when I wake up. It's sad, but I take comfort in knowing we'll live a long life together.</p>
<p>After a few years, I learned to just tune the signs out. I had so much on my mind now. Work, baby on the way, mortgage, student loans... far too much for me to be worrying about how other people might die. Sure, I got involved when I could, but that wasn't very often. And who am I to thwart fate?</p>
<p>My boss entered my office with a new client folder and dumped it on my desk, on top of the 10 other folders requiring my attention. "Howard is out sick today," he informed me, "so you need to take this one." I rolled my eyes and looked up, ready to argue. But instead of the usual "heart attack" floating over his head, he had a new one. Bright green, like how I picture radioactive sludge. And it said "Plague."</p>
<p>I was too distracted to argue. I'd never seen a "plague" sign before. I stood up from my cubicle and glanced around the office at my coworkers. 7 of them had changed to "plague" as well. When had this happened?? As I watched, a secretary's red "suicide" sign changed to "plague" as well. </p>
<p>I hopped online looking for any news about some new disease or anything. Nothing. I searched for outbreaks and 'mystery' illnesses and any other search term I could think of. Nothing. Maybe it was a long way off. Maybe I had plenty of time. </p>
<p>I left early that day. I couldn't be in the office. As I walked to the subway station, I began to notice more and more green. And more and more people were changing by the minute. From the looks of it, the plague would already be killing about half of New York, and that number was growing. Nearby, someone coughed, with that disgusting hacking sound of fluid-filled lungs. I scrambled across the street in utter terror and ran the rest of the way home.</p>
<p>Sarah was working at her desk when I arrived. Thank god; her sign was unchanged. She wouldn't be infected, at least not yet. She rubbed her tummy with a smile as I entered. "I felt him kick today," she said, practically bursting with the news. I was too distracted to react; she was crestfallen. "We need to get out of town," I said, trying to hide the panic in my voice. Her face let me know that I was failing miserably. "What is it?" she asked. I had already made my way to the bedroom and started throwing things in suitcases. I didn't have time to argue.</p>
<p>We made our way down to the street to get a cab. I was lugging two enormous suitcases, and dragging Sarah behind me. She was confused and scared, but had agreed to come along. At least for now. Outside, the street was a sea of bright green. I heard more and more coughing. </p>
<p>We finally got into a cab. The driver had a bright green 'Plague' sign over his head. "Where to?" he asked. "JFK," I said. Well, 'shouted' would be more of an apt description.</p>
<p>As we drove, the thick haze of green changed suddenly to a bright purple that I'd never seen before. Almost every green sign was now gone; the few that remained were probably going to be the first outbreak victims. The purple letters spelled out "Nuclear explosion."</p>

<p>Score: 2004</p>
<p>Dr. Gloom checked his watch for the sixth time, before sighing and looking at the rest of the line. He always thought making money would be hard once he went straight, but nobody ever warned him about all the waiting. Normies spent so much of their life waiting in lines! Back in his glory days, he could have just walked up to the teller and <em>demanded</em> the cash. There weren't many Supers who had discovered their abilities yet, and nobody was able to stop him.</p>
<p>A small hand tugged at his sleeve, and he quickly remembered that those days were behind him now. "Yes, sweetie?" he asked his daughter, Nora.</p>
<p>"When will we be done, daddy? We've been here FOR-EV-ER!" she pouted.</p>
<p>"Soon, remember that patience is a virtue. Maybe the teller will have a nice lollipop for you, they still do that, right?" he looked up towards the teller and searched for any bowls filled with candy. All around him, he could feel the intense stares of hate and fear. They recognized him, they knew, and they did not forgive, even after 7 years. And why should they? He was <em>THE</em> Dr. Gloom, the original Super Villain. At least Nora didn't care who he used to be, and neither did her mother. That's all that mattered to him now. Even after defeating the Super Squad numerous times, it only took a simple woman to change his life for the better.</p>
<p>Nora was normal, just like her mother, at least he had that much to be thankful for. He knew that being a Super meant being an outcast, and ostracized by society. Even many of the Heroes were  ridiculed and condemned as monsters.</p>
<p>"Daddy, it's your turn!" cheered Nora, and the doc snapped back to focus. He apologized and stepped up to the teller. "Yes, I-" he was interrupted by a large explosion by the entrance.</p>
<p>"I'm here to make a withdrawal!" shouted a large man wearing a firefighter's suit, as he stepped over the burning remnants of the front door. Shortly after, his two companions walked in on either side of him. The first was a short, stocky man who wore goggles on top of his head. The other man was massive, and seemed to be made of stone.</p>
<p>"You Normies can call me Pyro!" said the not-firefighter. He snapped his fingers together and produced a small flame, which he used to light a cigarette. Then he waved his hand to the small man at his side, "This here's Sparky."</p>
<p>"Oooh it looks like they've upgraded their ATMs to the newest models, these ones have one-point-five times the capacity of the previous ones!" Sparky said with glee as he ran to the nearest ATM.</p>
<p>"He talks too much." said Pyro, shrugging. "This other guy is Brick, he don't talk much at all."</p>
<p>"Hmph." grunted Brick, as he cracked his knuckles.</p>
<p>All of the Normies laid down on the ground, almost routine for some of them. Dr. Gloom, however, simply leaned down to tell Nora to join the others, before he turned to face the intruders. "I'm sorry, fellas, but you'll have to wait in line. Patience is a virtue, after all." he said calmly, while observing the misfit crew of wannabe Villains. "Some of us have to work for a living."</p>
<p>"Sparky, focus on those ATMs, and keep jamming the cell phones, we don't need cops showing up just yet." commanded Pyro. "I'll handle the teller. Brick... uh, just do your thing buddy."</p>
<p>"Hmph." grunted Brick, as he charged at the doc with a raised fist.</p>
<p>Although he wasn't as quick as he used to be, Dr. Gloom was still ready for a fight. Brick crashed through the pillar behind his target at full speed, causing chunks of rubble to plummet down onto his head.</p>
<p>"Hmph." grunted Brick, as he slipped into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>"Looks like the big guy needed a nap." remarked Dr. Gloom.</p>
<p>"What just happened? He phased right through you!" Exclaimed Sparky in shock.</p>
<p>"Well if you want to get technical, <em>I</em> phased through <em>him</em>." replied the doc with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Forget the cash, Sparky, let's toast this old man!" Pyro grabbed a large ax off of his back, and Sparky lowered the goggles over his eyes.</p>
<p>Before he knew it, Dr. Gloom was dodging balls of fire and bolts of electricity. All he had to do was distract them until their attacks set off the sprinkler system. It seemed easy, until Sparky overloaded a nearby ATM and caught him off guard. He tried to get back up, to gather his energy, but it was too late. Pyro stood above him now, ax in hand. "All these old Supers keep thinking they can beat the new breed. We are better, faster, stronger. You're just an old man." He raised the ax above his head.</p>
<p>"Get away from my daddy!" Shouted a voice from across the room. Nora had found the fire alarm, and pulled it as hard as she could. Suddenly water sprayed from the faucets all around the room. At first, Pyro's suit protected him from the water, but he was standing too close to Sparky, and got a shocking surprise.</p>
<p>Dr. Gloom got back on his feet, and smiled to his daughter across the room. "What is every Super Villain's weakness?"</p>
<p>Nora knew the answer. "Monologues."</p>

<p>It's been ages. I haven't gotten any blips since before my marriage, not even from my now-ex. I'll admit it, I let myself go a bit when her and I got serious but the looks decent wagon didn't exactly pass me by. I used to get a couple a day in college but they were usually from people I barely socialized with.</p>
<p>The lack of blips put a strain on my marriage. The storm really came to a head when I was trying to talk to Angela about our dead bedroom and how she doesn't even play to the thought of me anymore. She told me, "Well what the fuck does it matter? I know you're getting off daily."</p>
<p>A lot more was said, mainly her calling me a fat pig and me dropping the C-bomb. I left that night and stayed with my brother, Shawn. I talked with him about getting my fitness back on track and he gave me some pointers: eat less crap, hit the gym, track calories, all of that stuff. I didn't see much progress in the first couple of months until I decided to put on my big girl panties and really grind it out. In the mornings I'd run a couple of kilometres as fast as I could, cut out processed food, and lifted weights in the evening. My food staples were veggies, chicken, fish, and rice. I set goals for when I hit the iron.</p>
<p>A month on, I needed to buy a new belt. Another month, new clothes. I felt amazing. More energy, more confidence, better sleep, and I didn't even care about the blips that I wasn't getting at that point. I had actually forgotten all about it. I was too focused on making myself better, the best I could be. Faster. Stronger. The Iron Temple was my place of worship, and I devoted to it my body, mind, and soul.</p>
<p>Then, eight months from the start of my journey, I got a blip one morning. I was nervous. I didn't check it at work. I didn't check it on my way home. I waited until I was in the bedroom of my new apartment, my heart in my throat. I opened the app.</p>
<p>"Shawn has just masturbated to you!"</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the kind comments, y'all are rock stars. Just like to clarify that the main character is male, I used the line "big girl panties" because it's a thing that people say to guys who need to "man up". </p>

half.</p>
<p>“Scott, you're telling me this is the first time you see an ostrich?” Asks him, the golden chains clinking as he walks 
my way.</p>
<p>I say the word ostrich and this place is run down by a SWAT team faster than you can say... well, ostrich. But he 
doesn't know that, of course. To him, ostrich is just his freaking pet.</p>
<p>What's wrong with having a golden retriever, for God's sake?</p>

<p>“Jesse is not an emu. She's an ostrich. Understood?”</p>
<p>“The money is right by Jesse's side, on my briefcase.”</p>

<p>“What is Jesse, Scott?”</p>
<p>“What?” </p>
<p>I don't have a gun. A SWAT team storms this hotel room, exchanging fire with these dealers, and I'm like a 
bleached asshole in the middle of a dick and cock mingle.</p>
<p>Meaning I'm fucked.</p>
<p>“Jesse. Is. Not. An. Emu. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“I do, Mr. Morelo. Very much so. Let's just make the trade, ok?”</p>
<p>“No.” He waves to his guys, “Bring me Jesse.”</p>
<p>Have you ever seen an ostrich walking across a hotel room filled with cocaine, money and drug dealers while trying

<p>“No, sir, it's not.” It's an ostrich.</p>

<p>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.</p>
<p>“It's an... ostrich. Fuck it, it's an ostrich! Ostrich! Ostrich! They have guns! OSTRICH, OSTRICH, OSTRICH!”</p>
<p>Nothing. And, of course, they look at me like I'm crazy.</p>
<p>“Ostrich!”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Morelo asks, but it's just to be polite, seeing as his partner is already unbuttoning my shirt 
and has found the recorder, and the guns are already pointed at me.</p>
<p>“OSTRICH! What the fuck? Ostrich!”</p>
<p>And just as the guns are cocked, I remember.</p>
<p>Alpaca. It was alpaca. Not ostrich.</p>
<p>Alpaca.</p>
<p>Why did I think it was ostrich?</p>
<p>“Shoot him.”</p>
<p>I could have said 'alpaca' before they opened fire. I don't know why I didn't. If I had to take a guess, I'd say it's 
cause I thought I deserved it, in a way.</p>
<p><em>I'm gonna die because of alpacas and ostriches, I think, as Jesse stares at me from above. Is this blood on my shirt? Who messes up alpacas for ostriches, anyway?</em></p>
<p>This idiot, that's who.</p>

<p>Score: 1925</p>
<p>We sat quietly in the back of the boat while Charon slowly ferried us across the Acheron. Gertrude stared down at the waters below, where souls of the damned who couldn't afford the crossing were forever trapped in the muddy depths. She was really quite beautiful; not at all what I'd been expecting after Satan's offer. I mean, he'd promised me the world in exchange for taking her out on a date. I'd expected her to look... well, like him. Goat hooves and horns and red skin and everything. But she was just a normal girl. </p>
<p>"So... you grew up here in Hell?" I asked.</p>
<p>Gertrude adjusted her glasses and shrank back like she was scared of the sound of my voice. "Yes," she answered meekly, then turned back to look at the water again. I rolled my eyes and checked my watch. This was going to be harder than I thought. </p>
<hr />
<p>"Well, I wanted to study marine biology," she said, picking at her pork chop, "But Daddy didn't want me to. Said that there's no water in Hell anyway except for the river. Water would give the damned hope, or something like that. I don't know."</p>
<p>"Why not just move away from Hell?"</p>
<p>Gertrude scoffed looked at me with a quivering smile. "Daddy would never let me do that. He tells me about all of the terrible things that you mortals do to each other and how they would kill and rape me as soon as I stepped out into the street alone. He says that Earth is a horrible place." </p>
<p><em>You are from HELL</em>, I wanted to tell her. <em>How could EARTH be worse than that?</em></p>
<p>"It's really not that bad," I told her. "Sure, some people are bad, but it's only a few. You just see the worst of the worst because of, well, you know."</p>
<p>She took a sip of water and wiped her mouth. I had to admit, she had excellent manners; I'd expected an utter boor after meeting her dad. "I suppose that's true," she answered.</p>
<p>"You should try living here for a while. It seems like that's what you would want. You could get away from all that fire and brimstone and torture for a while. It's really quite pleasant! There's a lot to see!"</p>
<p>For a moment, she looked like she might cry. Then she went back to picking at her dinner.</p>
<p>"Daddy would never allow it."</p>
<hr />
<p>After our meal, we went to the beach. I brought a blanket and candles and a bottle of wine. She was nervous as first, but as soon as she got her shoes off and dug her toes into the soft sand, she was a different person. Bubbly and friendly. She laughed and joked and I chased her through the surf until we both collapsed into the sand, completely out of breath. It was almost hard to believe that this is the same person I'd picked up from Hell only a few hours ago.</p>
<p>"You've really never been to the sea before?" I asked her.</p>
<p>She gazed out at the waves. "No," she said. "I've only read about it. Daddy doesn't let me out very much." She bit her top lip, and I thought I saw a tear. Maybe it was just ocean spray. "It's beautiful though. Better than I ever imagined. Thank you for bringing me."</p>
<p>She turned to me and planted a kiss on my lips. I don't know which one of us was more surprised; she shrank back like I was a snake and covered her mouth with her hands. Her eyes were wide with shock.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry!" she uttered. "I would never normally do that!"</p>
<p>I laughed, pulled her hand away, and kissed her again.</p>
<hr />
<p>I returned to hell around midnight. Satan greeted me at the gate. </p>
<p>"I did it," I told him. "I took her out, and we had a lovely time."</p>
<p>He nodded. "Good. She's been getting restless in here; I had to do something. Hopefully this will keep her satisfied for a few hundred years."</p>
<p>I stayed silent.</p>
<p>"Well, name your price. Whatever you want."</p>
<p>I smiled. "I already got what I want. I only came back to let you know that we're all settled up. Thanks for everything, sir."</p>
<p>I turned and left. Only then did Satan notice that Gertrude hadn't returned to Hell with me. She was waiting back at my apartment. </p>

<p>Mortars thud outside the bunker, and I remove my cybernetic enhancements and crush them beneath my boot heel. I can leave no trace of my true origins; that could ruin everything I have built. I am a stone, sinking to the bottom of the pond. But I have made my ripples in time, and that is enough. Regardless of how history remembers me, my job is done. And in only twenty one years! Far ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>I die a monster. I know that. The world will forever spit at the mention of my name. Exactly as my commanding officer told me when he ordered me into the tachyon displacement field and sent me more than a century back. "You have to prepare us," he gasped, nursing the shard of steel impaled in his side. He handed me the folder that was meant for him, full of schematics for jets and rockets and a political analysis of Europe. "You need to prevent the German Dissolution of 1941 and ensure a world-wide military buildup. It's all in the briefing. <em>Do what must be done</em>." Without waiting for a response, he closed the shield door and turned on the machine. I watched helplessly through the thick porthole as the brick walls disintegrated and the Hunters burst in and tore him to shreds. They were too late to stop me, though.</p>
<p>I rushed it, and almost ruined everything. They now call it the "Beer Hall Putsch." My first attempt at seizing the government, and it failed miserably. But I was not one to give up, knowing that the Hunter fleet was already on its way. I redoubled my efforts, building a political network from inside prison walls and writing my propaganda masterpiece. I watched the Weimar Republic edge closer and closer to its own destruction, knowing full well that it would end with the death of German industry, extending the world's economic depression and stunting scientific development for the next fifty years. It needed to be prevented at all costs.</p>
<p>I was able to seize control, building a cult of personality around myself and brainwashing Germany's citizens. I rebuilt the economy and began pouring investments into the military. Certain scientists were entrusted with the schematics that I had brought back and began to develop a number of useful weapons. Missiles, jet engines, computing machines, harnessing the power of the atom... it would soon come to fruition. The Hunters' own weapons would be turned against them.</p>
<p>I was naive enough to believe that the world would let me build my army in peace, but I was at the very least adaptable. The British, weak-willed and isolationist in my own time, were (to my surprise) amazingly resilient and stubborn. I only wish that this "Winston Churchill" had been born a century later. I should have liked to hear the speech he would give when the Hunters took up positions in our orbit.</p>
<p>When I saw the stormclouds of war on the horizon, I used it to my advantage. Germany may burn, but I would ensure that the rest of the world carried on my vision, even if they didn't know it. I fanned the flames of distrust between the Soviets and the Americans, starting with the joint German/USSR invasion of Poland. I ordered my most trusted weapons engineers out of the country, telling them to make it look like they were defecting. Their research was too precious to keep here, knowing that the other nations of the world would soon make me a target. And I whispered into the ear of my new Japanese allies, urging them ever onward. In my own timeline, their territorial ambitions had stopped at Korea and they became peaceful (albeit weird) citizens of the world.</p>
<p>There were casualties, of course. My own German soldiers, and the many citizens of my conquered nations. All pawns in a giant game of chess, and sometimes sacrifices must be made. It broke my heart to give the order, but I instituted full-scale persecution of the Jews. They were the only logical target. Their culture is built on a history of persecution and insecurity, and I was the straw that broke the camel's back. Their leaders, spiritied away to newly-established Israel, vowed never to be left defenseless again. Their Irgun forces are ruthless and efficient, just as I'd hoped. My agents in Palestine are already setting the ground work for a lasting conflict there to ensure that the Middle East will be embroiled in war for at least a decade.</p>
<p>My time now is at an end, and I see the fruits of my labor around the world. Rocket-powered planes are under development in nations across the world. The United States is adapting my own V2 designs now, and they'll probably make it to space within the next decade or two. The Atomic Bomb, the heart of our dream arsenal against the Hunters, is ready for use. And best of all, I can already see the tensions forming between the allies. Russians and Americans vying for territory, carving out their own spheres of influence. The next few decades will be fraught with danger and peril, but humans will emerge ready for the true test of their valor: when the Hunter fleet emerges from the shadows. I can only imagine what terrifying weapons of war we will have available by then.</p>
<p>I can hear the thumping on the door of the bunker now, and I prepare to take my own life. I burn the folder in front of me, detailing the journey of U-815 into Antarctica. If I leave any evidence of this submarine, the Americans and Russians will sink it and leave it at the bottom of the sea. I've planted a final gift for the Hunters deep under the ice, set to emerge in 2066. My scientists never understood why I wanted to create this, but they did as they were told. An engineered virus, specifically targeting Hunter physiology. Humans will be completely immune. I've left a message in the cannisters, detailing all of my plans and what I knew. Maybe someday, I'll be recognized as a savior.</p>
<p>With that last pleasant thought in my mind, I load the gun and put the barrel against my temple.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>April 3: The itch is back. Can no longer hear #15's scream as clearly in my mind. Recordings just are not the same. Time to find another. Maybe around where #7 worked, that seemed like a spot with good potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>April 5: No luck yet. Good targets but too much activity. Must be especially careful now, as the police are making progress. What they will call me? Will check around #11's parents' neighborhood tomorrow.</p>

<li>
<p>April 17: Confirmed target has no contact with #11's parents, good. The police have figured out that #4 worked at the same place as #9. Perhaps too risky to have done that...but #9 was worth it. So very worth it.</p>

<p>May 22: Can predict target's every move; reconnaissance complete. Time to perform extensive background check, make sure there are no random links for the police to find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May 28: Seems to be clean. Complications, however. #11's parents spoke to the police and now the neighborhood is crawling with obstacles. Will have to delay action until the presence has dissipated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>June 6: Police have concluded that #11 is a dead-end. Precision does pay off. Target's patterns have not changed in the interim. By this time tomorrow, target will officially be #16.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>June 7: Plans on halt. #9's funeral is today. Cannot resist urge to attend. #16 will have to wait one more day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>June 8: #16...is gone. Only left to attend #9's funeral for a matter of hours. #9 looked as beautiful as always. But #16 is gone. Car left in the driveway, hydrangeas unwatered in the garden, front door locked. Does not make sense. Must be patient. Must make sense of situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>June 11: Still no sign of #16. No activity around house whatsoever. Did not show up for work. No books from the library. No groceries from the store. Disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>June 25: Should simply find another target, forget about #16. Police have given up on the case after #9's funeral. No chance of being caught unless a mistake is made. Trying to find #16 would be a mistake. But #16 was perfect. Perfect.</p>

Then eight. Growing, and growing, and growing, swarming over moons and through gas giants. Destroying everything in its path. Burning through resources as though tomorrow would never come. And killing its host: Earth itself had become a mined-out husk, and Mars was on its way to the same fate.</p>
<p>Our strategy had been containment. Every probe and ship sent out was destroyed as soon as it emerged from the Oort cloud. We didn't like the idea, but it was better than humans overrunning every other peaceful system in the galaxy. We were doctors, stopping the cancer from infecting the rest of galaxy. Sometimes, though, it just felt like we were throwing rocks at a beehive. The number of probes continued to grow. Sol was a swollen tumor, ready to burst. And if they ever discovered who had really stopped those probes...</p>
<p>But that is all in the past. In the end, it turned out that the humans were the lesser of evils. The Kahi cut through us like a knife, seizing our homeworld in less than a year. Getting cancer doesn't seem so bad when you're already dying of stab wounds, right? Hell, maybe it could even help.</p>
<p>The humans seemed so shocked when we landed. After all those years of imagining what aliens were like in their movies, they hadn't even come close to picturing it. I still remember the ship door opening to the sight of gun barrels. Typical humans. "I come in peace," I'd told them (well, my computer did, at least), in perfect English. That's what they would have wanted; those movies sure are helpful.</p>
<p>I presented my terms to the United Nations Congress. Technological aid, weapons, maps of the universe, and all sorts of other benefits. I even pointed them right to a great star system that they would love, full of arable land and fishable seas. Conveniently near the Kahi colonies... </p>
<p>Did they know they were being played? Possibly. Maybe they just didn't care. They offered me and the remnants of my civilization shelter, living in their polar regions. Antarctica was the perfect climate for my people. And they didn't seem to like it very much anyway. It was just the right size for what remained of our species. </p>
<p>When they encountered the Kahi, it was a bloodbath. Dozens of worlds lost at once. World leaders pounded their fists and demanded retribution. The great docks in orbit churned to life, pouring out starships like they were baking cookies. Even as I was revolted at the way they chewed through their own asteroid belt for resources, I was impressed at their resolve and determination. They asked if we knew of these Kahi; we told them only barely. Just enough to tell them all about their technology and physiology; everything they would need to carry on a war. Perhaps they will discover our lie when they find the ruins of our homeworld; perhaps not. But they are not wrathful enough to massacre us because of a tiny lie. They'll rant and they'll rage, and maybe expel us from our new city in Antarctica. It won't really matter; at least we'll be able to go home.</p>

<p>The belief clicks into place in their minds and another power clicks into place in mine.  All around me, I see black ribbons, pathways I can walk through to reach another pool of shadows.  I teleport behind the two guards at the exit, and vanish deeper into Dr. Noc's lair.</p>
<p>The warehouse was an easy place to be Nighthawk, plenty of shadows and hiding places, but now that I'm in the lair itself it'll be a bit harder.  The Doctor's labs are more brightly lit and more enclosed.  I need a new guise.</p>
<p>A patrolling guard gives me the opportunity.  The belief from the henchmen a floor above gives me enough strength and skill to yank him around a corner and knock him unconscious.  I grab his radio and speak.  "Everyone, Nighthawk and Paragon are in the building!  We need backup!  We need-" I cut the transmission.  That should draw some attention.</p>
<p>I take off my cloak, revealing a bright gold and blue uniform.  I shed the winglike cowl and replace it with a classic domino mask.  Immediately, I can feel strength fill my limbs.  Paragon is an unstoppable, invincible bruiser, and I crash through the Doctor's elite guards with ease.</p>
<p>As I fight, I'm pleasantly surprised to find that I can fly.  Paragon is so similar to all the classic "flying brick" superheroes that they're starting to get me mixed up with them.  I reach Dr. Noc's inner sanctum and kick down the door.</p>
<p>Something hits me in the gut.  Pain lances through me like a red-hot poker and I fall on my back, clutching my chest.  Dimly I realize, <em>I've been shot.</em>  The Paragon uniform has Kevlar underneath, just in case I get shot while setting up my persona, but either it didn't stop the bullet or the impact was just that strong.  My vision clears, and I see the Doctor and two henchmen with assault rifles standing over me.</p>
<p>"See?  I told you, he's weak against depleted phlebotinum bullets.  You'll have no trouble disposing of him now."</p>
<p>I stare up at the grinning Doctor as he steps towards me.  "You knew?" I gasp.</p>
<p>"Oh yes.  All I had to do was tell my henchmen that you had a secret weakness, and your own powers did the work.  They believe their bullets will hurt you, and they do."</p>
<p>"How...?"</p>
<p>"How did I know?  A few clues.  None of the members of Justice Fist were ever seen in the same place, for one.  That charade of 'taking a divide and conquer strategy' didn't hold up for long.  Talking to Mr. Hammer's former henchmen revealed that Nighthawk never made his entrance until someone saw his symbol.  Tricks like that."</p>
<p>He's got me dead to rights.  The Paragon guise is ruined, and I can't change my costume in plain view.  Or can I?  Inspiration strikes.</p>
<p>"Clever," I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. "But not clever enough.  Did you really think that this was a one-man show?  You think I was stupid enough to build a whole super-team on a lie?"</p>
<p>I see a flicker of concern cross his face. "Think about it. Nighthawk and Arbiter carry all those gadgets, but you never asked who built them.  You never realized I had an actual super-scientist on the team."</p>
<p>I roll to one side, revealing that I've pulled a small black box with a red button from my utility belt.  "You never realized that some of these powers were for real."</p>
<p>I glance up at the henchmen, still holding me at gunpoint. "I've got two words for you goons:  Forcefield generator."</p>
<p>"It's a bluff!  Shoot him!  Shoot him!"</p>
<p>Too late.  I can feel the belief snap down in their minds, and a light on the box turns green as their belief gives it power.  I push the button and a flickering blue dome springs into being around me.  Their bullets patter off it like rain.</p>
<p>Seizing the advantage, I grab a syringe from my belt, full of a mysterious blue liquid.  Like the Red Button, it's a bluff, only given power because they believe in it.  I slam it into my arm, and a dozen half-remembered movies about secret supersoldier projects flicker through their brains.  Their belief becomes a burst of healing and strength that cures the bullet wound.  I execute a kipup and land in a fighting stance, glaring at the henchmen.</p>
<p>"Still think I'm just a fake?"</p>
<p>EDIT: Obligatory "Holy cow I got gold?" edit.  Thank you, you're too kind.</p>

<h1>[WP] The Joker is set loose on the world of 1984. What happens? (x-post r/AskReddit)</h1>
<p>Score: 1879</p>
<p>They say in this day and age it is impossible to stay hidden. He did it though. When everybody knows that everyone is watched every single moment of their pitiful lives, it makes those in charge even more afraid of the man who isn’t. The Bat. He seeks to help the people of this world, by hiding in the darkness to show it can be done. To give the world a symbol, a beacon of hope. But while he prefers the darkness, people like me…..well, we prefer the SPOTLIGHT!!!! Because for every man there is a woman. For every cat there is a dog.  For every prisoner, a jailer. And for every Knight………..A Joker.</p>
<p>You see, I was special. My father was a very important man in the government so I was allowed certain freedoms that others were not. Namely I was allowed to find love. Others were not, It was treated as a disease, a sickness. But not me. I found her when we were only children, Harleen, She was from Eurasia, and I would have my father order her over in the name of international cooperation. She was always so nice to me. She used to say that if we were such good friends and I was always so happy to see her why I didn’t smile more. People here do not smile. It is considered abnormal, pervasive. When we were sixteen we had our first night together, it was everything I thought it would be until…….</p>
<p>The next morning I awoke to the sounds of my door being busted down. Four men burst in and grabbed Harleen. They said that I was fraternizing with the enemy. How could she be the enemy she was from Eurasia, they had been our closest allies for years. They claimed otherwise, they claimed EastAsia was our allies and that my father and I were aiding the enemy. We were all taking to a place no man dare mention. We were tortured, brainwashed tortured again, and by the time we were let out not one of us survived. Our bodies may have been alive but what made us who we were was no longer there. </p>
<p>Years passed by, allies came and went and came once more. Laws were added, words were stolen and I did not care. I had lost the ability to care. I just went through my day on auto-pilot, Day after Day after Day. They say a man can lose himself this way, but if that man is already lost does that mean he could find himself again? I did.</p>
<p>It had been nearly ten years since I last saw her, but as I was on my way to work I saw her sitting in an alley. I saw what they had done to her. It was here that I found myself…..a version of myself anyway. I bent down and looked her in the face and I did the only thing I could think to do. I smiled. I smiled and from that point on I never stopped smiling. It was then I realized that this world had become a powder keg and that I was going to be that spark. The bat had been active for a year now. If he could help people in the darkness, I could help them in the light. Showcase the atrocities of this world. I was wrong.</p>
<p>Harleen and I met the bat two months into our venture. As I came to learn, he was not some freedom fighter set out to help people. He was a criminal employed by the powers that be to satiate those facets of our personality that lead to rebelling. I felt betrayed; I felt true anger for the first time in years, After that I never stopped feeling anger. I realized that we were not the freaks, they were. They were the ones who were sick, diseased and needing to be stamped out. I had my mission now, my purpose, TO KILL THE BAT AND ALL THOSE WHO STAND IN MY WAY!</p>
<p>So that is my story. Pretty boring huh? I would let Harley tell you but she usually kills people afterwards. I want you to live, to live and to tell those that come after you, like I have told those that came before, of The JOKER. No mask, not an alien, not an experiment gone wrong. I am the product of humanity, born of this planet and its people and I will be its downfall. Big Brother made me and now I will unmake you all.</p>

<h1>[WP] Thor is sitting at a diner finishing a meal. A waitress comes by and casually picks up Mjolnir to wipe off the table.</h1>
<p>Score: 1874</p>
<p>"Brother, I do not see why you bother with these mortal establishments." Loki whispered in a disdainful voice. "We could be feasting in the halls of our father with endless servants loading our plates with freshly roasted boar. Rather than these... what are these?"</p>
<p>"They are called pancakes. I'm quite fond of them, here try this." Thor reached over and grasped the syrup and poured it over the circular cakes, filling the edges of the plate and dripping over the side.</p>
<p>Loki narrowed his eyes in suspicion. "Go on. Try it. Does the god of tricks fear being tricked?" Loki took his fork and stabbed into the pancake, cut off a small perfect square and ate only a single bite. He crewed, examining the flavor and texture in his mouth.</p>
<p>He did not communicate pleasure, but he ate the rest of the square and began eating the rest of the meal. Thor had brought Loki to so many little inconspicuous ventures that the humans had. This was Thor's part in Loki's rehabilitation. Odin had ordered Loki to go and find what made the humans froth forward to the joys of life. Thor was there just to make sure he actually experienced something and did not try anything as foolish as escape.</p>
<p>To mortals, they looked like average truckers. Mjolnir sat next to Loki's plate getting syrup spilled under it, the hammer would not allow itself to be contaminated.</p>
<p>The friendly woman who served them came back over. "Hey guys, how're the pancakes?"</p>
<p>"They are delightful, thank you." Thor spoke through a smile.</p>
<p>"They are... acceptable." Loki surprisingly blurted out.</p>
<p>"So, I was wondering is there a con in town?"</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Thor said "What is a con?"</p>
<p>"A con... a convention? I thought you two would be going to one dressed like that."</p>
<p>"Dressed like what?"</p>
<p>"In armor, and all that, you look a bit like that Thor fella. Is that who you are dressed as?"</p>
<p>Loki slowly looked up at the woman. His tricks fooled gods most of the time, but here was a mortal seeing right through one of his most powerful disguises.</p>
<p>While Thor and Loki stared blankly at her in surprise, she looked down at the table and noticed the syrup slowly flowing to the edge and threatening to leap to the ground.</p>
<p>She grabbed her rag, "Oh, so sorry for this mess." She began wiping the table. Loki and Thor met eyes and shook their heads in wonder. The waitress wiped the syrup back to the plate and reached for the hammer to clean under it. Thor instinctively reached out to stop her, but the woman picked it up as if it were nothing and wiped underneath it.</p>
<p>Thor looked up, once again at the woman who smiled back at him.</p>
<p>"Y'all are kind of quiet. But you're welcome."</p>
<p>"And I thank you. Sorry for any rudeness. May I ask, what is your name?"</p>
<p>"Oh." She said, she pointed to her nametag. "The name is Hebe."</p>
<p>"That is an unusual name." Loki said, inspecting this newly interesting woman.</p>
<p>"Its an old greek name. Anyway, hope you guys have fun with whatever you're doing. I got more people to serve."</p>
<p>And with that, she walked away. "See Loki. The mortals aren't always so boring."</p>
<p>"And I was just beginning to find pancakes intriguing."</p>

<p>I went about my usual routine, deep below the ground in my cold war era bunker.<br />
Technically it wasn't mine; it had belonged to some billionaire and I'd read about it in a Time magazine years ago. In the chaos of the Outbreak, I made my way there and had planned to beg entry, offering my services as an electrician and all-round handyman.<br />
Well, that hadn't been needed in the end; their bodies sat in the back of the subterranean wine cellar, mummifying in the still air down there.<br />
The TV hadn't picked up a signal in 30 years but I still liked to sit in front of it; powered still by the miniature hydroelectric plant in the catacombs beyond the cellar. The flickering static and the gentle hissing noises through the old speakers were compelling and comforting.<br />
My steps echoed down the empty, opulent corridors of the richly appointed apocalypse shelter. Dust lay thick everywhere that I didn't walk. Who had time for cleaning? Besides, there were dozens of rooms, along with the driving range and the swimming pool - both fallen into decay. Only frogs and algae lived in the stagnant waters now.<br />
The library was one of my other haunts. Weak electric light flickered behind the stained glass windows, giving the impression of a dying sunset - or the flames of the apocalypse. I had never decided which.<br />
Like the TV though, the light offered comfort and I often found myself drawn here.<br />
Pictures of the rich family still littered the bunker. John and Sarah, oil barons from Texas or somesuch. I couldn't really remember. I paused in front of a dusty mirror, startled by my own reflection - just as I had been thousands of times before - then realised my mistake and wandered on.<br />
I had no idea how long it had been now; time really had lost all meaning to me in my palatial exile. It could have been ten years, it could have been two. It could have been forty.<br />
Only one room was really 'my' room. At first I'd moved between them, but this one seemed like it was <em>mine</em>. I guess it reminded me of my childhood bedroom; the zoetrope constantly casting fanciful shadows around the spaceship wallpaper and the bunkbeds speaking of simpler times.<br />
One of the resident rats scuttled out and attempted to nip me but I carelessly put my foot down; breaking its spine and leaving it paralysed.<br />
A sound echoed down the corridor and caught my attention.<br />
<em>What was that?</em><br />
Turning, I ignored the twitching rodent and made for the stairs to the upper levels.<br />
There is was again. A definite sound - a <em>new</em> sound.<br />
Hurrying now, I stumbled up the stairs in my haste, reaching the landing as I heard more alien sounds.<br />
<em>Voices?</em><br />
Yes, voices!<br />
How long had it been since I'd heard voices? I didn't know.<br />
My own vocal cords worked to respond but it had been too long since they had been used.<br />
<em>"Footprints!</em> There's someone down here!" yelled an excited voice.<br />
Another responded,<br />
"Shit, <em>thirty years</em> someone's been down here?" came a reply - a woman's voice.<br />
"Yeah, some poor bastard has been here twenty years longer than they needed."<br />
I hurried towards the laughter and the light of their electric torches. <br />
Then they were in front of me, shocked by my sudden appearance.<br />
<em>"Holy shi-"</em> started the woman, but was cut off as I gouged open her throat with my exposed jaws.<br />
The man went next; his face raked open with my skeletal fingertips, blinded. The last tried to run but I lashed out and snagged his hip, tearing open cloth and flesh, slowing him down considerably.<br />
As he hobbled frantically away from me, yelling in terror, my new family member rose behind me, her half-severed head lolling to one side.<br />
I grinned in bloody, mummified joy.<br />
My isolation was over.</p>

<p>Score: 1822</p>
<p>His name was Werner Grenwald, and he had thirty-two perfectly aligned teeth.</p>
<p>I got to know this pleasant fact because the first time I met him, he was screaming. From the moment they brought him in until the moment I finally escorted him out, he did not stop screaming.</p>
<p>Instead we took lunch in my office on the third floor. He was still in cuffs, of course, but I had the impression that even if he were free, he would not run. </p>
<p>His behavior was most curious.</p>
<p>You see, I was a detective. I had been trained to pick up on the littlest things, and there was quite a lot to pick up. For instance, Mr. Grenwald made a very conscious effort not to touch his feet to the floor. In the same vein, he would wince if I ever touched him with my right glove or if he brushed the left arm of his chair. There were a multitude of these little ‘micro-evasions’, as I’d come to call them: and in combination they turned this man into a writhing shape of fear and discomfort.</p>
<p>His first words were these:</p>
<p>“I did not believe that the Austrian police would resort to such savagery in this day and age.”</p>
<p>Those words remain with me still. But in that time I was brash and young, and I responded with all of the usual bravado.</p>
<p>“What could you possibly mean? I bring you up here for tea and a chat and you accuse me of savagery?”</p>
<p>He gestured with his head in his wincing, flitting way: “Not you, not now. Down there.”</p>
<p>“The questioning room?”</p>
<p>“The interrogation room,” he said. With such conviction. Such certainty. “The torture room.”</p>
<p>I didn’t let his knowledge faze me. “Ah, so you have an uncle in the police force. Yes, we have had to resort to some rather uncivilized tactics in recent days—but you cannot be civil with the criminal element. For example, with the type of element that kills children?”</p>
<p>“I did not kill a child,” he said.</p>
<p>“Ah, but you did.”</p>
<p>“A child is but a slice, you understand?”</p>
<p>I didn’t. We were talking about murder, not bratwurst. “No, I don’t take your meaning.”</p>
<p>“A child is just one slice. Time <em>t</em>, a part. Instantaneous. I didn’t kill a child,” he said. “I killed a person.”</p>
<p>I called for two coffees and relished at the sight of this delusional murderer trying and failing to drink with cuffed hands. I do regret that slice of me, now.</p>
<p>“So you admit you killed a person. Case closed, yes?”</p>
<p>“It was in self-defense.”</p>
<p>Interesting. “So little Adolf had a knife to your neck?”</p>
<p>“No, he had a shower-head.”</p>
<p>The clerk came around with a few sandwiches, and Werner winced as if the meat were a hot stove. “Do you have anything vegetarian?”</p>
<p>“Eat your meat or eat nothing.” </p>
<p>The man fell silent, still squirming in his seat.</p>
<p>I resumed my line of questioning. “So tell me, what actual motive could you possibly—”</p>
<p>“I’d like you to touch me.”</p>
<p>I’d been warned of the homosexual epidemic in Braunau, but I never thought I’d come to face it myself. “I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>“I want you to touch me, please, on the cheek.”</p>
<p>I got up from my chair. Oh, I would touch him. I would touch him upon the jaw with four knuckles and all the weight of an ex-soldier. As I moved to strike he gasped, “No, please. Without the glove.”</p>
<p>And then I grew curious. </p>
<p>I removed the leather glove and touched him on the cheek. He had no hair, there. He was barely a man, maybe fifteen years old. God. Children killing children on our streets, how horrid.</p>
<p>His eyes glazed over for a moment and he whispered, “You were born in the capital. Your father named you Reinhardt Hertz but your mother calls you Bärchen.” How did he know all this? What reason would anyone have to spy on—“You were a soldier but you hated killing. However, you enjoyed the violence. And so you became a constable here at this very station.” How? “Your children will be named Werner and Wilhelmina, and you will die in 1917 from the shock of seeing your son go to war.”</p>
<p>“What are you?”</p>
<p>“I see people, Detective.” His eyes flickered, like an addict’s. “I don’t see slices, I see people.”</p>
<p>“And you killed in self defense?”</p>
<p>“I killed in self defense. In the defense of others. I see people, and Adolf Hitler is a bad person. He kills all of us. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t.”</p>
<p>His pupils were fully dilated, two deep dark holes. I wondered what they saw.</p>
<p>“This armchair is an antique, built in 1456. Three years ago, your colleagues beat an innocent man to death on this very floor. And many decades from now, after one Great War too many,” he said, “Adolf Hitler murders twelve million people.”</p>
<p>I had nothing to say. </p>
<p>But the chief had plenty. He said an admitted child-murderer was a simple case, and a decent hanging would secure his post for another year or more. He would have none of this talk of 'people' and 'slices' and 'self-defense'. Preposterous, all of it.</p>
<p>I will never forget Werner Grenwald’s face as he felt the hemp brush against his cheek. I understood then what he was seeing, what he felt before he went. He died a thousand deaths before his final passing—perhaps more.</p>
<p>And I will never forget what he told me before he left. A whisper in my ear:</p>
<p>“Oh, the world seems unjust now, I know,” he said. “But, this is but a slice, time <em>t</em>, a part. I’ve <em>seen</em> the world whole, Detective. I've made it so. And it is nothing to fear.”</p>

<p>I'd cracked the /r/writingprompts code. I'd written thousands of sample Hitler stories, covering every conceivable scenario. I'd racked up over 100,000 comment karma over the last few months just copy-pasting my pre-written Hitler stories every few hours.</p>
<p>You may remember my 2,500-word supernatural action-thriller in response to <em>Hitler is born in America instead</em>. How could something so well-crafted be written in 30 minutes? Sorry to disappoint, but it took over a week of polishing.</p>
<p>Or how about my response to <em>You go back in time and kill Hitler, but something worse takes his place</em>? I did this one as a comedy. Because nothing's worse than Hitler.</p>
<p><em>Hitler goes back in time and kills you</em> - This one was pretty weird but I managed to pull it off anyways, as you're probably aware.</p>
<p>So imagine my surprise when I opened up my browser this morning and there wasn't a <em>single</em> Hitler prompt sitting in "rising" or "new," let alone in "hot." I waited a few hours – still nothing.</p>
<p>I decided to take matters into my own hands. I fired up my alt (/u/NotRPWrites) and posted a killer Hitler prompt. <em>You are literally Hitler. You travel back in time to stop some time travelers who want to kill your parents.</em> I then posted my pre-written story fifteen minutes later and sat back.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the first downvote appeared. Or rather, first two downvotes – one on the post itself, and one on my story. Then a comment: "What the fuck are you talking about?"</p>
<p>I clicked on my own username to see my history. I had negative three hundred and seventy-eight comment karma, which was quite a bit lower than I remembered. I looked back at some of my greatest Hitler stories, and almost all of them had massive downvotes and comment replies that were complete non-sequiturs.</p>
<p>I did a Reddit search for "Hitler" and found nothing except for my comments. <em>How is there nothing on Reddit about Hitler?</em></p>
<p>That wasn't quite true. There was <em>one</em> /r/TodayILearned article about Hitler. I clicked through.</p>
<p><em>TIL an Austrian painter named Adolf Hitler was killed by a futuristic plasma beam.</em></p>
<p>Holy shit. Someone had done it. Someone had actually gone back in time and killed Hitler.</p>
<p><em>...wait. Then how do I know about Hitler?</em></p>

<p>The van ploughed in to the side of my car. There was no pain, just a dull, tingling sensation all over my body as the blood leaked out and I faded in to unconsciousness.</p>
<p>I woke up. I found myself surrounded on all sides by an expanse of inhospitable, fissured rock of a dark red colour. What appeared to be magma could be seen flowing through the cracked geology, the occasional geyser spurting up with a brilliant intensity. The first thing I noticed, aside from my environment, was a figure approaching me from a distance. As he got closer, I saw an immaculate suit, and a face that looked almost human except for the deep, crimson eyes. He began to speak to me in a hoarse, strained voice, though I already knew what he was about to say.</p>
<p>"Welcome. I am the devil, and this is hell."</p>
<p>Though I had realised this already, there is no way to describe the dread that shoots up your spine when you these words are spoken to you. The second thing he said, however, took me by surprise.</p>
<p>"You are its sole occupant, well, except for me I suppose."</p>
<p>It took a few moments for this to sink in before my protest began.</p>
<p>"Really, I'm the only person to be sentenced to hell? What did I do? I never murdered, never raped, never stole. Are you telling me the people who did these things get to go to heaven, and I end up in hell?"</p>
<p>"Let me ask you," the devil began, "are you certain you died? What is the last you remember?"</p>
<p>"I was in a car accident, I lost consciousness, and I ended up here."</p>
<p>"Ah, exactly," responded the devil. "You lost consciousness. You have yet to die. My guess is that the paramedics will be reviving you in a few minutes. You see, the true reality of hell hasn't been expressed in any of the religious texts you humans are so fond of. Hell is an eternal punishment, and there is no crime you can commit on earth which could possibly warrant infinite retribution. Even for the worst of your species, the punishment would not fit the crime. Your presence here is only permitted due to the temporary nature of your death. Eternal punishment is only handed out for heavenly crimes, and I am the only one who has been found deserving. An eternal isolation in a barren, violent land. The only respite I get is when one such as yourself presents me with a brief moment of company. Time does not pass the same here as on earth, and the few minutes until your mortal revival will correspond to a few hours here. So please, do me the courtesy of a conversation. I'm so very lonely."</p>
<p>We sat down on the rocky ground and talked.</p>

<p>Dagon</p>
<p>By Doctor Murderstein</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37F_NnnkUlM&amp;ab_channel=CyaelDobson">Narrated</a> by the talented /u/cyaelsenpai</p>
<p>My father never introduced me to Dagon until shortly before he died. In retrospect, it wasn't that large of a shock to me. The position of ministry of finance had been vacant for ages, and though I never saw him actually doing the work it was a role my father, and his father before him, had claimed to fill. It was a suspicious state of affairs, with only a few trusted and tight-lipped staff being allowed in the lower levels near the treasury, and absolutely no one but the king allowed to proceed to the inner vault. </p>
<p>The 'inner vault' was a small, mostly empty room towards the back of the treasury. It contained all the highest valuables of the Kingdom, mostly irreplaceable and intricate trinkets and gems that didn't actually take up that much room. The first time my father ever let me in the room with him it wasn't to show me any of this, though. In the back of this room filled with all the smallest and most ornate things in the kingdom was a small and beat up crate, the kind one might find in the kitchens. In that crate, was Dagon. It was when I laid eyes on him that father told me he was the most valuable thing to us in all the kingdom; that we and our people had prospered and been well fed and had a well-funded military for centuries because of Dagon's sole efforts.</p>
<p>He was pathetic. The wyrm's skin was gray and splotchy. His wings were shriveled, though functional with some effort, and one of his front legs had never healed right after an encounter with a rat trap, he would tell me later. He lay still, almost lifeless in his crate on a pile of gold and silver coins, some of which had obviously made up his bedding since the time of my great-great grandfather. Upon stirring I learned one of his eyes was milky white, but despite all appearances his voice was as strong as any man's and he spoke with the eloquence of an era gone by. He and my father spoke like old friends, and meeting me seemed to distress Dagon somewhat as he knew it meant my father's time was short.</p>
<p>He loved my father, fanatically so. At the end of the night when introductions had been made, and once I'd been briefed by my father and Dagon both, my father had sent me away to talk to Dagon alone. I'd turned as I left the vault, and watched as Dagon had flown to my father's shoulder, where he was well-received. From his spot on my father's shoulder the tiny dragon gripped my father's lapels, and leaned his head against my father's.</p>
<p>"Oh, Majesty," the little dragon had said, and as if to say it was alright my father had reached up and comforted Dagon the way one might a cat.</p>
<p>"It's the way of things, Dagon," the old king had told him. He took a few coins from his pocket and put them in the crate. "These are the last coins struck under my reign. The last ones with my face on them. I'll be gone soon, and wanted you to have these." </p>
<p>A few nights later, when my father had passed, I found Dagon uneasily rearranging his coins. A quirk of his dragon nature wouldn't let him sleep and he was up most of the night restlessly rearranging them, shifting uneasily from coins my father looked young on and the ones he'd given him most recently. </p>
<p>This was all years ago. Just as he had for my father before me Dagon proved to be the most wise and trustworthy council. I'd consulted him in times of war and famine, and he'd taken care of my kingdom. There were nights Dagon was sick and I'd stay in the inner vault all night, letting him sleep in my bejeweled crown, turned upside down on a table and filled with his favorite coins, which seemed to reinvigorate him. Sometimes he would leave the vault and join me, hiding in the folds of robes to whisper secrets in my ear when his wisdom and counsel was needed outside the vault. </p>
<p>Tonight I'm heading to see Dagon like I have so many times before. I walked the route I'd taken countless times like my fathers had, through halls and doorways that had seen countless kings come and go. It took me longer than it used to, and some of the doors seemed to only grow heavier over the years. I passed the guards of the treasury, members of my own personal security detail who could be trusted not to harm Dagon even if they did discover him. Telling them I might be a while I closed the door of the outer vault behind me and proceeded towards the interior. When I had closed the interior vault door Dagon stirred in his crate, and his head rose on his long neck to see above the brim.</p>
<p>"Dagon", I said to him as I placed an aged hand on the young man next to me. "This is my son." </p>
<p>The small dragon trembled terribly. "Oh, Majesty", was his only reply.</p>

<p>She’s so beautiful. </p>
<p>The second I see her my mind darts back to that little dinner party anecdote my uncle would always spout. “Well I had to travel to France,” he’d start “when your <em>words</em> are in French, you have to take the plunge. Six months I studied the language, six months I saved money for a ticket, only to find my belle chou was a stewardess on the flight!” I hate that story. He always smiled and winked at me after telling it, never knowing how much it hurt me. How was he to know, I’d never told him. I have no <em>words</em>. </p>
<p>Christ, now shes smiling at me. </p>
<p>My stomach lurches as I pretend to look past her, knowing I can’t put off going to her forever. Theres nothing like spending your life knowing youre destined to be alone. I’ve learned to avoid conversations when <em>words</em> come up; I feign insult and cite taboo if anyone asks directly about mine. I’ve had flings; girls have seen my unetched skin, but even when they mask their shock and dissapointment, their pity still shines through. I’ve learned to live with it. I’ve also learned they never call back afterwards.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t get paid for standing around moping my own misfortune. I take a deep breath and start to walk over to her table, trying and failing to look anywhere but her stunning face. I feel the colour rise in my cheeks at the same rate my stomach is sinking. Am I sweating? God I must look like an idiot to her. I clear my throat. “Good morning maam, how can I help? Coffee?” She pulls a cute appologetic face while raising her fist to her chest and moving it in a circle. I am confused. This is confusing, right? She points to her ear before theatrically shrugging her shoulders and shaking her head. I don’t see which beverage she’s pointing to on the menu, instead I just grin as I realise what’s happening. She has no words either.  </p>

<p>"Yes, Belle, you are."</p>
<p>I shook my head. "I'm just a regular girl, confused and a bit dissatisfied with the world I live in, like every girl my age. I got this slight feeling that I'm special, sure, but so does every other teenager. Really, I'm normal as they come."</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>"I mean, I'd wear Morrissey shirts, if The Smiths existed in our fictional world."</p>
<p>Gary nodded again. "Yes. You are normal and bland. Boring, even. A perfect blank slate. Something every single reader can identify with and think <em>'I am special, for I am just like the special protagonist'</em>."</p>
<p>"But if everyone thinks they are special, doesn't that defeat the very purp –"</p>
<p>"Just go with it, Belle. Don't question these things."</p>
<p>I sighed, tired. "Fine. What do I have to do?"</p>
<p>"Something absolutely awful and horrendous that no humane society would ever in a million years make people do just for the sake of adventure. It's going to be a death match with other teenagers."</p>
<p>"Fuck. Really?"</p>
<p>"Don't say fuck. Can't say fuck in a YA."</p>
<p>"Sorry. Crap. Really?"</p>
<p>"Hey, it was either this or going through the Triwizard Tournament just for the sake of you touching a trophy that's going to transport you to a cemetery, when the person who turned the trophy into a portkey could just as well have 
turned any other object around you to a portkey during the whole school year at Hogwarts and saved about 500 pages of what's arguably the weakest installment of the Potter series."</p>
<p>"You know, there's not one part of this sentence I don't need explained."</p>
<p>"Just forget it. Go get ready for the death match."</p>
<p>I nodded. It's silly, I know, but all of a sudden, I was worried. "Gary… Wait…"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"What if I die?"</p>
<p>And Gary rolled his eyes at me. "You're not going to die, Belle. You're the main character."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's going to look like you are gonna die, a bunch of times. You might even actually die, but then you'll do 
some voodoo crap and just go back to life with no good explanation at all. Man, I'm angry at Rowling today."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Relax. You're not going to die. If anything, you'll probably even live longer in the movies, since they're likely to do two films out of the last book no matter how unnecessary that sounds."</p>
<p>Gary, he had a way of calming me with his soft, confident tone and his reassuring smile. Even when he talked nonsense, like he was now. Again, I nodded. "Thanks, Gary."</p>
<p>"Now go get ready to do stuff that has been done better a thousand times before  so we can take money off of 
gullible people."</p>
<p>We hugged, and I turned back to leave. Suddenly, though, a thought crossed my mind.</p>
<p>"Hey, Gary…" I said, turning back to him.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"You know how I date Mike, and he's all strong and tanned and nice to me?"</p>
<p>"Yeah…"</p>
<p>"And how you are thin and pale, but cute in a rebel kind of way, and you treat me like shit in a charming manner?"</p>
<p>"Sure…"</p>
<p>I took another step towards him, feeling my cheeks blush. "Well... what if we start having feelings for each other? And weird PG-13 sexual tension moments between us? And then maybe Mike finds out, and stuff even gets a bit homoerotic between the two of you? What if all that happens?"</p>
<p>Gary took a deep breath. He rubbed his eyes with his hand, then pulled long, blonde locks of hair away from his 
face. His emerald blue eyes pierced me like a bad metaphor.</p>
<p>"Damn. Robert Pattinson is playing me in the movie, isn't he?" He asked, in a tired voice.</p>
<p>"Probably", I answered.</p>
<p>And then we made out and subtextually fucked like rabbits.</p>

"It's a surprise," he answers. "But..." he gets a mischievous grin, "I can promise that it will be a very memorable evening!" He reaches around the candles on the table and softly takes my hand. "And I can't wait to see your reaction."</p>
<p>From within my purse, my communicator rings. I grind my teeth as he looks at me with a puzzled expression. </p>
<p>"Sorry," I whisper, fumbling through the giant messy pile in my bag looking for the communicator. "Just my phone, sorry. I'll turn it off..." I finally wrap my fingers around the little round device and pretend to look at the caller ID of my 'phone.' </p>
<p>"Oh, this is actually important," I tell him. "Please, give me a moment?" </p>
<p>He nods, but I can still see the subtle glance at his watch as I scamper around the corner to the bathroom. It's the mayor, of course. Part of me hesitates: do I <em>really</em> want to answer this? I'm two glasses of wine in already, and it can't be <em>that</em> urgent if my super-hearing isn't picking up any sirens...

<p>"I..." my mind desperately searches for some other way around the problem. Part of me wants to just tell the mayor that electricity really isn't that important.</p>

<p>"Please," I cut him off. "It's an emergency at work. And I swear it will only take me a half hour. Maybe less!" <em>How hard could it be to get rid of a few bombs?</em> Before he can even answer, I signal to the waiter. "Get this man the best dessert you've got, and a glass of your finest scotch." </p>
<p>Isaac finally smiles and relents. "I'm leaving in half an hour, though," he tells me. </p>
<p>I lean down and kiss him deeply on the lips. "No, you'll wait," I tease him. "It'll be worth it."</p>
<p>His normally quick mind can't think of a response, and I hustle out the door before he distracts me again.</p>
<hr />
<p>True to my word, I am back in half an hour. The mayor's men had already found most of the bombs, so it was simply a matter of collecting them all and carrying them out to sea where they can safely detonate. Disarming them would take too long anyway. Luckily I can fly pretty quickly.</p>
<p>"Well, well," he says with a haughty grin. "Looks who's back."</p>
<p>I give him another kiss and pull him from the chair. "Come on," I tell him. "I'm ready for the rest of the date!" </p>
<p>He walks me out to the car, where the driver is waiting. Always the perfect gentleman, he holds the door for me and offers me a hand for balance. Good thing, too: I'm not really used to high heels. </p>
<p>"One last thing," he tells me as the car accelerates down the street. "This last part is a bit of a surprise, so you're going to need to put this on over your eyes." He holds out a black scarf of some kind. I laugh, not sure if he's serious, but he is. He doesn't really know that I can see through it, or that my hearing is acute enough to use echolocation, but it's a very nice gesture nonetheless.</p>
<p>After a short ride, we arrive at our destination: The Mt. Portage Observatory tower. </p>
<p>"Can I take off the blindfold yet?" I ask, playing my part perfectly.</p>
<p>He checks his watch again and frowns. "Um, not yet," he says. He removes his phone from his pocket and pecks at it furiously with his finger, brow furrowed in frustration. "Just another minute or so," he says. He pokes at it again and again, and nothing happens. </p>
<p>"All right," he says, untying it for me. </p>
<p>I gasp in 'surprise' at the beautiful view, but my smile is certainly genuine. </p>
<p>"There's supposed to be a meteor shower," he says, gesturing at the picnic and chilled bottle of champagne that he has had laid out for us.

<p>"All right. Take care."</p>
<p>And then they were gone.</p>
<p>Harry closed the front door and made way down the corridor, past the living room into his bedroom.</p>
<p>He sighed, staring blankly at the king size bed much too big for him in between the nightstands.</p>
<p>Slowly, he made way to the closet and opened the door. He took the mustard-stained, ripped yellow shirt he used 
to sleep in so many years before from the top drawer and looked at it.</p>
<p>He unbuttoned the shirt he was wearing and took it off, laying it carefully on the bed. With a sigh, he put the yellow shirt on.</p>
<p>A second later, the bedroom door opened, like it had five years in a row now, every last day of October.</p>
<p>"Hey there", Lisa said, with the same smile she used every time.</p>
<p>Harry smiled, too. "Hey."</p>
<p>Lisa made way to him and took his hand. "I can't believe I let you sleep next to me in that old, stinky thing", she said, looking down at his shirt.</p>
<p>Harry chuckled. "It's my Lisa's Boyfriend costume", he said. "You know that."</p>
<p>"And it's the cheapest costume anyone ever wore on Halloween. It's just a shirt."</p>
<p>"It's the shirt I used to sleep in, before you..." Harry said, choking on the words before he could finish the sentence.</p>
<p>Lisa ran her hand down his cheek, wiping the tears. "It's ok, Harry."</p>
<p>"No it's not", Harry said, now between sobs. "Of course it's not. You're dead."</p>
<p>"Not tonight, I'm not", Lisa replied, pulling him closer. "Tonight I'm here."</p>
<p>Harry tried for a smile, but failed. For a while, neither of them said anything.</p>
<p>"I missed yo –"</p>
<p>"Shh", Lisa interrupted, placing her finger carefully on his lips. "Miss me tomorrow."</p>
<p>Harry lowered his eyes and his forehead touched Lisa's. Somewhere out the window, someone yelled, <em>"I'm flying! I 
loved this motherfucking Peter Pan outfit!</em>"</p>
<p>"I loved you so much, Lisa", Harry sobbed, quietly. "So much."</p>
<p>And Harry felt Lisa's hand run down his hair, and felt her breath on his neck and he thought that, eventually, he'd 
have to decide if he either hated or loved Halloween. It was a tough call.</p>

<h1>[WP] As humanity sends its first manned expedition beyond the orbit of earth, it discovers that humans are actually immortal, but "Mother Earth" is actually a living organism that has been consuming their life force to survive.</h1>
<p>Score: 1752</p>
<p>Earth was never meant to live this long. </p>
<p>She was supposed to die with her sister, Mars, years ago. She's been sick, plagued by ice age chills, fever swings, and marks on her complexion. </p>
<p>But I knew Earth when she was beautiful, and now that she's not, I still remember. </p>
<p>It's a shame I can only see her every seventy years. But that's the rules of the cosmos, as the mathamatical gears of the universes laws bring us together and sperate again. Our relationshio was long distance, but each time I returned, she looked worse, more tiresome, more feeble. </p>
<p>"Earth," I cried, swinging by her in an arcing hug, "Earth, you cannot leave me now.  You cannot leave me alone, to travel in this solar system for seventy years, and have only sadness when I finally reach you."</p>
<p>"Halley, my comet, my love." Said Earth in my embrace, "I fear I am near my end. I have waited this long to see you, and I do not know if I can wait again."</p>
<p>"No," I cried, "Surely there is a way. A way for me to spend the rest your days with you."</p>
<p>Earth was silent, then she said, "There is one way. I will fill a creature with my spirit, but my spirit will sleep until you arrive. Seventy years alseep, and one awake, and I will spend all those ones with you."</p>
<p>So Earth poured her spirit into a new being she named man, and every seventy years, as I flew back, she awoke. Now millions of eyes watch me pass, and I see her in every one of them. But though she ages slower, death still comes for her. It comes as her spirit slowly falters in men, and they forget her, and she departs their bodies an minds, and they too will fall to waste. </p>
<p>But until that time will pass, I get to see her every seventy years. She sees me every one of her waking days. </p>
<p>I now leave a sparkling tail, as tears fall behind me, because I fear her last day is soon.  </p>
<p>And even though she has so little left, men depart her with the remaining bits of her spirit, stealing it from me, traveling where I shall never see her again. </p>
