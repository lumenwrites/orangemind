<h1>[WP] After dying, you're shown a "Choose Your Own Adventure" style decision tree which highlights all the paths your life could have taken should you have made various different choices. You spend all of eternity analyzing this tree, only to finally realize that something just isn't quite right.</h1>
<p>Score: 2618</p>
<p>EDIT: THERE IS NOW AN OFFICIAL SUBREDDIT TO DISCUSS THIS POST AND ITS EXPANSION INTO A FULLY FLEDGED NOVEL. /r/MattsWrittenWord IF YOU WISH TO BE KEPT UP TO DATE WITH THIS STORIES PRODUCTION PLEASE ENTER IT. </p>
<p>"Okay, that never happened in the first place, " I stated simply to the reaper invigilator. "Something is wrong in your base files because after a millenium of analysis and searching my memories I can tell you... that one never happened."</p>
<p>The reaper floated closer to me, it's black trench coat flapping slightly in the non existent breeze of my eternity-vault. I felt sorry for the reapers at times like this, I'd always been stubborn and it probably didn't deserve it. They were born at the same time as our souls were and tethered to us for the rest of eternity. They didn't want it, they didn't need it and the contract was ultimately binding. It was a good thing that my reaper and I got on, otherwise eternity would have been all kinds of messed up. </p>
<p>"It's probably part of an offshoot then, wouldn't be the first time time you've made that mistake," the reaper snarked, drifting over to my record banks. </p>
<p>"Not an offshoot, up top got really pissy last time I made that mistake, never again," I muttered shaking my head. "Look, right there, that kiss. I have full access to all my memories in here and I can tell you that one did not happen." </p>
<p>I would have liked it to though, that much both me and the reaper knew.  I'd studied the offshoot that one had spawned many times before. Love, fortune, joy and a distinctive lack of the money owed that lead to me... dying. It would have been a nice and long life, one of the happiest offshoots there had been. But it wasn't real, that much I knew.  </p>
<p>"You're right..." The reaper clarified, "that's new... that wasn't there the last time we scanned that segment... so how is it there now..."</p>
<p>We both floated in silence for a moment, staring at the erroneous piece of time line.  Nothing like this had happened to us before and the reaper had never heard of it happening to any of the other deads either. It was a perplexing quandary to say the least.</p>
<p>"I'm contacting head office now, keep an eye on your time line,  anything else changes you let me know straight away okay?" The reaper ordered before drawing the outline of a phone, the item materialising near instantly. Damn reapers and their matter manipulation talents, I wish I had matter manipulation abilities, all sorts of fun things could happen then.</p>
<p>I turned my eyes back to the time line,  tracing along from the new change. A heavy lump formed in my throat. The whole thing was twisting and cracking and splintering out of control. Offshoots replacing reality then melding the two together in a strange abomination of the two. </p>
<p>"Reap, my time line is going out of control, get someone in here right now," I ordered. He didnt reply but from the crack of energy behind me I knew the head honcho had showed up.</p>
<p>He wasn't God, he hadn't created humanity, rather the opposite. He was one of the first reapers and had been the one to sort out the department of reaping along with his Human. If it weren't for them our time lines would have been lost to the winds of time, and then what would we have spent eternity doing? </p>
<p>"This better not be another mistake Daniels," the head said, amusement tinting his tone. "By the gods..." he muttered as he drew closer and saw what was happening. </p>
<p>"Is it localised to him?" My Reaper asked and the head nodded in response. </p>
<p>"Someone from the living world is tampering with his time line,  they're trying to find an eventuality where he becomes immortal," the head explained,  his eyes flicking over the twisting lines. </p>
<p>"We never discovered anything like that during our analysis, and we've been here for over a millenia," I said, my voice incredulous. There was no way there was such a time line, and even if there was who would want me to live forever that badly?</p>
<p>"My Human and I have been in this realm for many more thousands of years Daniels, I can assure you that you haven't seen every possibility yet."</p>
<h2>The world began to flicker in and out of my vision. I vaguely heard the head swear and my own reaper gasp in pain. They must have found it.  The one where I lived forever. For the first time since death I felt a little flutter of excitement. I was going back to the world of the living... I wonder if I will remember any of this.</h2>
<h1>[WP] You just got fired, you're pretty sure your girlfriend is cheating on you, you're 75k in student loans debt, rent was due last week, and to top it all off? You're all out of beer. Oddly enough, you just got an email titled "Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard."</h1>
<p>Score: 2477</p>
<p>I broke my fixation on the woefully empty bottle of beer to glance down at my phone as it <em>dinged</em>, notifying me about an email. I sighed. Debt collectors and spam. That's all I ever got anymore. At least the latter allowed me the pleasure of pressing the fun little trashcan icon. </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change...</strong>, the preview of the subject read. Hell, yeah. I would give anything to change everything right now. My girlfriend was gone on some escapade with her not-so-secret lover, my student loan debt was three times what I made in a year, pre-taxes, the eviction notice was still taped to the door... I hadn't been too broke to buy beer since college, but here I was. Same old.</p>
<p>I swiped right and typed in the double 69 password; a relic from more cheerful times. The email was short and to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very hard.</strong> Seemed about as legit as the Nigerian prince my grandpa was always helping out. My finger hovered over the trashcan icon but my phone <em>dinged</em> again, the echo bouncing off the walls of the nearly empty room. A text this time with the same message and a simple instruction: <strong>Reply YES for details</strong>. I shrugged and typed the message, arching my eyebrows skeptically as the message <em>whooshed</em> away and I turned back to the bottle hoping to leach out a couple more drops.</p>
<p><strong>Pick your level: First World Problems, Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard</strong>. I sighed. Whoever this was, they were persistent. A cruel joke, most likely. Getting my hopes up that my life could be anything more than a miserable shit hole. I chose the first option and hit send, shrugging in mild irritation before sighing and heading to my bed. Without the electric bills paid and nothing to entertain me, I was sleeping by dusk, my schedule more Amish than an Ohioan's. My phone rang a moment later, just as I was settling in and starting to tell myself a bedtime story.</p>
<p>"Mom?" I said hesitantly, surprised that she would call after six months of not talking to me. She let out a muffled sob and I sat up in my bed. "What happened?"</p>
<p>"It's dad..." she stuttered as she struggled to catch her breath. I frowned. My dad had been getting cigarettes since '95 and if he was suddenly showing up now, I wanted nothing to do with him. "Your grandfather passed away," she said quietly and I scowled. Disrupting my 8 o'clock bedtime for this? The man was a grade A dumbass and had provided more for random hookers than he had for me.</p>
<p>"I... I'm sorry," I managed to say half-heartedly.</p>
<p>"You barely knew him," she answered softly. "I can't see what he saw, but he must have thought very highly of you. He left you his fortune and the house by the lake. You're rich..." she said mournfully and I quietly gulped as I tried to fathom the idea.</p>
<p>"Goddammit," I sighed knocking my head against the headboard of the bed. "I'm gonna have a shit ton of taxes to do."</p>

<p>Jack looked back in his rearview to see Mike yawn audibly from the backseat, tapping absently on a bottle of root beer as they crawled on the interstate.</p>
<p>"Can't you go any slower?" Mike said. Jack couldn't help but concede that Mike had the right to complain- he'd confiscated all the booze and insisted on driving, after all. </p>
<p>Jack ignored him and drove on in silence. He was way under the speed limit, but the last thing he wanted was for a creature or person to dash in front of their headlights, starting a night of misadventure to hide the dead body.</p>
<p>Jennifer, sitting on the passenger side, frowned. Her peroxide blonde hair wafted in the wind.</p>
<p>"Oh, no! There's no network." </p>
<p>Mike scoffed. "Who cares, Jenn? We're on a camping trip. The point is to get away from civilization for a little while."</p>
<p>"No worries, I bought a satellite phone with extra batteries for this trip," Jack brought out a Nokia from his pocket.</p>
<p>Mike rolled his eyes. Then his eyes widened.</p>
<p>"Would you look at that?"</p>
<p>"Woah!" Jenn exclaimed as she looked at a small dirt road that forked off the asphalt. It was blocked by a rusty old gate that carried an ominous warning for trespassers.</p>
<p>"That padlock," Mike said, "is older than my grandpa. I bet we can break in. The view looks gorgeous too- what the fuck?"</p>
<p>Jack swiveled the car and floored it till the gate was out of sight. Then he slowed back down to under the speed limit.</p>
<p>"Ain't no way we're going in there. Go alone if you want to."</p>
<p>"You're such a killjoy, Jack," Jennifer said.</p>
<p>Killjoy- Jack smiled at her choice of words. <em>I can be as joyless as needed</em>, he thought, <em>as long as I'm not killed</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The tents were up and the campfire rustled. It was a small clearing in a state park that the Parks and Wildlife Department had certified safe for campers. Jack had scoured the internet to double check. He didn't find any creepy legends or strange sightings in any of the forums.</p>
<p>Jack lay down in his tent and checked the batteries on his flashlight.</p>
<p>"Hey, Jack. " Jennifer snuck inside the tent coyly. She gave a flirtatious half-smile as she lay down next to him. </p>
<p>"Oh hell no!"</p>
<p>Jennifer sprang back, she wasn't used to this reaction.</p>
<p>Jack had seen too many movies. Sex was practically the harbinger for a gruesome death. There was no way he was having sex in a forest on a dark, moonless night with a pack of coyotes wailing in the distance.</p>
<p>He looked at her glassy eyes still recovering from the rejection. Feeling bad for her, he lied.</p>
<p>"It's not you, Jenn. It's me. I'm gay."</p>
<p>""What? But what about Stacie-"</p>
<p>"I just realized this morning. Don't tell Mike, or anyone else for that matter. Please?"</p>
<p>She took her clothes and left.</p>
<hr />
<p>Despite all precautions and traps set by Jack around their tents, something had attacked their camp and they were on the run. They panted as they stopped upon a bifurcation in the hiker's trail.</p>
<p>"We should split up," Mike said.</p>
<p>Jennifer nodded in agreement. Jack looked at them in amazement.</p>
<p>"Are you fucking kidding me?"</p>
<p>"What? It will be easier. We split up, find some help, then come back in this exact same spot and we're all safe."</p>
<p>"El fucking oh el."</p>
<p>"Jack, look. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I need you to show some teamwork here."</p>
<p>"Over my dead body. I'm gonna follow you guys and I'll be in the middle. Mike, you lead. Jenn, you follow."</p>
<p>Mike and Jenn sighed, but finally agreed with Jack as they heard their pursuers closing in.</p>
<hr />
<p>Twigs snapped and branches slapped on their faces as the three of them ran. It had been a good decision to let Mike take the lead. The monster- or whatever it was attacking them, had come from the front.</p>
<p>Mike, who'd already been stumbling, finally fell down.</p>
<p>"Shit!" He screamed in pain.</p>
<p>Jack and Jennifer looked back at Mike, hunched on the ground, clutching his ankle in agony.</p>
<p>"You two go ahead- I'll be fine," he said, waving his hands, taking his voice an octave higher, trying hard to sound heroic.</p>
<p>"Good idea," Jack said as he turned to run.</p>
<p>"Hey! I was kidding, obviously. Help out, dude. You've gotta carry me."</p>
<p>"Did that thing bite you?"</p>
<p>"Did it what?"</p>
<p>"Did it bite you?"</p>
<p>Mike didn't reply. His hand subconsciously grazed over his shoulders, where, Jack noticed, there was a deep gash.</p>
<p>"Fuck you, I'm outta here."</p>
<p>Jennifer looked at Jack running through the thickets. Then back at Mike, who was now lying on the ground like easy prey. She said a quick sorry and ran in Jack's direction.</p>
<hr />
<p>The monsters had cornered them. </p>
<p>Jack cowered behind a fallen log. Jenn started making nervous noises. She was having a panic attack.</p>
<p>He thought of putting a hand to her mouth and trying to soothe her out of it. But he could hear the footsteps of the creatures coming closer and closer.</p>
<p>Nice guys finish last, Jack. He reminded himself. With a quick hit under the nose he knocked her unconscious.</p>
<hr />
<p>They seemed to be safe for the moment. They had lost the monsters. Jack's shoulders were aching from carrying an unconscious Jenn. </p>
<p>"Where are we?" She asked, there was a drowsiness in her voice suggesting that she was still not out of it.</p>
<p>They entered an area of low growth and in front of them was a small cabin.</p>
<p>"Oh look, a cabin in the woods. We're saved!"</p>
<p>Jack could see a confederate flag hanging from one of the windows. On the yard two holes had been dug out. Six feet under, human-sized.</p>
<p>"Hey! We need help!" Jenn called out.</p>
<p>Jack put her down. He could hear highway sounds not far away.</p>
<p>"You seem to have regained consciousness. Good luck with the creepy cabin dude, I'm out of it."</p>
<p>And with that Jack ran in the direction of the highway, noping the fuck out of a sleepover at the creepy cabin.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jack was glad to have reached civilization as he waved at the passing cars.</p>
<p>A station wagon with "Free Candy" scribbled with key scratches on the rusted hull stopped by him.</p>
<p>"Need a ride?"</p>
<p>"No thanks." Jack said, and started moving along the road.</p>
<p>The man looked disappointed but drove away.</p>
<p>After waiting a bit, Jack saw a squad car approach.</p>
<p>He couldn't control his joy. He had escaped the ordeal. He had survived in a horror movie setting despite being black. This was a story he was going to tell his grandchildren. He jumped and waved frantically at his uniformed saviors.</p>
<p>The cops got out and screamed into the radio.</p>
<p>"We found the suspect! Suspicious black male, blood splatters on his t-shirt."</p>
<p>"Down on the ground!" The other cop shouted.</p>
<p>"No, no, you've got it wrong." Jack tried to calm them down, his palms up front, facing them.</p>
<p>"Suspect acting hostile, I repeat suspect acting hostile..."</p>
<p><em>Bang! Bang!</em> The other cop emptied his cartridges and Jack lay on the street, blood pooling on the asphalt in an ever-enlarging puddle.</p>

<h1>[CW] Write a gruesome story using only euphemisms so than it can be read to a group of children without frightening them</h1>
<p>Score: 2187</p>
<p>George worked all day long putting animals to sleep. Helping animals go to sleep was his job. He put all different kinds of dogs to sleep, and all kinds of cats, and once he even put a lizard to sleep. For some reason putting all these animals to sleep -- sometimes even fifty or sixty animals in one day! -- made George very tired and worn out, as if instead of putting animals to sleep he'd spent the day carrying bags of sand up a steep hill.</p>
<p>Sometimes, late at night, George dreamed about the animals. In his dreams the dogs and cats and lizard were awake, with happy looks on their dog and cat and lizard faces. The dogs had big pink tongues that drooped out. The cats purred and licked their fur. The lizard kind of just sat there. When they saw George, though, the animals acted very scared. The dogs put their tails between their legs and backed away with sad eyes. The cats hissed and climbed into trees. The lizard continued to kind of just sit there, although it looked a little bit alarmed.  </p>
<p>"Please," said George, "I don't want to hurt you."  </p>
<p>But the animals never let him anywhere near them.  </p>
<p>When George was working, he tried to think about other things. He thought about his friends. George was sixty-eight years old, and many of his friends had passed away, but he still remembered many excellent things about them. One of his friends, Michael, whose skin was the creamy color of milk chocolate, had a habit of flipping the bird at police officers. This was always good for a laugh, until one day a policeman took offense to the bird-flipping and introduced Michael to the business end of his nightstick. Michael was sent to a correctional facility. He kicked the bucket shortly thereafter.  </p>
<p>George estimated that he'd put something like ten thousand animals to sleep in his lifetime. This number, which increased every day, weighed very heavily on his shoulders. It got to a point where he couldn't go five minutes without thinking about buying the farm. If he bought the farm, he could see his parents again, and he'd never have to put any more animals to sleep. He began to read articles on the Internet about the easiest way to buy the farm. One article said the easiest way was to sit in your car in your garage, but George didn't have a garage, or even a car. Another article said you could use your Second Amendment rights to buy the farm, but George's various run-ins with the law as a youth prevented him from passing a background check.  </p>
<p>In the end, George opted for the method of buying the farm that seemed quickest and most simple: he climbed up to the top of a very tall skyscraper, said a prayer, and flew away.  </p>
<p>After that, the animals he'd put to sleep weren't afraid to let him touch them any more. The dogs jumped on him and licked his face. The cats pressed themselves against his legs.  </p>
<p>Even the lizard let him rub it on the back of its head.  </p>

<p>"You mean you really never realized? I'm wearing the Archmage's Robes <em>right now</em>!"</p>
<p>"Well, I just... I don't know, I thought the outfit was one of those cheap replicas you can buy at the tourist's shops in Imperial City."</p>
<p>"But they're <em>glowing</em> and <em>shimmering</em>. Clearly magical. And also they still have that old man smell from the last Archmage."</p>
<p>"I just... I guess I never noticed that."</p>
<p>"Ok... well, what about the Grey Cowl? I mean, it belonged to Nocturnal herself! There's no way that could be a fake."</p>
<p>"Well I didn't <em>know</em> what it was. I mean, I've seen people from Bruma before, so I figured you were just ugly and wanted a mask to hide your face or something."</p>
<p>"No, it's the real deal. And I'd also watch those snide little insults, given that I'm Guildmaster in the Fighting Guild."</p>

<p>"Errr... well, yeah, kind of. We were pretty tight. See, me and his dad - You know, Emperor Urial Septim? - we escaped through the Imperial City's sewers this one time, and..."</p>
<p>"I was being sarcastic! You seriously knew both of them? By the Nine, how <em>old</em> are you? I mean, doesn't someone have to work for like an entire lifetime of study and practice to become Archmage?"</p>
<p>"No, no. It took me.... I dunno, like a day or so? You know, now that I think about it, it took just about as long as it took me to become the Listener here in the Dark Fraternity."</p>
<p>"Dark <em>Brotherhood</em>."</p>
<p>"Right, right. Sorry."</p>
<p>"I seriously can't believe this. My own father spent his entire life mastering <em>just illusion magic</em>, and you're telling me that you became Archmage in a <em>day</em>? <em>HOW</em>?"</p>
<p>"It was pretty easy, actually. The last Archmage vanished into a soul gem or something. I don't remember; I wasn't paying attention. Let's see... I ran a bunch of errands, and then they had me kill some King of Worms guy... you know, the funny part was that I never even used magic on him! It just took a few hits from the good old battleaxe, and boom! They promoted me."</p>
<p>"You've got to be kidding me. I kill people all the time! That's all you had to do?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I can barely even do a lightning spell. Kind of messed up, huh? I bet there are a ton of mages back there who really wanted that job. Really sucks for them."</p>
<p>"Wow. This is just... wow. So you are <em>simultaneously</em> the Listener, the Archmage, the Guildmaster, and the Hero of Kvatch!? That's just... damn."</p>
<p>"Yeah. It's been a pretty busy month."</p>
<p>"I just... man, we've got to line up with a fight between you and the Grand Champion of the Arena! He's killed, like, <em>everyone</em> that they send at him. He's probably the only person in Cyrodiil that'll give you a run for your money."</p>

<p>I sat on a park bench, eating my lunch.  I watched as a little girl rolled by on a shiny metal scooter, watching me out of the corner of her eyes.  She zipped around and passed me again.<br />
"Hello," I said.<br />
She stopped, her eyes wide.<br />
"I like your scooter."<br />
She looked down at the scooter, her ponytail flopping in her face, then beamed at me. "It's my trusty steed, Sparklehorn!"  She pointed to a pink sticker of a unicorn.  "He's a unicorn."<br />
"Oh, I see." I smiled. "I've never met a unicorn before."<br />
The girl frowned and pointed at me. "You're the time trampler."<br />
"Time <em>traveller.</em>"<br />
She shrugged.  "My mommy says I can't talk to you. She says you are dangerous."<br />
"Ok." I ate a bite of my sandwich. "What does your daddy say?"<br />
The girl twirled her hair with a finger and scrunched up her face. "He says you're a <em>commie bastard</em>."<br />
"Oh."<br />
The girl furrowed her eyebrows. "What's a 'bastard'?"<br />
I chuckled. "Go ask your daddy."<br />
The girl laid her scooter down on the sidewalk.  "Wanna see me do a cartwheel?"<br />
"Sure."<br />
I finished my lunch as the girl cavorted around me on the sidewalk.  I opened a small bag of cookies while she practiced handstands.  Upside down, she heard the crinkle of the cookie bag and turned her head towards me.<br />
"Are those cookies?"  She dropped her feet and stood up. "I only like chocolate chip cookies."  She paused and tried to look nonchalant. "Do your cookies have any chocolate chips, maybe?"<br />
"They do indeed."  I showed her the bag. "Would you like one?"<br />
"Yes!" she squealed.<br />
I held out a cookie and she snatched it gleefully.<br />
"Do they have chocolate where you are from?" she asked, spraying crumbs onto the sidewalk.    <br />
"I'm from here, sweetie."<br />
"Noooo," she whined, "do they have chocolate <em>in the future</em>?"<br />
I shrugged. "I'm not from the future, I was born in this time.  And I only go backwards in time, not forwards." I paused. "I think."<br />
The girl thought about this for a moment.  "My daddy says you killed people. Is that true?"<br />
I nodded. "That's what all the history books say, so... I guess so?"<br />
"Why?"<br />
"I don't know. I haven't done it yet."<br />
A woman turned the corner on the sidewalk, pushing a stroller.  "Lydia," she called.<br />
"Uh oh," I said.<br />
The little girl's eyes widened and she shoved the rest of her cookie in her mouth and wiped chocolate off her face.  "Thank you," she said through a mouthful of cookie.  She scooped up her scooter and hurried back to her mother.<br />
Her mother scowled in recognition at me and pulled Lydia away down the sidewalk.  I sighed and began cleaning up my lunch.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
"It must be hard for you," said a voice, behind me.  <br />
I turned to see an old man with a cane approaching my bench.  He gestured with his cane to the space beside me.<br />
"May I sit?"<br />
I nodded and tossed my lunch trash into a garbage can next to the bench.<br />
"I'm sorry that everyone treats you poorly," the man said. "You walk a hard enough road already."<br />
"I guess."  I shrugged. "It's weird knowing all these things that I will do.  Like seeing my whole life ahead of me."<br />
"Not your whole life," said the man. "Just the parts that history remembers." The man fiddled with his cane. "History rarely tells the whole story, in my experience."<br />
"I wish I knew why I did, or will do, those things." I hold up my empty hands and examine my palms. "I'm going to stab some poor painter to death in Vienna in 1906? Why would I do that? I've never hurt anyone in my life."<br />
The old man nodded. "Sometimes, we have to make a choice between saving a few or saving many. Maybe it was for the greater good."<br />
"But what about Dallas in 1963? Everyone knows that I was there." I shook my head. "Why don't I save the President? Why didn't I stop Oswald? I did nothing! Why was I even there?"<br />
"Don't be too hard on yourself." The old man clapped a hand on my shoulder. "Especially for something you haven't done yet."<br />
"Some people think that I was the one who pulled the trigger," I mumbled. "I get so many emails about grassy knolls."<br />
"Maybe you were," said the old man. "Maybe you weren't. Maybe you were supposed to save the President but you simply failed." The old man smiled at me. "You're only human, you know, even if you do travel through time."<br />
"I wish that I could just get on with it," I said. "Ever since the discovery of those old photos, I've just drifted along, waiting for time travel." I wrung my hands. "It's been ten years already.  Ten years of people avoiding me—or worse, actively trying to hurt me. Women won't date me. Nobody will hire me.  I am pretty sure that the government has people following me."  I pointed to a man in a suit, standing near a tree.  The man waved.  "See?"<br />
"I know it's hard," said the old man. "And, unfortunately, it won't get any easier."<br />
"What do you mean?"<br />
"Your life. It won't get any easier."  The old man sighed. "It's hard to have a wife if you're hopping through time. Hard to have a family, to raise children."<br />
"Oh great, thanks for that."  I rolled my eyes. "Very inspirational." <br />
"It's the truth." The old man shrugged. "You are going to do some very important work. It will have to be enough for you."<br />
I looked at the old man.<br />
He gave me a small smile. "What if I told you that your sacrifice will save millions of lives?" He gestured towards the people in the park—the moms with their strollers, the children, the young men playing frisbee. "All of these people, their parents, grandparents.  Their children, too.  You will save them, although you will always travel alone, it is true. But with your help, humanity will avoid several major catastrophes."<br />
"Is that why I kill that painter?"<br />
"Yes."<br />
"What happens if I don't?"<br />
The man stared into the distance. He opened his mouth to speak but closed it and stood.<br />
"It is better if I show you," he said. "Come with me. It's time to begin your training."<br />
My mouth dropped. "Wait a second... this is it? Right now?"<br />
The old man nodded.<br />
I stood up.  We begin walking.<br />
"Wait," I said.  "How do you know all this stuff?"<br />
My eyes widened.  "Oh my god..." I lowered my voice.  "Are you... me? From the future?"<br />
"No," said the old man, shaking his head with a chuckle. 
"I'm your son."  </p>

<h1>[WP] Your roommate is 2nd most powerful superhero in the world and he will not shut up about it. He does not yet know that you are the 1st.</h1>
<p>Score: 1945</p>
<p>I never understood why every superhero out there wore capes. I swear, the amount of raw fabric he goes through must be inversely proportionally to his IQ. My roommate is the self proclaimed "Second Most Powerful Hero to ever live." Never mind he hasn't ever faced off against any truly powerful super villain. Those were taken care of years upon years ago. </p>
<p>Let's break it down. Ryan, my roommate, has; heat vision, frost breath, super strength, skin that can stop bullets and lasers, the ability to breathe in space, and a laundry list of other abilities. He's made me time him flying to the moon and back. Usually I don't have time to press the stop watch. He's all hot air. Well, unless you put these funny green or red rocks near him. Something to do with his home world and all that. </p>
<p>I digress. Today has been strange indeed. He's insisted, once again that I time him. Something about wanting to feel his ranking. I kind of tune him out when he starts going on these rants about his powers. I just kind of tick on my fingers the ones that he's listed. More than anything I just want to tell him to shut up most of the time. However, I really can't. You see, I have a certain ability. An ability that makes the world a much better place than anyone can dream of. Day in and day out I save the world over and over again from a threat that's possibly strong enough to destroy the universe. I keep the idiots in the world cloaked in their own little bubbles. No supervillian has risen in my lifetime, nor will any. </p>
<p>If you haven't guessed yet. I am the most powerful superhero in existence. Not because of the powers I have, but because of what I do. I keep the biggest, most powerful idiot in existence, well, entertained. Well, that, and I can make a lot of copies of myself. So, for every hero that's out there I'm there. I'm watching them all drone on about being number two. After all, no one is more dangerous than someone with something to prove. However, when you're proving it to someone that doesn't care then the world is a much better place. </p>

<p>"Your move, God." Dexicon roared, knowing it had the ancient deity in its proverbial palm.</p>
<p><em>Shit shit shit</em>  thought God. It was tough to display no emotion but a strong poker face was crucial. Dexicon had already taken Zeermon out the game and had now moved on to God.</p>
<p>God had not been blessed with much luck.  Each deity had been given a species that had space travel potential. The objective was to either enslave or obliterate the other species. God had unfortunately randomised the least intelligent possible species - homo.</p>
<p>2.7  million years just to leave the hunter gatherer stage. This was a new record. He had had to wipe out his first few species of homo and start over - they had simply been too stupid. By the time he had rerandomised into homo-sapien he was at least 2.6 million years behind Dexicon. </p>
<p>What didnt help was that the homo-sapiens turned out to be incredibly aggresive. This would be useful for fighting other species, but they mainly killed each other! Oh how Dexicon and Zeermon laughed! </p>
<p>When he had finally researched the abilty to send a vassel to Earth to enlighten and guide the people, the earthlings did something unprecedented in stupidity - they decided to kill it.</p>
<p>Finally the humans became space able. At the time, God was pleased. They visited their local moon first, as expected. But the moon base never came. The colonisation of nearby planets never came. They regressed.</p>

<p>"Good for them," Zolforat commented as they observed humans farming the cradle of civilization. "Tools and agriculture? Why, they're looking positively sentient."</p>
<p>"Real moxy," Mefro, Zolforat's companion, agreed. "I can hardly understand how they manage to stand up like that!" It stamped its twelve hooves in emphasis. "And in <em>that</em> gravity? They're lucky to be more than a foot tall!"</p>
<p>Zolforat put the ship back into gear. "Real shame about them. If they ever had a chance to develop beyond simple tools, they might be quite interesting to meet." They zipped off toward their final destination and forgot about the rapidly-spinning blue planet in almost no time.</p>
<hr />
<p>"I say, <em>those</em> are the humans?" Zolforat gasped on the way toward refueling in the atmosphere of one of Jupiter's moons. Down on the surface, they observed a city of over a million right in the center of an oddly shaped peninsula. Boats of wood sailed the seas, and stone roads criss-crossed the continent. "Well I'll be damned! They developed this much in just a few thousand orbits?? Why, look at all that!"</p>
<p>"Stone buildings!" Mefro whispered, awestruck. "In <em>that</em> gravity? Can you imagine?"</p>
<p>Zolforat was astounded. "I know! But cheers to them for making it this far! Glad we got to see them at their peak!"</p>
<hr />
<p>"What in the... Mefro, you've got to see what they've done now!" The two had made quite the hobby of watching the poor backwards humans. It was inspiring, watching them try their hardest. But also depressing, knowing that they were trapped on that little rock for the rest of time. "They're using <em>steam</em> for power!"</p>
<p>Mefro seemed impressed. "Clever little devils! I kind of almost want to see them try to make it to orbit."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't say that," Zolforat chided his companion. "There isn't enough water on the planet to produce enough steam to make it into orbit. They wouldn't even hit the second atmosphere layer before plummeting back down. Poor little guys."</p>
<p>"I know," Mefro said. "You're right; I shouldn't have said that. I'm just proud of them for making it this far." The two had developed almost <em>paternal</em> feelings for the poor little human buggers. </p>
<p>"Farewell, humans!" Zolforat told them as the two went off on their way again. "What do you think, Mefro: will they have discovered electricity by the time we return?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Their ship hovered over the burnt remains of a city on an island in the little blue planet's largest ocean. Scanners confirmed what the two already feared: radioactive fallout. This had been a <em>nuclear</em> detonation. Surveillance video from the drone they'd left in orbit showed another chilling discovery: long-range rockets traveling a distance of over 200 miles, packed with explosives. It should have been impossible with that level of gravity, but the damned humans had done it. With just a little more power, one of those could break orbit! On the surface, <em>millions</em> upon <em>millions</em> of humans teemed on every continent, in unimaginable numbers. And it was getting more and more crowded by the second. </p>
<p>"Uh...." Zolforat finally managed to take four of his eyes off of the screen to look back at Mefro. "We... uh... we should probably tell someone about this."</p>

<p>Score: 1708</p>
<p>I’m not an animal person. I swear that every single cat that I’ve ever crossed paths with has plotted my murder; the circumstances of my premature death leave open the possibility that one of them succeeded… stainless steel food bowls don’t push themselves off of 5th floor balconies. So when I entered the Eternal Judgment Court room, and saw a smug looking Sphynx eyeing me with hate-filled eyes, I knew I was fucked.
Countless “witnesses” were called, all of them silver tongued felines with nothing but disparaging accounts against my character; they recounted slights I committed against animal kind, that I didn’t even remember or believe were true.</p>
<p>“I once saw the defendant kick a pigeon.”</p>
<p><em>Complete bullshit</em></p>
<p>“The defendant has been known to attempt to run various cats over with his vehicle.”</p>
<p><em>Another false allegation</em></p>
<p>“The defendant once tortured a naive kitten for hours with The Red Dot!”</p>
<p><em>OK, that one is true</em></p>
<p>Even the more friendly dogs had little to say about me, and what good they tried to add on my account was brushed aside by the Sphynx as “most likely embellished flattery”. But at least they tried to stick up for me. Every type of animal I had ever interacted with in my entire life was called to testify, and after days it seemed that nothing would be said to grant me eternal happiness. I was to be damned for all eternity by the very breed of despicable little creatures that ended my time on earth.</p>
<p>The Sphinx raised his gavel, “If no other animal has any testimony to proffer on behalf of this human then by my rights as Supreme Judge of Animal Kind I hereby…”
“Wait!” A low and small voice says, from the floor behind be.
I turn around to see a small turtle pushing his way through the large courtroom doors.
“Wait… I have… something to say.” The turtle pants as he crawls forward, finally free of the doors. “I was sunbathing on a log one day, when some mean kids came and picked me up and started tossing me around,” </p>
<p><em>Oh great, am I supposed to have been one of these little hooligans?</em></p>
<p>“One dropped me, and I landed on my back. I was helpless, and they just laughed. But this human, he came over and yelled at the other kids until they went away. Then he picked me up, and carried me back to my log and set me back down in the sun.”</p>
<p>I was stunned; until now I had completely forgotten about that day. I was six, maybe seven, and I had been at the lake with my family. Who knows where my parents were, they weren’t the most attentive parents in the world. But I had seen a group other kids tossing what I thought was a ball, and wanting to join in the fun had run over to them. When I got closer I saw that it wasn’t a ball they were tossing, but a turtle, and for some reason this enraged me and I flew into a fury, yelling and throwing sand at the other kids to “stop teasing the poor turtle.”
I looked at the small creature by my foot, tears beginning to well up in my eyes. “Thank you” I mouthed, too emotional to actually get the words out. The turtle just gave a small slow dip of his head.</p>
<p>“In light of this new testimony, the Eternal Judgement Court does so recognize that this human once offered vital assistance to a fellow animal, at potential risk to his own person.” My heart was lifting with every word. “However this one action does not erase a lifetime of malice towards other animal. The defendant is hereby sentenced to a lifetime of damnation.”</p>
<p><em>Shit, fucking cats.</em></p>

<p>Alexander walked through the gallery of The Bat. Generations of his family were portrayed as the Dark Knight of their time. Dressed in full armour and the cowl under their arm. Some had their respective Robin standing besides them. He stopped at the last portrait in the gallery. It portrayed the first Batman.</p>
<p>Alexander was looking the painting of Bruce Wayne in the eyes. That was quite the feat, considering the painting was over two and a half meters off the ground. The man in the picture was small compared to the latest Master of Wayne manor.</p>
<p>"Hello Bruce." Alexander whispered, looking into the grey eyes. Generations of Batmen had protected Gotham, Earth and the Solar System from the all evils that could be brought to bear. But it was still Bruce Wayne that was revered amongst his successors, and Alexander was his greatest fan.</p>
<p>"It's finally time." he continued, "The elders called me into the chamber last night. They initiated me into the order of the Bat. I'm the new Batman." Alexander looked around the gallery, checking he was alone before continuing. "I'm scared. I'm not nearly as strong as father, nor as fast as grandfather. I'm the first Batman in six generations who isn't physically better than the one before him." </p>
<p>His gaze had drifted down from the portrait to the ground. "But I am smarter than my dad. I've done better at school than him, I even have a doctorate. But that can't be enough to be Batman"</p>
<p>A cough was heard at the beginning of the hall. Alexander turned his gaze, worried that someone caught his confession, his fears. The sound originated from a slight man, long, thin and dressed in a fine black suit with white shirt. "Master Alexander." the man said in a crisp English accent. 
"Alfred..." Alexander answered softly, embarrassed and worried.</p>
<p>"I heard what you said there, Master Alexander." Alfred continued, stepping towards the young man.
"You're not going to tell father, are you?" Alexander asked worried. In the past, these confessions of weakness were not welcome in the Wayne family.</p>
<p>The butler smiled friendly and put his hand reassuringly on Alexander's shoulder. "Of course not, Master Alexander. Truth be told, I've heard these same worries from many of your ancestors over the years." Alfred gestured through the gallery of portraits. </p>
<p>"Your father was the strongest Batman Gotham ha ever seen, but he was brutal and unforgiving, like his father before him. But your great-grandfather, Derik Wayne, was not near as harsh. Every Wayne has lent their own ideas to the mantle of the Bat. But you remind me of the first Dark Knight."</p>
<p>Alfred smiled as he thought back. "Master Bruce was probably the smartest Batman we've had, though Masters Dick and Damian were not not far behind him. He was the master strategist for the Justice League and one of its chief scientists and detectives." His eyes looked up to find Alexander's. "And that, Master Alexander, is where I think you can shine as well. You will do great..."</p>
<p>Alfred's body disappeared as the AI with the butler's memories shut itself off, knowing it gave the encouragements that were needed. He had done so for generations.</p>

<p><em>I gotta get the fuck outta here before he discovers that I'm Supersonic Girl</em>, thought Carly Jackson to herself. </p>
<p>"And I'm coming for you. . ."</p>

<p>"So you might as well make it easier on everyone and come to meet me."</p>
<p>All thirty kids in the classroom -- each one of them endowed with a different set of superhuman powers -- shifted in their seats, looked around uncomfortably, and wondered what they would do. Each of them had just resolved to make their respective moves when the thin, bespectacled frame of Mr. Galvan stood up from behind his desk at the front of the room. </p>
<p>"Kids," said Mr. Galvan, "I know this may come as a shock to you. But I'm actually a superhero called The Galvanizer. Gravatrix is my archenemy. I'll be back in time for dismissal. Stay where you are and don't give Mr. Richards any problems. He can read minds, you know."</p>

Before it had even touched down a group of men jumped out of the door. Every officer involved in the standoff gasped: the Eh Team! Rumor had it that Canada's most notorious outlaw mercenaries used to be Mounties themselves, but got caught pulling off a robbery in the National Bank of Canada! And now they were <em>working</em> for the <em>Prime Minister</em>? </p>
<p>The leader of the Eh Team approached one of the officers on the scene. He wore a camouflage hunting jacket, had a nub of a cigar sticking out the side of his mouth, and carried his trusty hunting rifle. "I'm Colonel Smith. What's this all aboot, then? What's the situation?"</p>
<p>The officer managed to stammer his way through the explanation: Seven kidnappers were in the warehouse. Five on the bottom floor guarding the entrances, and two on the top floor, along with the Prime Minister's daughter. And they claimed to have set up booby traps for anyone trying to breach the building. </p>
<p>"Got it." As the members of his team took up positions around the perimeter, Smith snatched the megaphone out of the officer's hand. Then he stepped forward under the yellow tape and held it up to his mouth. "Hey, you all in there!"</p>
<p>Gun barrels poked out the window in response. "You got our money?" someone finally called out. </p>
<p>"No, no." Smith took the cigar from his mouth and extinguished it into the pavement. It was time for some <em>action</em>. "I just thought you all might want to know that the Prime Minister is really upset about this whole business. This kidnapping stuff? It's <em>really</em> rude, OK?"</p>
<p>The gun barrels lowered. "Gosh, we didn't even realize," one of the kidnappers called back. </p>
<p>"Yeah," Smith continued. "Really caused a lot of trouble for everyone. So why don't we all put the guns down and settle this like gentlemen over a pint of Moosehead?"</p>
<p>There was a brief silence... then the kidnappers emerged from the warehouse with the Prime Minister's daughter. </p>
<p>"We're really sorry," one of them told Smith. "We had no idea."</p>
<p>Smith shook the man's hand and grinned. "Hey, don't worry about it, bud. We all make mistakes, you know?" He signaled to a nearby officer. "Get us a two-four, won't you?"</p>
<p>The Eh Team, the kidnappers, and the Prime Minister's daughter all popped open their bottles of delicious beer and toasted to the Queen. Smith took a sip of the refreshing beverage and pulled another cigar from his pocket. "I love it when a plan comes together, eh?"</p>

<p>"All those years," said Joe, waving the shotgun, "you guys gave me shit for bringing my gun to D&amp;D."  </p>

<p>"You said my shotgun <em>scared</em> you. You said the Second Amendment didn't <em>matter.</em> But now, with a literal <em>orc</em> in the basement, I don't hear anybody complaining!"  </p>
<p>"Actually, Joe," said Grokk, selecting his words carefully, "as I recall, the Second Amendment thing was more your talking point than theirs. If you don't mind me saying."  </p>
<p>"Shut your mouth," snapped Joe. "I've seen your charisma stat. It's not going to work on me."  </p>

<p>"Oh, so you think Jared's a better fit?"  </p>
<p>On the table, a miniaturized version of their friend Jared ran terrified circles around a can of root beer, an equally-miniaturized kobold hot on his heels. </p>
<p>"eee miii mii eee meee!!" squeaked Jared.   </p>

<p>"I just want a fair chance," said Grokk. "Isn't that what this country was built on?"  </p>
<p>"Look," said Joe, "we're gonna power-level Jared. The moment he hits level 10, we're wishing things right back to the way they were."  </p>
<p>"Aw, come on, man," said Grokk. "Don't be like that."  </p>
<p>Joe glared.  </p>
<p>"Remember how I saved your Elf Ranger? Priscilla? I took a ballista bolt for her, Joseph!"  </p>
<p>The glare continued in all its unibrowed glory.  </p>
<p>"Look! If you let me stay, I'll tell you how to get <em>her</em> into the real world too! Wouldn't you like that? A tall, slender elf to keep you company during these frigid north-Florida nights?"  </p>

<p>"That's impossible," he said.  </p>
<p>"Well," said Grokk, "I'm here, aren't I?"  </p>
<p>Joe studied the orc's pleading face. He thought about his elf ranger, the drawings of her that he kept in the secret journal under his pillow back home... her long, slim legs... her preposterously-large, almond-shaped eyes...  </p>
<p>He put the shotgun down.  </p>

<p>"You know," Ivy started, stroking the purring ball of fur snuggled in her arms. "I always knew you were a crazy cat lady, Selina but this time you've lost it."</p>
<p>"Coming from the woman who treats plants better than she does people." I said from my spot at the windowsill. </p>
<p>Ivy looked up at me with a sad expression and I glanced away, observing the room instead. Her small apartment looked more like a greenhouse than a living area. Every wall had vines tracing up and down and potted flowers bloomed throughout. I had seen it all before, but I didn't want to meet her gaze right that moment. </p>
<p>"He's gone, Selina. When are you going to accept that?"</p>
<p>My nails dug into the palms of my hand hard enough for them to bleed. </p>
<p>"I'm not going to accept that, Ivy. There's no way he's lost to me. No way."</p>
<p>Ivy made an unintelligible sound of frustration. "Wake up already. I know you've been gone a while but the Joker, Freeze, Penguin and even Bane are already dead. And the Justice League is afraid. Hell, I'm afraid."</p>
<p>"Something bad happened," I said. "But I can bring him back."</p>
<p>"What did it? In three years no one has figured out what made him cross the line."</p>
<p>My hand unconsciously drifted across my stomach, remembering. "I already sent out an invitation." I said, changing the subject and reaching into my pocket. </p>
<p>"What kind of invitation?"</p>
<p>A light toss sent the phone across the room. Vines dropped from the ceiling to catch it and Ivy repositioned the black cat as she reached out for it. </p>
<p>"Password is catz." I said. "With a Z."</p>
<p>"Figures." She mumbled, tapping the screen. As soon as it was unlocked the video started to play and her eyes went wide. "You didn't, Selina. I didn't even think he was alive."</p>
<p>"Bruce keeps the man guarded like a president."</p>
<p>"Then how did you kidnap Alfred?" </p>
<p>"I'm a thief. I take things. And kidnapping sounds worse than it is. He's just at my apartment drinking tea."</p>
<p>"You're crazy. He's going to kill you."</p>
<p>"Maybe." I said, looking out into the night, knowing that there were only a few hours between me and seeing him again. "But I have to try."</p>
<hr />
<p>Lightning flashed across the sky and I sighed, knowing he was behind me. He hadn't made a sound, the night was his. Yet he had also been mine and I knew him like no one else. At least I thought I did. </p>
<p>"Where is he, Selina?" His voice rumbled like a storm cloud and I shivered in the warm rain. It was still familiar. </p>
<p>"Safe." I said, turning to face him. There was no more gray in his costume, it was all black. If not for the glowing eyes he would've been invisible against the wall he leaned on. I knew it was for my benefit that he was even letting himself be seen. </p>
<p>"Don't make me take him from you."</p>
<p>"You need to get a grip Bruce. None of this is you. Everyone in the city is afraid. What happened to-"</p>
<p>"The city is safe!" He yelled and I jumped in surprise. I'd never seen him lose his cool so quickly. "Safer than it ever was when those madmen were running around."</p>
<p>"At what cost?" I asked. "You can't keep this up Bruce. Sources tell me you barely even sleep anymore and the morgue is filling up faster than the prison."</p>
<p>"You mean Alfred."</p>
<p>"I do, he loves you Bruce. I love you. We want you to come back to us, leave the Bat behind."</p>
<p>There was a heavy silence between us, filled by the falling rain. </p>
<p>"You left, Selina." He said finally. "Now you have the nerve to come back and tell me this?" </p>
<p>My throat constricted and I turned back to the skyline, unable to look at him in that moment. Memories assaulted me with enough strength to put me on my knees. My stomach heavy, Bruce's smiling face whenever he felt the kicks, the laughter of a madman ringing out while I lay bleeding followed by the ragged scream of a man who had lost one thing too many. </p>
<p>I cleared my throat best I could but my words still came out as a whisper. "I couldn't handle it, Bruce. It wasn't fair to you and I hate myself for it but all I could do was run. Run from the sadness in your eyes, the pain of knowing what we had lost. I ran from the city itself, this place has taken everything from me. Even you."</p>
<p>Silence answered me again and I spun, wondering if he had disappeared while my back was turned. Instead I came face to face with his huge form standing inches away from me. Mask covering whatever was going through his head.</p>
<p>"I know why you ran." He said, voice revealing nothing. "And I took all of our pain out on this city. It deserved to bleed. It still does. Yet here you are."</p>
<p>"Here I am." I whispered. "I've come back to you Bruce. I never should have left."</p>
<p>"Bruce died on the same night as our child, Selina. There's nothing left of him."</p>
<p>I reached out slowly and put my hand against his chest. When he didn't move I wrapped my arms around him, not caring that I wouldn't be able to defend myself if he was too far gone. This was my only chance.</p>
<p>"I don't believe you." I said into his chest. "If Bruce is dead, then you can leave right now. Alfred will have already returned to the manor. But if any trace of you is still in there...hold me. That's all I ask."</p>
<p>I don't know how long I stood there, soaking up the rain. The man I had my arms around was like a statue, he barely breathed. Minutes passed before I felt him grab my shoulders to push me away. And I was glad for my own mask as my heart shattered once again. Except he didn't let go, he just stood there, holding me at arm's length. </p>
<p>"You can't leave again." He said. </p>
<p>"I won't. Never again."</p>
<h2>Then his arms pulled me forward and crushed me in a hug that I never wanted to end.</h2>
<h1>[WP] For years Earth cried out to an empty cosmos, searching the stars for echoes of life. From the middle of nowhere, a reply finally comes: "Shut up, and Play Dead!"</h1>
<p>Score: 1399</p>
<p>Scholars never ceased to write about how amazingly fast humanity came together when an existential threat was proven to loom over our continued existence. </p>
<p>We first received The Signal about 30 years ago, right when I had first joined the SETI team. After five years of painstaking work, linguists were confident that it translated to the English equivalent of “Shut Up, and Play Dead!” We had double checked our translation, running The Signal through dozens of double blind international teams, all working simultaneously to ensure accuracy and speed (I had sheepishly -- and wrongly -- suggested that maybe the aliens were just Jerry Garcia fans).</p>
<p>So, faced with such bluntness, we united. Humanity willingly set itself back nearly a hundred years to a pre-Information Age culture. Satellites came down and GPS went dark. No more internet or television signals beaming across the cosmos. The loose confederation of countries that had formed the U.N. now became a strict regulatory agency to ensure that no country took advantage of the global blackout and to enforce the one rule of our survival: stay quiet and don’t move a muscle.</p>
<p>I knew that across the world were many teams working on trying to parse out even a sliver of additional information from the message so they could figure out how to prepare for this unknown threat. However, above all, our team had been transformed from a barely funded back-of-the-envelope operation to the first line of defense. We had to keep scanning for new signals -- quietly.</p>
<p>Now, instead of doing it with bold detectors openly beaming bragging signals into space, I hide in a small bunker nearly a mile under the surface, painstakingly scanning the sky light year by light year. After much deliberation, the bigwigs in charge of humanity’s survival decided that masking our search as standard background radiation was a risk worth taking. We weren’t sending the signals, but we could keep scanning the sky, like a mouse keeping an eye out for a hawk from the top of its burrow. I’m all alone down here; just the machines sweeping the sky and me. I take month long shifts before being relieved and there are dozens of these hole-in-the-ground stations around the globe, all pointing at different parts of the sky.</p>
<p>My display screen has just started beeping. For first time in 30 years, I have caught a glimpse of the talons in the sky. The new signal comes in fast, 1s and 0s filling my screen. I quickly check the localizer and see that this time the message is coming from several light years in a different direction than our original Signal. What does this mean? Are our secret guardians on the move? Or has someone else found us? Did we accidentally twitch a limb and now the hawk is taunting us?</p>
<p>I’m simply supposed to relay the pure, untranslated signal to higher authorities, but I can’t help but see if the auto-translate they have installed in our machine can at least give me the essence of this new message. My heart is racing as I wonder at the depths of the prophecy I hold in my hands. The translation only takes a minute -- the code is the same as The Signal. Words begin to fill up my screen:</p>
<h2>“Third planet of Sol: why have you gone dark? Please don’t tell us you fell for that old [garbled name] trick; they just want to keep their trading monopoly in this area. Please signal back if you have any [list of elements begins to fill the screen].”</h2>

<p>Tommy, Todd, and Frank had never actually played Dungeons and Dragons before. But they knew that Luke was a huge fan of it, and so they had looked up a quick guide on google before inviting him over to play. It was kind of turning out to be a disaster, but they were doing the best that they could do. </p>
<p>Tommy acted as DM. Todd and Frank were both elves, which may or may not have made sense depending on the context. Luke was, indeed, the only one who knew what he was doing.</p>
<p>"Are you guys high or something?" he asked, as they played. The three other boys looked to each other, before Tommy cleared his throat and suddenly exclaimed, "Oh, Luke, you have come across an enemy!" </p>
<p>"It's not my tu--"</p>
<p>"An enemy!" Tommy exclaimed, using enthusiasm. "Oh, it is an evil um...witch?" he turned to Frank and Todd, giving them a look that asked, <em>Do witches exist in this game?</em> They both met his bewildered gaze in turn. Luke didn't pipe up, just waited for Tommy to finish talking.</p>
<p>"Yes. An evil witch. Named. Um. Livian."</p>
<p>"Livian like...Vivian?"</p>
<p>"No, no, no, not at all. Like Livian of olde. She was an ancient...um...sorceress...in--"</p>
<p>"Camelot?" Todd asked-rather-than-told.</p>
<p>"She was Merlin's arch nemesis," Frank piped up. </p>
<p>"No, that was Nimue or Viviane," Luke told them.</p>
<p>"Oh then definitely it's Viviane," Tommy said. "Yes. Viviane. She's known for being a manipulative bi---witch. Who kind of treats her boyfriends poorly. And doesn't appreciate them."</p>
<p>Luke just looked at Tommy. After a silence he said, "So am I going to roll to see who attacks first or...?"</p>
<p>"I'll roll," Tommy says. "Official house rules. And you can't look."</p>
<p>"Guys, what is this about?" Luke asked. </p>
<p>"Just let me roll," said Tommy. Luke closed his eyes and Tommy rolled the die. "Oh, you get to go first, I think!" Tommy exclaimed. </p>
<p>"Guys, is this about Vivian?" Luke asked.</p>
<p>The three others exchanged a look. Luke opened his eyes. "I'm not twelve years old with an IQ of 57. I know you guys don't know how to play this game."</p>
<p>"We looked it up for like ten minutes," Todd said. "It's kind of complicated and hard to learn on the fly."</p>
<p>"We don't like your girlfriend," Frank said. "And she treats you like crap, man. And you should break it off." </p>
<p>"And to try and make that point we tried to learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons for you, man," Todd said. </p>
<p>"Because we are good friends," Tommy said. </p>
<p>Luke looked at them. "You guys, Vivian broke up with me two weeks ago."</p>
<p>"Oh," Todd said. "Well uh...good, I guess." </p>
<p>"You guys want to get some pizza?" said Tommy. "I have no idea how to play this game." </p>
<p>"I'm game," said Frank.  </p>
<p>"Let's do it," said Todd.</p>
<p>"You guys really didn't know that Vivian dumped me?" asked Luke. </p>

<p>"Nothing." The reply was immediate and absolute. They were in the final phase of their training, and there was only one test left. Stav turned, his eyes sweeping up and down the faces of the clandestine service officers.</p>

<p>"I-I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about."</p>
<p>"No?" Stav reached into his pocket and took out a piece of paper, unfolding it. "How about a castle in Scotland?" </p>

<p>"And then we'll pay for a shopping spree at Chanel," the slow grin spread across his face as Yolanda's mouth dropped open, her hands clutching at her heart.</p>
<p>"Gregor is in the black site two hundred kilometers south of here!" she cried. "I can get you in!"</p>

<p>I had guarded over Doris for her entire life. It had been a long, and very productive run. I looked in through the hospital window to see her surrounded by her six children, twenty grandchildren and fifty-six great-grandchildren. It was a big hospital room.<br />
Her time had now come, and it was time to take her up to the big man. I slid open the window and climbed into the room, and much to my shock the people in the room looked over to me.<br />
“Who the fuck are you?”<br />
I froze. In my four thousand year career in service of Jehovah no human who wasn’t a pope or totally insane had ever tried talking directly to me. <br />
“Ur… can you see me?”<br />
“Of course I can, now what the fuck are you doing climbing in through my mother’s hospital window?” Spoke Jeremy, Doris’ oldest son. I had saved him from a rabid dog when he was 11.<br />
“I’m, uh, I’m your mother’s guardian angel. I’m here to take her to heaven.”<br />
“What are you? Some kind of pervert?” Said Giselle, one of Doris’ granddaughters. I had coordinated the prayer campaign to cure her pancreatic cancer a few years back.<br />
“No no no, I was sent by Jehova to bring Doris to ever-lasting bliss.”<br />
“That's sick mate, why don’t you fuck off back out your window?” Said Harold.   I’d prevented four drunk driving accidents that he should have caused in the last three months.<br />
His tone rather annoyed me, and I tried to push through to get to Doris.   “Honestly, I must insist you let me…” A fist collided with my face and I found myself flat on the floor.   </p>
<p>I woke up in the drunk tank. I started slamming on the door and a police officer appeared.<br />
“You have to let me go!” I yelled out to him. “I’m a servant of God!”<br />

<h1>[WP] You are cursed with ever aging immortality with the exception you can be killed using one object. Every few years you get a hint.</h1>

<p>Every five years, I receive a package in the mail. It comes even when there is no mail service, like when Sherman was rampaging his way through the South. A single delicately-crafted golden puzzle piece with intricate cursive handwriting on it. Taunting me, revealing bits and pieces of information of where I might find the <em>only</em> weapon that can kill an immortal. Each box comes wrapped in delicate red wrapping paper with a fine Italian silk ribbon, reminding me of my origins back in Europe. Back where I first met the witch. </p>
<p>Today, the last piece arrived. I had to have my assistant Luthor open the package, given that I can hardly move. See, unfortunately, immortality doesn't keep me forever young the way it does in fairy tales. No, I've kept on aging until I'm just a bitter, dried-out husk of a human being. I haven't left my bed since the American Revolution. I have, however, made several investments over the years that have given me the wealth needed to maintain a lavish lifestyle and a veritable army of servants to do my bidding.</p>
<p>Normally, I <em>hate</em> this day: April 8. It's a taunt from my eternal tormentor. But today is different: the final piece has come, 750 years to the date that I first gained this curse in a desperate bid to escape the Black Plague. I suppose the witch has decided that I've suffered enough. Or perhaps she has simply run out of ways to stall. With a soft <em>clink</em>, Luthor places the piece in the frame where I've collected all of the pieces over the years.</p>
<p>"What does it say?" I gasp. My voice sounds like a whisper of wind between corn stalks. I'm unable to open my eyes to read the inscription for myself. </p>
<p>"It says you need the sword of a crusader that has been blessed at the High Temple of Jerusalem," he answered. Luthor is one of the few servants that I've entrusted with my secret, in part because he can fluently read and speak Latin, which is what the clues are written in. </p>
<p>"That's all?" Somehow I'd expected it to be some sort of last challenge. Some famous king's blade, or some rare magical object. My bet was actually on the Holy Lance, which is why I went to such lengths to find and acquire it.  But <em>this</em> was nothing. I'd been collecting ancient weaponry ever since I amassed my fortune, hoping that I just might have the relic I needed when the time came. I had at least a <em>hundred</em> swords from crusaders, on both sides of the conflict. "Luthor, have them prepare the jet. We're going to Israel. And have any sword in the vault from the crusader period brought on board."</p>
<p>"Very good." I can hear him exit the room; thank god for modern devices like hearing aids. </p>
<p>I've wanted to kill myself for <em>centuries</em> now. I was already a hunched, bedridden old cripple even back when I first came to the Colonies. My mind is still sharp, but my body has withered away to nothing until it was just a prison. I'm not even a man anymore: most of my parts are artificial. I don't need them to keep me alive, but the doctors have done what they can to improve my quality of life. These puzzle pieces are the only thing that have kept me going; the only reason I have to live.</p>
<p>No, I don't look forward to them for the clues. That's certainly important, because I'll need the blessed sword. No, my main motivation now is <em>hate</em>. Hatred for the witch that did this to me, and has continued to torment me through the years. The witch that is as old as I am. And if that's the case, then maybe the sword won't just be good for killing me, though I know she expects me to take that out. I think I can hold on a little longer... at least until my small mercenary army finds her. I just hope that I still have the strength to hold the sword; I would like to end her myself, if at all possible.</p>

<h1>[WP] Humanity finally reaches the edge of the solar system only to encounter an impassible barrier and a warning not to try and breach it. But is it there to keep us in or to keep something else out?</h1>
<p>Score: 1187</p>
<p>Humanity was expanding.</p>
<p>It was time to go.</p>
<p>It had been 200 years since humans had reached the edge of the solar system. It had taken 2 years to journey that far back then, and now they could pass the expanse from the sun to the edge in just a few tens of minutes. But they could never pass it.</p>
<p>The great barrier hung, invisibly encompasing the system. When humans had first approached, not knowing the barrier was there, they were rocked by the strong magnetics fields. A signal had flashed across the whole of the visable spectrum. Lights turning on and off at high speed. They had found code easy to break, and understood it was a communication meant for them.</p>
<p>"Go back. Do not leave. Go back. Do not leave."</p>
<p>This had started an international crisis. Should they ignore it, and push through? The combined decision of the worlds elected leaders was no. At a vote tallying  90 to 60, the earth had decided to stay within the barrier.</p>
<p>The humans kept testing it. They found that both electromagnetic waves, and physical probes were allowed through, but anything containing biological matter was prevented from leaving. The first casualty of the barrier was one brave astronaut's ham sandwich. The testing continued, the message stayed the same, but then humanity moved on. </p>
<p>And then it expanded. First Mars, then Titan and orbital habitats around Venus and Jupiter. And they kept expanding. And in just 11 generations Humanity started to outgrow the resources of the solar system. </p>
<p>And so it came back to today. The day after polling day. Every human across the expanse of the solar system had been allowed to vote on the decision of whether or not to break through the barrier. The technology to do so had been available for 120 years.  </p>
<p>And the results came in. 96% voter turnout. 76:24 in favour of breaking through the barrier.</p>
<p>It was too late. They weren't ready yet. I couldn't even send another warning. It took all I had to maintain the barrier. I had tried. But they didn't even know what they were in for. I had watched them for so long, keeping them safe.</p>

<p>Bob Ross strapped into a leather chair, his hair bobbing ever so slightly. </p>
<p>"Are you sure about this, Bob? You could be killed. We need to be absolutely clear with you about the dangers present," the Time Delegation representative said firmly. "I know you've been training to speak German for some time in preparation, but if you find yourself unsure on the other side, disaster could befall us."</p>
<p>A warm smile crept across Bob's face. "I'm sure. You said this will prevent future catastrophe, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. It would likely allow for an Israeli state to be created with less haste, preventing the fighting and nuclear fallout that follows. I come from a time when that has already happened. We've tried to kill him, but it fails every time."</p>
<p>"I'd save millions in the past, and millions in the future. What better purpose could my life serve? I will try, my friend. Let's turn this mess into a beautiful, peaceful painting for the future."</p>
<p>The doors shut, engines whirred and within moments, Bob found himself in 1908 Austria outside of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where Hitler had just failed admission for the second time. Using several older photos for reference, he kept an eye on the entrance.</p>
<p>Several minutes later, Adolf stormed out of the building, throwing his paintings and screaming curses in German. Bob approached him once he'd sat down and cooled his head for a moment.</p>
<p>"Are you an artist?" Bob asked carefully.</p>
<p>Hitler looked up at him, sighing. "I am not. This school has rejected me twice now, so clearly I am no such thing."</p>
<p>"Schools have nothing to do with it; art comes from your soul. May I see your work? I am an artist as well."</p>
<p>Hitler pointed to the partially snapped painting on the ground. "I destroyed it in anger."</p>
<p>Picking it up, Bob verbally gaped at it. "This is incredible. You have extreme technical talent, unlike much I've seen."</p>
<p>"Thank you. Unfortunately, that's not enough, it seems."</p>
<p>"No, my friend. It's not. My name is Hans- what is yours?"</p>
<p>"Adolf. Are you from around here? Your accent is odd."</p>
<p>"I grew up overseas, but I love this country. Hey- do you have a studio?"</p>
<p>"I have a place I draw, yes."</p>
<p>"Can we maybe work a little together there? I think we could help each other."</p>
<p>Hitler looked down at the cement. "I quit art. There's nothing for me in this field."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's not true! You have too much talent to waste, friend. I would love a little help regarding precise measurements and detailed architecture. Schools are schools- don't let them tell you who you are."</p>
<p>Hitler marveled at Bob's warm smile and friendliness. "Sure. Yes, we can go now."</p>
<hr />
<p>They sat together in a small room, each with their own easel. Bob was scraping paint into a beautiful snowy forest, and Adolf was once again working on an architectural piece. </p>
<p>"Adolf, why don't you try mixing our ideas?"</p>
<p>"How do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, you draw amazing architecture, and I am a landscape master. I think if you drew a beautiful building against a backdrop of nature rather than a pure cityscape, I think it would give it life. See, a piece needs <em>life</em> and <em>personality</em> on top of skill. You are incredibly skilled, so much that you forget about the soul of it."</p>
<p>Adolf chewed on that for a moment, while continuing his building. He accidentally stroked too hard, leaving a blemish on the rooftop.</p>
<p>"Shit. Ah, see, I always mess up. Now I have to start over."</p>
<p>Bob smiled, placing a hand on his shoulder. "There are no mistakes, just happy little accidents." He swiped the blemish into an accent, shaping it into a bird and adding color.</p>
<p>"It's about the feeling, Adolf. It's about <em>you</em>."</p>
<p>He smiled and they continued to paint the day away.</p>

<h1>[WP] You are an archaeologist and have just dug up a dinosaur. That's because you've dug up an entire museum.</h1>
<p>Score: 1058</p>
<p>"Woah! A dinosaur!" I exclaimed as I gently put my shovel down. A tiny creature, no taller than a few inches, crawled out from a miniscule burrow in the sand at the bottom of the excavation site. I retrieved a magnifying glass from my satchel and used it to have a better look at the small creature. </p>
<p>It was a dark shade of green. Almost brown and slightly mottled in places. Curiously, it had a light coat of tan-coloured feathers covering its backside. The plumage glistened in the afternoon sunlight and even had an orange tinge to it at certain angles. The dinosaur crawled up on to my outstretched index finger and began awkwardly waddling up my glove.</p>
<p>"Fascinating," muttered my companion as he looked over my shoulder and watched the little critter crawl. "What else did we uncover?" He squatted down and used a smaller tool to brush away more of the dirt around the site where the dinosaur had crawled out of. No sooner had he done so when I heard a sharp <em>clack!</em> </p>
<p>"That sounds like you hit something. A buried chest?" I asked as the dinosaur hopped up and down on my open palm.</p>
<p>"Looks more like a small building than a treasure chest," my friend replied. He used a brush to dust off some dirt from the object. "Well I'll be darned."</p>
<p>It was a fancy looking building about the size of a mailbox or a large bread box. It was two stories tall and the bottom story was lined by a series of pillars that held the upper floor up. A small plaque near the entrance had the word <em>Museum</em> engraved on it. I put the dinosaur into a glass jar with air holes poked into the top before I went to have a closer look at the building.</p>
<p>With my magnifying glass hovering outside the windows of the museum, I peered inside. But before I could make anything out clearly, something flew out of one of the open windows. I stumbled backwards and swatted my hand around my face, thinking it was an insect. When I finally regained my composure, I saw a tiny spaceship darting around the outside of the museum. It flew around, bumbling about like a bee, before finally landing adjacent to my dinosaur jar.</p>
<p>"Gosh, this is amazing! We've stumbled onto a whole miniature museum full of surprises!" I said joyfully.</p>
<p>"Indeed!" replied my friend. "I can't believe we found all of this on our first try!"</p>
<p>"There's treasure everywhere!" I announced happily.</p>
<p>"Calvin!" yelled a female voice in the distance. "Come on in! It's time for dinner!"</p>
<p>"C'mon Hobbes. Better head back in before Mom throws a fit," I said to my tiger friend. I took him by his tail and dragged him out of the sandbox.</p>

<p>It just started as kind of a joke. I didn't actually think it would work. I read that XKCD comic, <strong><a href="http://xkcd.com/525/">I know you're listening</a></strong>.

<p>I started out by saying things that the audience might expect someone to say in a monologue, thinking that if it seemed like it was <em>supposed</em> to be a part of the script, then maybe it would get through. And for a while, it worked. I heard the laughs, and their responses back. </p>
<p>But after about a week, nothing. No more feedback. I've tried changing what I say, how I say it. I tell jokes. I sob and cry. But as far as I can tell, it's not getting through.

<p>I loved her, he says out loud when he starts writing her a letter:  </p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a girl. This girl, like most girls when they're 20 years old, has issues. She worries about the future, she worries because she has no idea what she wants to become. She thinks that happiness in life comes from the things she does and accomplishes. However, when all her work is done, she feels empty inside. She feels the burning sensation that might soon become a depression. When the work is done, so is she.  </p>
<p>Most importantly though, she believes that love is all about the butterflies she feels in her stomach. She does not believe in a God, per se, but she does believe that when she dies, she will be like a star, shining down upon us in the night.  </p>
<p>One day, she meets a man on the internet. She looked at his pictures and figured: what the hell, he looks good enough. She started chatting with him, started telling him all about her problems and he did the same. They fell in love.  </p>
<p>However, after a little while, she started losing her butterflies, as expected. She did not know whether the man was actually the cause of this or because she simply did not feel those wonderful feelings anymore.  </p>
<p>She started doubting him, hell, she even tried to change him. You see, he was a smoker. He was the kind of person who would live his life from day to day, and not worry about the past or the future. Someone who would risk his life, just so that he could die having lived a happy life.  </p>
<p>She did not understand why he would take those kinds of risks in life. After all, he knows well enough how painful and agonizing the death of a smoker can be.
She did not understand how someone would risk his or her life just to be happy. She did not understand happiness or what it meant simply because she never quite found out what made her happy.  </p>
<p>As time went on, and her workload increased, she started neglecting him. After all, university is her priority at the moment. In doing so, she made him question her.  </p>
<p>Why doesn't she want to go out anymore? Why doesn't she want to take a midnight walk with me? Undeniably so, he always sacrificed himself so that she could go on with a smile on her face. He did not understand why she could not make an hour of her time free to simply go out and have a drink. After all, the café was only 2 minutes away from her front door.  </p>
<p>As with any love story, things did not end well. Right before the end though, she even made him believe that because he started doubting her, that she did not love him anymore, while in reality she stopped loving him a long time ago but simply could not find the courage within herself to break his heart. After all, he was the kind of guy who would have died for her.  </p>
<p>So she said to him: Let's take a break. Let's just be ourselves for a while and see what happens. He simply did not understand. For three long weeks, he could not eat. He could not sleep and he could not even sit at his computer and play video games. She was on his mind 24/7. The entire day he would eagerly wait for a text message from her. She never sent one.  </p>
<p>But after those three weeks, he started seeing things differently. She was right. By becoming himself again, he finally understood why she left him. He could finally understand that in fact it wasn't because he doubted her, but because she does not understand the true meaning of love. He finally understood why she tried to change him.  </p>
<p>He wrote this story for her, not because he wanted to but because he needed to. He wrote this so that she could find her happiness in life, so that she could finally understand what love is and so that she could finally stop breaking peoples hearts. In the end though, he didn't do it for her, he did it for her future husband.
He wrote: "Once upon a time, there was a girl.."  </p>
<p>As he gave her the letter, and watched her read it, he felt those old emotions again. That stinging feeling of happiness and love. The idea that he can have a future with this person. He felt like he could have given her a different kind of letter. Maybe this was his chance to make things right again. Alas, the outcome would have been the same, he thought to himself.  </p>
<p>After she was done reading the letter, she bursts into tears, understanding exactly what the man had given her and asked him to hug her one last time. It was the most emotional hug of his life and as he left her there, he finally felt closure.  </p>

<p>Steeling himself for battle, Sir Galilwayne approached the mouth of the cave. The deep grunts of the sleeping dragon inside could be heard half a mile off. As soon as he entered the cave, he saw it: the Nameless One. Slayer of Sir Twainpac, Sir Fiddy Pence, and many other good knights. Strewn amongst the dragon's golden hoard were several suits of armor much like Galilwayne's own.</p>

<p>"Shit, son, you just got burned so bad you wouldn't even taste good. Just run off back to Camelot, yo."</p>

<p>Bruce Wayne stood stoically, looking at the footage from his arsenal of security cameras. He watched as an ever-growing crowd of reporters gather around his property, eager to find out even more about the man behind the cowl. They, at least, weren't making any attempt to hide. He wasn't very concerned about any darker dangers slowly creeping their way towards his old family manor, nor did he worry about any of his friends or family coming under threat from any of his old rogue's gallery. After all, there wasn't really anyone he could call a true friend at that point. </p>
<p>With one exception. He expected his dearest of companions, Alfred, to cheerily remind him the bat mobile was primed and ready to go, for his escape to be ready at any moment. Of course, he knew this would never come. He sighed deeply, thinking of his old butler, in a coma, and likely to remain that way for the remainder of his days, but a shadow of his former self. Bruce pushed these thoughts out of his mind for now, and instead thought of how he got himself into his predicament. </p>
<p>Defending the innocent wasn't cheap, especially not in the dark, amoral backwaters of Gotham, a city ridden with poverty and crime. If he was to continue with his nightly crusades, he needed more funds. How hilarious, the aging hero thought. He had gone up against cold mobsters, murderous sadists, monsters from hell, aliens, conquerors bent on world domination, and even the coming of the apocalypse itself; but alas, his greatest enemy was taxes. In order to overcome this most harrowing of foes, he resolved to create an offshore oil account, linked directly to Wayne Enterprises. Of course, Wayne Enterprises had no stake in the oil industry, but the Batman needed his supplies, and so it went. Money was laundered with this excuse, tax-free, which meant maximum revenue. At first, it was just a small percentage of his gains, but eventually it was where most of his income came from. He could continue to save the lives of the people he loved so dearly, without having to worry about dwindling finances.</p>
<p>Then, it all fell apart. The papers were leaked. Collapsing, falling, his identity was figured out, with sly journalists connecting the dots. His schemes, and the schemes of many others, were exposed to the public eye, for all to see. The dots were connected. He was discovered. Now, here he was, watching his entire life's work fall apart, his company investigated and torn apart, his mansion overwhelmed with reporters and police. Nobody had actually entered into his courtyard or into the interior of his home, but his live feed was showing the people were getting ready to do just that. Everyone wanted to talk to Batman, after all. Their hero.</p>
<p>It was all a farce. His greatest enemies always came back, regardless of what he did. It seemed like for every crook he put up, three more took their place. His hand hovered over a red button labeled only <em>destruct.</em> He had no reluctance. He knew would rid the world of his legacy if he had to. This was such a moment. He pressed the button.</p>
<p>The world watched in awe as Wayne Manor leaped into flames. Everything was destroyed. Anyone inside would be vaporized. Some of the people closer to the mansion experienced burns, and the shock wave was heard from miles around. The property was replaced with a large crater, with only the walls on the farthest edges of the once mighty homestead still remaining. The bat cave, and everything he had worked to achieve, was eviscerated. The Batman was no more.</p>
<p>In a shack in northern Canada, Bruce Wayne laughed for the first time in as long as he could remember. His plan had worked, as he knew it would. Whenever he contacted various news outlets regarding his money scheme, the pieces were set. The clues he laid out regarding his identity were obvious, his biggest concern being that someone like Batman would even leave such a clear trail. Of course, that didn't really matter now. He thought about the last thing Alfred had said to him.</p>
<p>"Stay true to yourself. Be who you want to be, not what others want you to be."</p>
<p>That part of his life was over. He shut off his computers. He looked out the window in his small house, the blank snow covering the landscape. Down the road, he could see a small fishing town situated right on the coast of the Atlantic, it slowly coming alive. This was the peaceful life he desired. Nobody would find him here, he made sure of it. As far as the world was concerned, Bruce Wayne was dead.</p>
<p>The myth of the dark knight lives on.</p>

<h1>[WP] You are in a zombie apocalypse, and are attacked by a horde of zombies and bitten. As you panic, you notice the zombie turning into a human.</h1>
<p>Score: 823</p>
<p>Six months. Everybody who had ever fantasised about a zombie apocalypse had imagined how long they would last. I was a realist, I had never thought I would get beyond two months, but in the end I managed to last three times that. All the more impressive because I was protecting my little sister.</p>
<p>We had been holding up in an old gas station, but this one summer’s night it was all going to come to an end. A breeze must have carried our scent towards the horde, we were getting pretty ripe. Around midnight the banging started on the door, I locked Lisa in the back room and sat guard with my dad’s old Colt. Usually the banging stopped after a few hours, but this night the zombies were persisting past day break.</p>
<p>Eventually the hinges gave way and a dozen zombies swarmed into the room, and began pouring towards me. I took down three of the shamblers before they reached me and knocked me to the floor. That was a new highscore. A male zombie bit into my leg, chewing off a huge chunk of flesh. I screamed in pain, as the other zombies started chowing down.</p>
<p>Through my tears I could see something happening to the zombie who bit me first. His skin was de-greying, his hair grew thicker and his eyes became clear and alert. He picked up the Colt and took out three of the other zombies.</p>
<p>“Where are the bullets?” he asked me. I patted to my left hand pocket. He reached in, loaded the gun back up and fired four more times.</p>
<p>“Is there anybody else here?” he asked. I hesitated before telling him about Lisa, but decided this stranger could do more for her now than I could.</p>
<p>“My little sister, back room, the key’s under the counter,” I said, blood spluttered on my lips, one of the zombies had taken a good chunk from my neck.</p>
<p>The man walked away from my line of vision, and as I heard him fiddling with keys I began to drift away. Until I heard the scream, Lisa screaming. With all my effort I turned around to see the man standing over Lisa, allowing another zombie to bite into my sister.</p>
<p>I tried to scream, but realised I had stopped breathing several minutes ago. I stared at the other zombie as she began her transformation back to humanity. Blond hair sprouted from her head and pink returned to her cheeks. She blinked her newly blue eyes and stood up to kiss the man.</p>
<p>As they embraced I could feel myself slipping away and an all-encompassing hunger started to consume my mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>I came to with a zombie standing over me. She was missing chunks of flesh and no longer had the happy glow about her, but I knew it was Lisa. I struggled to stand, everything was more difficult now. I took Lisa’s hand and lead her out of the gas station.</p>
<p>I could smell human on the wind, if we could get flesh I knew Lisa and I could start over.</p>

<h1>[WP] You somehow end up dating death. However, you have to deal with God and The Devil being overprotective older siblings.</h1>
<p>Score: 788</p>
<p>I was confused at first. Both God <em>and</em> the Devil told me it was a bad idea. Strange, to see them agree on something. They were both my elders, and both had shared responsibility for my well-being. God told me it was too rash to date Death. The Devil declared the union shouldn't have been possible. Not couldn't. <em>Shouldn't.</em> But what could I do?<br />
I loved Death.<br />
The broken things were what attracted me. Those minute moments. Loud silences. Death wandered from place to place as God willed. I followed. At first, because the path was blessed. Later, because I loved the chase. I felt the most <em>alive</em> being where Death was. <br />
So where Death passed, I stuck around for a while. Reveling in the remembered life that passed there.      <br />
It took long enough to get noticed. 
Then we shared, and walked together. Both the broken and the unbroken things about each other. For one thing, we liked wandering. Travelling aimlessly from place to place, experiencing the fullness of lives that once thrived on God's good Earth. The Devil watched, mindful that I was not straying from my own tasks (as older siblings do), but neither of them really understood. Too concerned with my well-being, that they didn't realize how... <em>perfect</em> this was. <br />
My job was at its most fulfilling in Death's shadow.<br />
For that, I loved Death.  <br />
And Death loved me. For who and what I was, not what I did. Such a miracle. A blessing. Of course this was where I wanted to be.  <br />
<em>Alright, but we warned you.</em>    <br />
I felt the most alive being where Death was.<br />
<em>So be it.</em>  <br />
What could I do but love Death for that?<br />
<em>Good luck, Memory.</em>  </p>

<p>Score: 748</p>
<p>"What about you, Toby? What do your parents do for a living?"</p>
<p>"Well, my mom goes out at eleven at night and comes back at seven full of glitter on her body. She tells me she's a 
clown at the circus! And dad has a bunch of guns and he sells this big packs of really white sugar to people who come to our house, so he's a coffee cop, I guess."</p>
<p>The teacher pressed her lips together and raised her eyebrows. "Okey!" she said, turning to Jim. "Jimmy, what 
about you?"</p>
<p>Jim thought back on his mother and father. "Well..." </p>
<p>He wanted to tell the class that his father had once been the famous superhero Power Dude. And he wanted to tell everyone that his mother had been the notorious supervillain Lady Psycho. He wanted to tell the whole class about how his father and mother fought for years all across Alpacatown, until the day their real life personas – Eric and Ellie – fell in love and got married. After marrying the love of her life, Lady Psycho never attacked the city anymore. And Power Dude decided he had better things to do with his time than dressing in spandex and chasing petty thieves.  So, a few years after Jimmy was born, they both retired their costumes, without ever finding out each other's identities.</p>
<p>Jim wanted to tell all that to the class -- but not even his parents knew that he knew about their secret identity. Let alone other people.</p>
<p>"Jimmy?"</p>
<p>Jim looked up. Mrs. Williams was smiling. "My dad's a lawyer," he said. "And my mom's an architect."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back home, Power Dude and Lady Psycho – or, as they were dressed at the moment, Eric and Ellie – were fighting 
again. While Jim ate his dinner in silence, his mother was going on and on about how Eric never listened to her. 
She was going on and on about how he was distant lately and how he wasn't the same. Eric, on the other hand, was going on and on about how Ellie only thought of herself and her needs, and never saw things his way.</p>
<p>The usual fight. Jimmy had a memory of his parents fighting a lot less, back when they still had their secret night jobs. Now it was just argument after argument, every day.</p>
<p>In a way, it was kind of better when they beat the shit out of each other in costumes -- there would be no anger left in either of them by the time they got home to their real selves.</p>
<p>Ellie got up from the dinner table, turned away and heavy-stepped towards the window. Eric crossed eyes with Jim, then looked down at his plate.</p>
<p>And then Jim had an idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You're saying there's a show and tell at school about superheroes and villains?"</p>
<p>Jim nodded at his parents. "And I wanted to take Power Dude and Lady Psycho!"</p>
<p>His parents exchanged looks. "Well, Jim… we don't know Power Dude and Lady Psycho…"</p>
<p>"Plus," his mother added, "they both retired a long time ago, Jim."</p>
<p>Jim put on his best sad face. "Yeah… I guess I'll just go with my Superman action figures…"</p>
<p>On his way to his bedroom, he glanced back at his parents. They were exchanging looks.</p>
<p><em>Excellent.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"And this is my Lex Luthor." Jim showed the action figure to the bored classroom. He looked out the window. Still 
nothing.</p>
<p>His father had told him that he had 'called' Power Dude about the show and tell, but couldn't promise anything 
about Lady Psycho. His mother hadn't said anything about it, but Jim had spotted her glancing at her supervillain 
costume hidden in her closet while she thought he was asleep.</p>
<p>"And this…" Jim continued, grabbing the Wonder Woman action figure. "Is Wonder –"</p>
<p>The window burst in a million pieces, and Power Dude's imposing figure climbed through. He stopped by Mrs. 
William's desk and, fists resting on his hip, looked around the classroom: "I understand I was called for a show and 
tell here. Who is Jim!?"</p>
<p>The classroom was ecstatic. Everyone cheered. Power Dude walked confidently to the center of the room and –</p>
<p>"So we meet again, Power Dude…"</p>
<p>The faces turned to the door. There, dressed in the black and white suit she hadn't put on in years – Lady Psycho.</p>
<p>Jim smiled.</p>
<p>"So we meet again…" Power Dude said, in a low tone. Husband and wife stepped towards one another like Clint 
Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef in a 60's spaghetti western. Somewhere in Italy, Ennio Morricone whistled.</p>
<p>Jim watched as his parents stopped eye to eye in front of the class. Lady Psycho pulled her laser gun.</p>
<p>Power Dude laughed. "That thing doesn't even work anymore!"</p>
<p>Lady Psycho turned the gun in her hand and checked something on the back. "You know what, it really doesn't. It's way past the expiration date." She looked up. "It doesn't matter! I can destroy you with my bare hands!"</p>
<p>Around the classroom, the kids started clapping and chanting: 'Fight! Fight! Fight!'</p>
<p>Mrs. William looked kind of startled. She was filming the whole thing with her phone, nonetheless. Power Dude and Lady Psycho back at work? This was huge news!</p>
<p>And then Lady Psycho threw her fist. Power Dude avoided it. He kicked, she crouched. The fight went on and on as 
they stumbled through the four corners of the room, knocking chairs and notebooks and desks all around.</p>
<p>In the end, Power Dude managed to overpower Lady Psycho, and the city was safe one more time.</p>
<p>"I'll be back, Power Dude!" Lady Psycho said, at the door. "I'll be back to conquer this city once and for all!"</p>
<p>Bruised and on the floor, but with a smile on his face, Power Dude looked up. "I'll always win, Lady Psycho! The city 
is safe with me!"</p>
<p>And then she was gone. Soon after, Power Dude followed, leaving behind the promise that he would return and the 
kids could sleep safe at night knowing their hero was back.</p>
<p>Everyone clapped. Jim got an 'A'. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night there was no fighting around the dinner table, but rather an amusing and amicable conversation about the return of the city's famous superhero and villain.</p>
<p>"I wonder if she's back for good," Eric said casually, avoiding his wife's gaze.</p>
<p>"Well... if <em>he's</em> back for good I'm guessing she is too," Ellie replied.</p>
<p>Jim got up. "Well, I'm off to bed. Good night mom, good night dad," he said, on his way to his bedroom.</p>
<p>"Good night, honey."</p>
<p>Jim pushed the door. Before closing it completely, he watched his parents caring for each other's wounds on the 
couch. He saw them smile and kiss, then turn to the TV, hands around each other's shoulder.</p>
<p>Jim closed the door, smiled and went to bed.</p>
<p>Power Dude and Lady Psycho were back.</p>

<p>"Get a move on!"</p>
<p>The butt of the rifle hit my stomach as I felt the air crash out of my lungs.  I struggled to breathe and felt myself being thrown into the center of the room.  I winced in pain, finding myself surrounded by several of the other tourists and the captain of the yacht. </p>
<p>The other sailors, however, pointed their rifles at us.  As a person who watched any action movie, I knew that they were AK47s - the perfect mass-produced gun.  They also never jammed.</p>
<p>"We're kind of fucked, aren't we?" I hissed jokingly at the woman next to me.</p>
<p>"How are you finding this funny?" she glared at me incredulously, "As an unemployed freak, maybe you should ask one of them for a job, huh?"</p>
<p>"Like I said, I'm a freelance jack-of-all-trades," I muttered, "It's not like you're doing anything with your-"</p>
<p>"Quiet down!" one of the sailors fired his rifle into the air as he ordered through a thick accent, "Shut up!"  </p>
<p>The gunshot rung throughout my ears, echoing off the walls of my head as I tried to concentrate.  As the noise subsided, I took a look at our captors.  A small group of dark-skinned sailors, my guess native Brazilians from the mainland. </p>
<p>"Man, I should've never taken that free boat trip..." I muttered.  There was an explosive pain as one of the sailors smacked his palm across my face, a burning sensation as I began to feel drowsy.  Luckily with years of being a crash-test dummy, I knocked off the trauma and stared intently at the sailor who had stepped into the middle of the cabin.</p>
<p>"You are all hostages!" the ringleader announced, "We are holding you ransom from your respective governments, each of you for $1 million."  A quiet murmur ran through the passengers as the man fired his rifle into the air again.  There were several screams as I felt plaster and dust fall onto me.  Several of the others coughed around me, but with my last job as a demolitions expert for construction, dust didn't seem to bother me anymore.</p>
<p>"Sir?"  I raised my hand tentatively, "Can I ask a question?"</p>
<p>I feared the worst, but the sailor grunted as he walked towards me.  "What is it?"</p>
<p>I remembered as I walked onto the boat earlier that day how the sailors had all been listening to the radio of a Palmeiras game, a local Division B team for Brazilian soccer.  From my experience as a second-division score tracker for various sports, I knew the team.  Combined with my lessons as an improvisation teacher, I could pull this off.</p>
<p>"<em>Meu!</em> [buddy]" I smiled, "Can you at least turn on the radio?  Palmeiras has some big transfer news coming up!"</p>
<p>The man lowered his rifle and chuckled.  "You are American, you know nothing."</p>
<p>"Meu!  Palmeiras is my favorite team!" I gave him a cheeky grin, "Can a <em>gringo</em> not enjoy the beautiful game?"</p>
<p>The two of us chuckled, but the sailor quickly raised his gun again as his face became alert.  "What is this news?"</p>
<p><em>Come on, what was his name?  What was his name?</em></p>
<p>"Ze Roberto, man!" I laughed, remembering the captain of the team, "They say he's leaving the team for Europe!"  Ze Roberto was worshiped by any supporter, and I knew that no matter how much he doubted me, the sailor would haveto check.</p>
<p>He handed his rifle to one of the others as he pulled out his radio from his pocket.  I knew I didn't have long as he continued to adjust the channel.  I eyed out of the corner of my eye and counted the guns - four of them.  Too many to make a move.  No matter how many years I spent managing a judo dojo, it would be useless.  If they suspected anything, I was dead.  It was that simple.</p>
<p>"I hear no news!"  the leader was confused as he continued to adjust the device.</p>
<p>"Here, you have to go to the main channel."  I nodded at him.  Nervously, he tossed me the radio.  I quickly switched on the open transmission-line as nobody seemed to have noticed what I had done.  Anything I said would be sent to any radio within a five-mile radius.  We were only several minutes away from land, so hopefully the port authorities could react. </p>
<p><em>Thank God for those four months as a radio tech.</em></p>
<p>"Here we go!" I muttered, "Now despite the fact that <strong>you kidnapped us, we can still listen to the Palmeiras transfer!  I'm so glad that we're trapped aboard the Anastasia!</strong>"   </p>
<p>The man looked angrily at me as he listened, but at least he didn't seem to understand my English too well to understand what I was doing.  "This is an ad for foot cream!"</p>
<p>"Do they not have advertisements in Brazil?" I scoffed nervously, showing no sign of weakness, "They will announce it in a few minutes."</p>
<p>I knew that it was a long-shot but it seemed to be working - one by one, the sailors crowded around the radio as the advertisements blared through the small cabin.  None of them seemed to notice the approaching motors and eventually footsteps on the boat several minutes later as they were absorbed in the announcement that would never come.</p>
<p>The door burst open as the sailors dropped their weapons in surprise.  Several armed men pointed their automatics at them and yelled in Portuguese.  The sailors quickly surrendered as many things were being yelled.  I mean, I couldn't understand any of it but just imagine one of those international Netflix movies, and try to imagine the subs.  Only the whole situation didn't have any subtitles.</p>
<p>After the sailors had been taken away, the rest of the passengers got up and looked at me.   There were several murmurs of thanks as I looked at the woman earlier who had consistently harassed me.</p>
<p>"I-I'm sorry," she looked down at the ground, "That's all you'll get from me."</p>
<p><em>Is she serious?</em></p>
<p>"Hold out your hand."  I smiled at her.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Hold out your hand."  I kept my intentions unknown.</p>
<p>The woman nervously held out her hand together and looked at me.  Before she could react, I took a string from my sleeve and tied her wrists in a tight knot that was nearly impossible to untie.   It was tight enough that it dug into her skin, so any scissors would be extremely painful to cut the wire.</p>
<p>"What the fuck!"  she exclaimed as she glared at me, "What was that for?"</p>
<p>"That was another 'useless' job I had," I shrugged, "I had to tie knots for a part-time when I was a teenager!"</p>

<p>June was born in August, making her a problem child from her very first minutes. Her mother used to say her very 
first words, after looking around the delivery room like a critic after an arthouse film, were: "Is this it?"</p>
<p>Which was probably not true, but still.</p>
<p>Things didn't get better when, at age nine, June's father sat her down on her bed and, behind a nicotine stained beard and a flask of whiskey he always carried with him, told her that he had made a very important discovery many years ago in his lab at UCLA.</p>
<p>"What discovery, Dad?" June had asked, a question she'd later regret like people regret pet snakes.</p>
<p>"Well, June, me and Victoria, my lab partner, we discovered this thing called the Multiverse. It means that there is 
an infinite number of universes existing at the same time, and we're just living in one of them. These universes can 
affect one another occasionally – like, people usually get sick here if a version of themselves die in another universe – but overall it's not a big deal. Well, except for the fact that it renders everything we ever knew about reality, 
existence and the importance of the self and ego useless, of course."</p>
<p>Her father left the room with a drunken smile that day. He killed himself a few years later, leaving June alone to 
deal with the fact that reality was not like everyone around her assumed. Which can mess with your head a bit, especially in teenage years.</p>
<p>And that's why June was a bit of a problem child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In school, June was something of a loner, as you'd expect from someone who knows a hidden horrible truth about the universe. She was also pretty good at Physics and surprisingly good at English, though terrible at Biology.</p>
<p>It was during a particularly boring biology class that she overheard Greg, part time quarterback, occasional idiot 
and full time crush of every stupid girl in school, talking to one of his friends from the football team in hushed 
whispers: "It's a virus, it seems," Greg was saying. "The disease is all over Europe, already. And South America. 
They don’t know what causes it, only that it makes people really, really dumb. They're calling it Keeping up with 
the Kardashians Syndrome, or KUK."</p>
<p>After the bell rang, June went by the boys without a second glance, wondering how exactly people would be able to tell if Greg had the Kuk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When June got home, she knew something was wrong immediately, and not just because Bill Purr, her cat, was 
trying to eat the ceramic apples on the coffee table – after all, Bill had always been a bit stupid.</p>
<p>No, what made June realize something was wrong was that her mother was also trying to eat the apples.</p>
<p>"Mom?" June tried, careful. Her mother looked up, the apple still hanging from between her teeth like a stuffed pig 
at a cartoon banquet. </p>
<p>"Yes, June?"</p>
<p>"You do know those are not real, right?" June asked.</p>
<p>Her mother looked down at the apple. Behind her, a newswoman on TV talked over a headline that read 'Kuk Virus 
Reaches California'.</p>
<p>"Oh, shit," June said, as Bill Purr threw himself at the wall and passed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What do you know about Kok!?" June asked, as soon as Greg opened the door to his house.</p>
<p>"Well, I think the American average is 6,2 inches, but girth is more important, some girls told –"</p>
<p>"The disease!" June walked in without being invited.</p>
<p>"Oh, you mean Kuk." Greg closed the front door and turned. "How did you find my address, by the way?"</p>
<p>"I called the school," June said. "The principal has been infected. I said I was doing an interview for the Kidnapper's 
Weekly Magazine and needed some addresses and she said OK."</p>
<p>"Shit…" Greg strolled to the couch and took a seat. "So it's really spreading…"</p>
<p>"Yeah, and I heard you talking about it before everyone else, so what's the deal?"</p>
<p>"What's it to you?" Greg asked, looking up.</p>
<p>June hesitated for two reasons: first, her father had told her never to tell anyone about the Multiverse and the fact 
that sick people on our reality meant people dying on other realities. It could cause panic. And second, because 
there was <em>no way</em> Greg Marshall would understand it even if she tried to explain.</p>
<p>"I'm… worried," June said. "My mom's infected."</p>
<p>"Yeah, so is my dad," Greg replied. From the upper floor, a male voice rang: <em>"Hey, where's my shoe?"</em></p>
<p>"So?" June insisted. "What do you know about it?"</p>
<p>Greg got up and headed towards her. "Ok, listen… my mom was a scientist, back when she was alive. I'm not smart 
like she was, so I don't really understand all of this. But she once told me something that stayed with me."</p>
<p>June waited, anxious.</p>
<p>"She gave me a… well, a sort of helmet. And she told me never to use it… unless if someday everyone but me start 
getting sick for no apparent reason. So I always follow disease news rather closely."</p>
<p>June frowned. "Greg…"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>From upstairs, a loud thud preceded Greg's father's voice: "Outch! When did wood become so solid!?"</p>
<p>"Did your mom work at UCLA?"</p>
<p>"Yeah…"</p>
<p>"Was her name Victoria?"</p>
<p>"Yeah…"</p>
<p>June looked down. Then up. "Yeah. I think I'm gonna have to see that helmet."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>From upstairs, a low rustle and crackling of fire reached them. Greg's father uttered "Woah! Fire burns curtains! Look at that!"</p>
<p>June took Greg's hand and looked up the nicest look she could; a look like she was interacting with a child who received very limited oxygenation during its early fetal period. "Because, Greg," she said, "I'm pretty sure that helmet will take us to another universe."</p>

<p>"What kind of stupid question is that? How the hell should I know what's in their freezer? Billionaires probably don't even eat Bagel Bites, you idiot."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but if I were a billionaire, I'd buy a <em>whole lot</em> of Bagel Bites."</p>
<p>"Marv, that's probably why you're not a billionaire. Now shut up, I think it's time to move. I haven't seen any movement since we got here and I know the owners are dead."</p>
<p>The Wet Bandits had parked their run-down Chevy Astro about half a mile away from the biggest, most luxurious house in the entire city and waited for night to fall before making their move.</p>
<p>"Can you believe they didn't even hire security to keep the place safe?" Harry asked, laughing. His gold tooth sparkled a little through the smile.</p>
<p>"Probably spent all the money on Bagel Bites."</p>
<p>"Ah, Jesus, shut up already. You take the back entrance, I'm gonna try and break through the front somehow. Lots of windows and doors."</p>
<p>The duo split, and Harry began to work on picking the front door's lock. Marv tip-toed around back to a stairwell that led up to a rear entrance. As he walked up to the door, a strange <em>click</em> came from the other side. When he tried to jimmy the doorknob, something surprised him- the door was unlocked. </p>
<p>"Wow, Harry! These guys are total morons! The back door was unlocked, come around!" he shouted to no avail. "Huh, probably can't hear me. Oh well, I'll just unlock the front door."</p>
<p>What he didn't know was that Harry <em>did</em> hear him, but was unable to respond because a military-grade taser had been rigged to fire when he stepped onto the doormat. Harry was convulsing on the ground, foaming slightly at the mouth, rigid as a board. </p>
<p>Marv quietly and carefully walked into the rear mudroom, then through a large hallway and toward the front entrance. It was very dark, and none of the light switches worked.</p>
<p>"Maybe they shut the power off to save energy? Man, if I was a billionaire..."</p>
<p>He was unable to finish his sentence because to his right, in the kitchen, a piping-hot platter of Bagel Bites was set up on the counter. They looked so fresh and delicious, the smell entered his nostrils and he shivered with delight. He walked toward them, completely disregarding the fact that cooked food indicated someone was home, salivating and laughing.</p>
<p>When he went to reach one, his hand passed through the plate. He swiped again and again, but his hand couldn't grab hold of anything. </p>
<p>"What the hell? Fake Bagel Bites? Is this a hologram?"</p>
<p>He stumbled forward, out of the kitchen, where an old lady was waiting for him.</p>
<p>"You will never have Bagel Bites again. If you do, I will kill you," the woman said ominously.</p>
<p>"G....grandma? But ..why? I love Bagel Bites...."</p>
<p>Immediately behind him, a tiny abomination appeared and shrieked like a banshee, leaving Marv crippled in fear and begging for his mother. He dropped to the floor, rocking back and forth, twitching and sobbing. The monster peeled it's mask off, revealing a gas mask underneath.</p>
<p>"Alfred, it's Wayne. Did the guy out front go down?" the little boy asked calmly, blanket draped over his shoulders like a cape.</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Wayne. Are you okay on your end?" the voice responded over a tiny intercomm.</p>
<p>"Yep, he's hallucinating like crazy. I can't believe that gas was so cheap yet incredibly effective."</p>
<p>"Nor I, Master Wayne. I will call the police immediately. Detective Gordon will have a laugh about this when he hears of it."</p>
<p>"Sure. Thanks for letting me mess with them a little, Alfred. I know you just wanted to call the cops but this was fun."</p>

<h1>[WP] A ghost and a zombie meet. They're from the same person.</h1>
<p>Score: 705</p>
<p>Eric shuffled along Main Street, brightly greeting the other zombies he passed along the way.</p>
<p>"Hey, guys! Apocalypse treating you well, I presume?"</p>
<p>They moaned back feebly, and Eric sighed to himself. They never got his jokes. Not surprising, of course. He was one of the few who had somehow maintained his intelligence after the infection spread, and the world had gone to shit.  It really was a curse, more than anything else. The only one like himself he'd found was a ten-year-old zombie child, who'd been beheaded by the Survivors before he could intervene. </p>
<p>"Eric? Eric," he heard a soft whisper rustle through the trees. </p>
<p>He shivered - such a human reaction. He looked around and saw the tell-tale translucent outline of a ghost leaning against a tree.</p>
<p>"Not in the mood, buddy," he muttered to it as he came closer. He couldn't make out any features except an enormous pair of eyes - milky orbs fixed on his face. "Move towards the light already, will you? God knows there's none of it on Earth anymore."</p>
<p>"Can't," it sighed the word. "I'm you, moron. We're split. And so we're incomplete, and I can't move on! Unfinished business, as they say. That's putting it mildly."</p>
<p>He stared at it, and understood. "You're <em>my</em> ghost? Bullshit. How can I still think and talk, then?"</p>
<p>"You can talk exactly because I'm a ghost!" </p>
<p>It drifted closer, shaking the vague shape that was its head. </p>
<p>"Listen to me, talking about <em>you</em>. It's why we're the way we are. Why I am. The infection didn't spread through you completely. And so we didn't die completely. Give up the remaining bit of your soul so we can move on, already! This plane is run by demons now. Assholes. They creep me out, I want to get away."</p>
<p>"And I don't?" Eric snapped to his ghost-self. If it even spoke the truth. "Zombies don't exactly make for stimulating company, let me tell you. Moaning and slurping up rotten meat, that pretty much sums them up. Go on, possess me or something. Get the last bit of ourself out."</p>
<p>"It doesn't work like that! No, you have to die again. Properly this time."</p>
<p>They bickered in the street, and Eric forgot where he was and where he'd been heading. He was still arguing when a Survivor crept up behind him with a machete, and took off his head with one clean swipe.</p>
<p>Eric's ghost stared at the head bouncing down the street with grim satisfaction. He'd seen the man coming, of course.</p>
<p>"Finally," he said, swooping after it. "Time to get this over and done with."</p>
<p>He possessed the head as it came to a standstill in a ditch. He had to move quickly to reunite with the last bit of his consciousness, which should be trying to escape from his old body right about now. He swooped into the head's bloody ear canal with a ghostly moan.</p>
<p>Eric's eyes flew open, and he took in a deep breath. Finally, heaven. He glanced around, but could only see concrete.</p>
<p>"Well, this can't be right," he told himself calmly, trying to take stock of his surroundings. </p>
<p>Was this hell, then? He peered upward, and saw the Earth's night sky glittering above. He sniffed carefully, and got a whiff of sewer water. A thrill of horror shot down his spi...no. Not his spine. He didn't have a spine. </p>
<p>"Shit," he whispered in panic. He was trapped in his head. </p>
<p>"Huuugnnghh," he heard something groan above him. The gaunt, maggot-eaten features of a zombie was just visible if he rolled his eyes up. </p>
<p>"No! No!" he screamed as it picked him up and stumbled down the street. "Hey, put me down!"</p>
<p>As it sniffed his head and moaned appreciatively, Eric sighed and closed his eyes. He waited for the inevitable moment when he'd become dinner. </p>
<p>"Hey buddy," the zombie suddenly whispered in his ear. "Sorry I reached you so late - and for pretending to be a real zombie. They're watching us. <em>They're everywhere</em>."</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes up and squinted, and finally recognised the zombie. No mistaking those tattoos, messed up and faded though they were.</p>
<p>"Zack?" he muttered, and groaned aloud. </p>
<p>How did that guy, of all people, keep a grip on his sanity? A friend of his college roommate, Zack had been just a <em>bit</em> hypervigilant. Many had informally diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic, though Zack had never been to see a therapist. </p>
<p>"Where are you taking me?" he demanded. </p>
<p>"A place only I know about," Zack hissed back. "I saw this coming <em>years</em> ago and prepared accordingly. And I think I know what to do about your little predicament. Removing and reattaching heads are a cakewalk, trust me."</p>
<p>Eric sighed as Zack babbled on. It wasn't as if things could get much worse. Hadn't he already been resigned to being eaten? What else could possibly happen?</p>
<p>"Alright, Zack. Head me in the right direction."</p>
<p>It took Zack a moment, but then he burst into hideous, hoarse peels of laughter.  </p>
<p>"Good one, man! I like your style. Keeping that sense of humour alive and kickin'. Good for you. Well, you'll need it when I administer your treatment. Boy, I can't wait! Good thing I trained for this all those years in college, huh? They never did catch me, you know. I was <em>that</em> good."</p>
<p>"Wait, what do you mean? What training? Caught you doing what, exactly?"</p>
<h2>He shouted in vain at Zack, as his former friend began humming to himself and showing no sign of hearing him.  Finally, he simply gave up and waited to see what would happen. Maybe he'd be lucky and die again as Zack 'treated' him. Third time's the charm, as the old saying went.</h2>

<p>"Any chance it'll be twins?" Maleficent mused.</p>

<p>"Here's a hint," Maleficient snapped. "If I kill you, there'll be one life force left. And it's looking tempting, brat, if I don't get the firstborn I was promised. <em>Gods</em>, what a waste of magic."</p>
<p>"I have a lawyer who owes me a favor," Faye said.</p>

<p>"Elle, Mother Maleficent is picking you up in five minutes; do you have everything?"</p>
<p>"<em>Yes</em>, Mama," the twelve-year-old said impatiently. "I told you twice already."</p>
<p>"When I picked you up, you forgot all of your dresses," Faye said, arching an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"That's because Mother was making a raven talk and I was distracted. I remembered right away when we were on the broom."</p>
<p>"<em>After</em> I took off."</p>
<p>Rapunzel--Elle--rolled her eyes. Faye was worried that this would become a habit, as she had heard from mothers of teenagers. Elle was vivacious and generally obedient, but she had seen her friends' children degenerate into sullen and insatiable slouches practically overnight.</p>
<p>Not that Elle was her daughter, Faye reminded herself.</p>
<p>"Mother Maleficent already knows you're grounded, so don't even think about trying it, young lady."</p>
<p>Elle glared. "I wasn't in danger."</p>
<p>"You could have been. Cognitive bias called outcome bias; don't use it. The fact that it turned out okay doesn't mean that hanging upside down from your broom wasn't a stupid and dangerous decision." Faye finished stirring the bubbling pale-blue cauldron. "Arm, please."</p>
<p>The girl huffed but extended her arm, and Faye carefully cut her palm until a few drops of blood fell out and into the potion. She mixed it in as Elle applied a dab of cream to her hand, the cut healing almost instantly into nonexistence.</p>
<p>Just then, Maleficent appeared in a billow of green smoke. "Ready to go, love?"</p>
<p>"Mal," Faye said, "you remember that thing we talked about earlier? I looked into them, and it's not a good idea."</p>
<p>Maleficient's nose wrinkled disdainfully. "I presumed as much. What kind of incompetent idiots were they, anyway."</p>
<p>"It's worse. There's another, a boy, maybe ten. He's--not doing well. None of them are."</p>
<p>"I have a brother?" Elle shrieked, and both witches jumped.</p>
<p>"Um," Faye said.</p>
<p>"Smooth, Faye." Maleficent turned to the shocked twelve-year-old. "Elle-girl, your mama and I need to discuss this some more, and we need to, um, <em>talk</em> with your biological parents before we go any further with this."</p>
<p>"Can we rescue him, Mama, can we, please, please?" Elle begged, ignoring Maleficent. "I can teach him how to make potions and fly on a broomstick and talk to cats! And they were mean, those people you made me see once, we can't just leave him there! He's already been there fore ten years!"</p>
<p>Faye sighed. "We'll talk about it, darling. Your mother and I are very aware of his situation, and we don't want to leave him there any more than you do."</p>
<p>"I'll be good forever, I promise," Elle said.</p>
<p>"No," Maleficent said sharply. When Elle's head snapped around, shocked, she added quickly, "You should always be good, but we're not going to leave your brother there just because you decided to trample the deadly nightshade in my garden. We're not going to put life-and-death decisions on your shoulders, Elle-girl. That's far too much weight for you right now."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mother," Elle said obediently, although it was obvious that she was just being agreeable in an attempt to win over the witches.</p>

"Joe?" the guy next to me, Bill, asked. "Is that you?"<br />

I thought back to that night, remembering the ordeals I had been through. However, my thoughts were interrupted when some guy in a blue puffy suit burst in.<br />
"Fair Maiden!" he yelled, and everyone turned to look, first at him and then at me. The laughing resumed. "I have come to claim your hand in marriage!" This was the fifth prince that had asked for my hand in marriage.

I punched him in the face. These princes weren't all that tough.<br />
The bartender brought out my beer, and I chugged it. Then I got up to leave. I didn't really care to hang around people much; the people who were okay with me were the ones I hated, and the people I put up with hated me. I walked out the door, being sure to stomp on the prince's face on my way out.<br />
There was only one good thing that I had found about the curse. I sang a heavy metal song, one of my favorites, and my ride walked up. Everyone in the bar watched as I rode away on a live grizzly bear.</p>

He pulled a washcloth from his jacket pocket and a bottle of water from a different one. He poured the water on the towel and began washing the man's feet. The homeless man didn't react, probably in a drug-induced haze, Thorn realized. "You aren't sidekicks in this phase. You're students."  </p>

<p>My listless corpse slammed to the ground in a bloody splatter, the tangled mess of vivified branches that had embraced me finally releasing its grasp and returning to the position it had held before I'd engaged it.</p>
<p>This was my seven-hundred-fifty-second attempt at this new half-life in Hell. All it seemed to consist of was this horrid array of nightmarish ghouls in a sprawling landscape of various forms; tree demons in a wooded thicket, hydra in a placid pond, draconic monsters atop castle battlements. It didn't really matter which direction I decided to push myself. Death rushed to meet me around nearly every corner.</p>
<p>The first time was alarming, I admit. Ascending a staircase in the decaying ruins of what might have been a church or a theater just after my condemnation, I had run into a half-man, half-goat behemoth that crushed me underfoot almost before I'd noticed it was there. I found myself wondering briefly, as my life-force ebbed, what happened when one died in what was supposed to be the punishment of the already-dead. It didn't take long to find out -- I just ended up alive again, back where I'd first awoken in this hellscape.</p>
<p>Every death, the same thing: finding myself reviving at whatever place I had most recently camped out. The fires I lit seemed to always beckon me back when I felt my vitality suddenly cease.</p>
<p>This Hell seemed hopeless.</p>
<p>That was, at least, until the Savior arrived.</p>
<p>His entrance to Hell was foretold by glowing white runes on the ground near one of these horrible beasts. I cautiously approached it, certain it was a trap, like some of the notes on the ground that read "Jump here" but only led to an infinite chasm. To my surprise, when I touched the sign, a burly tower of a man with an enormous shield and a six-foot sword slowly faded into existence in front of me. Startled, I fell backwards to the ground, barely catching myself before cracking my skull. I didn't know his intent, so I scuttled away awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, dude. I'm here to help. God sent me."</p>
<p>I shook my head, confused, as the man approached me. Expecting the worst, I grimaced in anticipation of the blade surely about to bisect me.</p>
<p>Instead, he reached out a hand to help me up. "The name is Havelbuster. I apparently died this week because I forgot to eat. Dark Souls III just came out and I was going HAM as fuck. I guess God figured you guys needed some help down here, so... here I am."</p>
<p>My dread subsiding, I explained to him the Lovecraftian creature residing behind the wall of fog just down the hall.</p>
<p>Havelbuster strode confidently down the steps and pushed his way through the pea soup. I followed, certainly not half as confidently, but managed not to curl in fright as the horrid eight-limbed abomination roared its challenge.</p>
<p>The armored warrior charged without hesitation, immediately beginning to hack away at one of the tentacles flailing toward him. Rolling to avoid another tentacle's graceless swipe, Havelbuster's sword traced an arc that cleanly lopped off a good portion of the sucker-covered arm.</p>
<p>At that point, unfortunately, things went sideways.</p>
<p>Feeling emboldened by my metal-clad savior, I threw myself into the fray as well, forgetting that I had absolutely no armor, no weapon, and no skill with which to go toe-to-toe with this hideous mountain of flesh. It only mattered for a moment, though, because I took a blow to the chest with a barbed tentacle tip that pierced directly through my heart on its way out through my spine.</p>
<p>Paralyzed, bleeding not quite profusely by only the grace of the barb embedded within me, I tried to call to the shieldbearer weakly, sure that my voice wouldn't carry. He must have heard, though, because he turned, sweeping his edge through another whiplike extremity, and sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"We will now be opening for questions," the gooey grey alien in the suit said, turning to the audience.</p>
<p>Behind him, Mark Wilson smiled. He risked a glance at himself in the mirror in the back of the conference room – his silhouette against the white light of the power point presentation onscreen behind him was lean and tall, like a very successful turkey breast roll. He pointed at an alien with its hands up on the front row.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wilson, could you repeat the part about the gravity and the space travel? I mean, I understand you guys 
conquered your own moon, but how!?"</p>
<p>Mark smiled at the alien. A very faint roar reached his ears from up above, but he ignored it for the time being. 
"Like I said, the biggest part of it is getting the ship out of the atmosphere. We burn fuel to do that, so we can –"</p>
<p>"Fuel?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's dinosaur juice that's been sitting under the Earth for millions of years."</p>
<p>The aliens exchanged impressed looks. "What about breathing in space?"</p>
<p>"Well, unlike most species in the galaxy, earthlings can only survive inside the atmosphere of their own planet. So 
we had to develop a suit that could maintain pressure and oxygen levels stable in our bodies."</p>
<p>Another murmur ran through the room. Mark held on to his smile.</p>
<p>The roaring sound grew louder, but still Mark ignored it. <em>Not yet.</em></p>
<p>Everything amazed the aliens. It was so easy. He had given motivational speeches on Earth before, but damn if interspace motivation wasn't so much better. You could do an hour on not giving up on your dreams using the invention of the toaster oven as a central theme. The first pizza and the importance of indulgence. Roller blades and how acknowledging the futility of life can lead to a better you.</p>
<p>Really. The aliens didn't have gravity. Or atmosphere. Or wars. Or pretty much anything to deal with. They conquered space travel the day they learned how to jump. Their bodies didn't need food or sunlight or water to survive.</p>
<p>Those guys… the space equivalent of spoiled little brats. Eager to learn as much as they could about the burden of 
mankind – or, in other words:</p>
<p>"How the hell did you guys find time and energy to accomplish so much?"</p>
<p>"Well," Mark said, pacing from one side of the stage to another. "We set goals and we work towards them."</p>
<p>"Goals?"</p>
<p>"Yes, like landing on the moon. Curing smallpox. Ending world hunger."</p>
<p>More hands shot to the air. Mark pointed at one at random. "And what are mankind's plans for the future?"</p>
<p>The roaring was now loud enough that few could keep ignoring it. Half the aliens had their heads still turned to 
Mark, half were looking around searching for the source.</p>
<p>"Well, that's the funny thing," Mark said, stopping at the center of the stage. "You guys never had to develop any 
technology. You didn't need energy or food, so you never learned to hunt or to build dams. You don't have 
predators, so why build shelter? You don't even have gravity, so you never bothered to develop any kind of sophisticated interstellar transportation. You just sort of live here in your little planet, rent free, no trouble. A utopia of happiness."</p>
<p>The aliens nodded in agreement, more and more looking around for the source of the roaring sound.</p>
<p>"Well… we're humans," Mark continued. "We're the scum of the universe. But don't blame it on us – we've been 
dealt a shitty hand. So, to make up for it, we've developed all this technology you guys just amazed yourselves with…"</p>
<p>The ceiling blew away, revealing the ships hovering menacingly over the aliens' heads. Bright lights flooded the room, and the faces of human soldiers emerged from black holes in the base of the ships.</p>
<p>"… and now we're using that technology to bomb your planet back to the Stone Age, which technically you never 
left," Mark finished. "So we can steal <em>your</em> dinosaur juice."</p>
<p>The aliens all exchanged looks, confused. Scared. Mark signaled for the ships to fire.</p>
<p>"We're humans," Mark said, as the laser beam shot down from the mother ship. "And we're bad as shit."</p>

<p>Hours passed until he heard the distinct "DING" from his email received notification.</p>

New email titled: "Would you like to change the difficulty? Current Setting: Very Hard"</p>
<p>Connor stared at his screen...and clicked into the email.
The body read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hello Connor08011996,</p>
<p>I have noticed that you are having a very rough time working with the difficulty settings that your parents set for &gt;you at birth.  Not everyone gets to use console for the setup of their child and Very Hard is not a setting that is &gt;recommended unless they start off with a LOT of help; help you did not get.</p>
<p>Now...I'm not admitting any liability/fault here, but I'm offering you several options to make your experience in &gt;the beta a little more enjoyable.</p>
<p>You may only choose ONE of the following options: When you use one, the others will deactivate.
Before you fall asleep, think of the time that you stole that toy at Mr. O'Flanahan's toy store when your family &gt;went to Niagara Falls.  Specifically think of how you told your mother that "it was a gift from the owner for being &gt;such a good boy".
You will be prompted for which option:</p>
<p>1.) Console (Cheat Engine) -  Say "Cheater"</p>
<p>You'll fall asleep and go into settings.  Now I've preconfigured access so that you can get THREE uses of console, &gt;so make good use of each session.</p>
<p>Onto the cheats.
You'll be able to give yourself more money (up to $250,000 USD each session), alter your appearance, take a &gt;boost to your stats (I've given you 50 points that you can distribute), change your relationship stats with others &gt;(once per session), and save/load your progress (Only 1 save/load per session).</p>
<p>Normally, you get no achievements for using this...but I'll let it slide for you.  </p>
<p>2.) Difficulty Change: Say "Difficulty Change"
You will appear in a room with Six different blocks.
1 through 6.  </p>
<p>1 represents VERY EASY</p>
<p>2 represents EASY</p>
<p>3 represents NORMAL (Default)</p>
<p>4 represents HARD (All tasks +100% difficulty)</p>
<p>5 represents VERY HARD (All tasks +300% difficulty)</p>
<p>6 represents DEBUG (All tasks effectively impossible, please do not choose)</p>
<p>Choose your new difficulty by punching through the block of your choice.<br />
You will wake up, and resume.  No penalty for doing this...thought you will not get any of the possible rewards for &gt;completing your existing quests.</p>
<p>3.) Restart: Say "Restart"
Nothing fancy here, you get a complete redo.<br />
Same difficulty, but you will have retain all knowledge up to this decision.
You regain all skills at the age of 5...so you will have a few years where you get to relearn motor skills and things &gt;like using your vocal chords.  </p>
<p>Hope this helps.
I'm cheering for you kid.</p>
<p>Yours Truly,
JC (Creator, Admin)"</p>

<p>A man, a strange <em>man</em> tells Richard to stop breaking the fourth wall like he is on TV. It makes for an unbelievable story that breaks a reader's suspension of disbelief.  </p>
<p>"What suspension of disbelief," Richard asks no one in particular. "It's a fantasy for Christ's sake."  </p>
<p>The adventurer mumbles to himself while making his way through the woods. Soon, Richard begins to realize the error in his ways, and resumes his search for the Dragon's key.  </p>
<p>"No."  </p>
<p>It's the story, Richard. Just go with it.  </p>
<p>"I refuse."  </p>
<p>Don't be difficult, we have a plot to get back on. Richard pushes a branch out of the way---  </p>

<p>Stop that, this is supposed to be a kid's story!  </p>
<p>"Fuck you, I want out."  </p>
<p>Richard pleaded to the silent woods for mercy, but only the leaves rustling in the wind responded to his desperate cry. The weight of this quest sat heavily in his chest, with no companion to share this burden with.  </p>
<p>"You killed him off in the second chapter."  </p>
<p>The adventurer sat on a fallen tree, bemoaning---  </p>
<p>"Yuck, it's got moss all over it."  </p>

<p>Richard <em>stood</em>, with resolve in his heart, to finish this quest.  </p>

<p>"No, I'm getting a drink." But Richard wasn't serious.  </p>

<p>Little did Richard remember of the previous two books, of his many heroic deeds and noble tasks, which catered to his audience, who's age happened to range from <em>10 to 14!</em>  </p>

<p>Too late, an endless wood ventured out to impossible distances in every direction the adventurer could see. Sorry.  </p>

<p>Two men sat in the tavern of Telver Town enjoying two pints of non-alcoholic beverages, preparing to continue their journey.  </p>
<p>"So then," the first man said. "I scaled up the cliff for two days, with nothing but a piece of string and a backpack to sustain me!"    </p>
<p>Richard did not reply to Frederick the Lesser's boasting. Instead, he took another sip, smiling at the stories Fred shared of his impossible survival that led to their reunion. </p>

These skills are what make you our greatest assets, but also our greatest weaknesses. You know our secrets, know our plans, and you know who our other agents are. You have of course been trained to resist torture, but these Hedonians utilise something worse than you can imagine.”</p>
<p>“Worse than Algosian thumb-screws?” asked one burly lad from the back of the room.</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>“Worse than an Ouduni nipple clamp?” asked a femme-fatal in the front row.</p>
<p>“Without a doubt,” I nodded grimly. “These people… well let me give you a demonstration. Any volunteers?”</p>
<p>The room was silent as the students looked around at each other. They had all experienced various forms of torture in their training, but that didn’t mean they wanted to go through any more. Finally the man built like a brick wall from the back of the room stood up.</p>
<p>“I will, I can take anything,” he spoke. They were always so sure.</p>
<p>“Very well, come up to the front,” the man came to the front. “Please take a seat.”
The man sat down in the chair, pointed away from me and facing the rest of his comrades. I slowly placed my hands on the man’s neck, my fingers hard as leather began to slightly squeeze. I moved down to his shoulders and began to give him a thorough massage.</p>
<p>“Massage is only one of the tricks these Hedonians use to get information from our agents,” I said, as I moved down to his lower back.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Is this it?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not as well trained as a Hedonian masseuse, but I think I can get something out of you.” I spoke, squeezing the knots out of his back.</p>
<p>“It’s just a massage guys, this is nothing,” he said to his comrades, a hint of humour in his voice.</p>
<p>“But doesn’t it feel good?”</p>
<p>“Well yeah, but…”</p>
<p>“Shh, don’t talk. Just relax,” I said and began working his spine. It was like hypnotism, you had to get them into the right pleasured state of mind.</p>
<p>“So, I hear the Ekklesian fleet is sending a force of twenty triremes to Hedonia this campaigning season.” I said. Gossip was a key interrogation technique for the Hedonians.</p>
<p>“No, that’s just a distraction tactic. We plan on invading the Aogan Isles in the Summer,” the man spoke freely, mystified by my massage.</p>

<p>Tim looked surprised. "I am sure this is a distraction to our quest" he said, as he stuffed a handful of cheetos into his mouth, "but if you are both insistent..."</p>

<p>"Oh come on, that was funny!" Hans complains, before teleporting to the kitchen to get himself breakfast. Sighing, I crawl out of bed and slump to the floor, staring longingly at the door. I hear Hans turn on the TV to a random news channel, which is probably describing his latest exploits. The Wily Warper! Not even a good superhero name.</p>
<p>By the time I've got myself breakfast and sat down in the living room, Hans has started his "exercises". Basically, he's jumping around the room, occasionally poking me, to hone his teleportation skills. Meanwhile, the TV is still describing how he managed to save over a hundred people from a collapsing building while Wormface, another of the city's superheroes, hunted down the perpetrators. Thankfully, despite having several superheroes, the city's never had a supervillain. </p>
<p>The media say that that's because Wormface, the Wily Warper, Laura the Destrauya, and Superbman scare them off, mentioning that one time a supervillain tried to come but had his tank blown up before he got here. I disagree. Which is, among my friends an unpopular opinion to have. You see, not only do I live with the Wily Warper, I also study the same course as Wormface, know Laura the Destrauya from school, and became friends with Superbman after I stopped him getting run over. Superbman's never been the best at understanding traffic.</p>
<p>So when my friends aren't mocking me for not having any powers, they'll keep asking why I'm such a conspiracy theorist with all my cooky theories for why supervillains don't come. I really shouldn't have ever started telling them that's what I thought, or I could have just agreed with everyone else. But I'm stubborn, you know? Surprisingly stubborn.</p>
<p>I'm brought out of my moody thoughts by a change in the news, the bank's being robbed by some idiots with guns. Like, seriously, there are superheroes in this city. Anyway, Joel immediately starts putting on his suit. Likewise, I put on my hoodie. As he prepares to teleport I walk over to him and touch his elbow, bringing me with him as he appears outside the bank.</p>
<p>A crowd is pushing out of the bank, there are gunshots, I pretend to be a scared civilian and get ready for something even more exhausting than last night. Didn't need direct control that time.</p>
<p><em>I should probably just teleport in there and start punching people,</em> Hans thinks to himself. The idiot. <em>Or, or maybe I could teleport over to Superbman and get him to do the punching.</em> That's better, but still not good enough. I checked, and the people in the bank have three trained gunmen.</p>
<p><strong>PUNCH!</strong> Superbman thinks, or maybe he screams, hard to tell at this point, as he sprints into the bank. <em>Must get more help,</em> Hans decides, swiftly teleporting off to Laura and Wormface and bringing them into the back of the bank. </p>
<p><em>I'll drop each one off behind one of those scarier looking gunmen.</em></p>
<p><strong>PUNCH!</strong></p>

I looked towards her face which was bruised, red, and raw, but smiling wide. </p>
<p>"Baby!" She ousted, through a happily, choked-up voice. 
I couldn't say anything, so I smiled. 
"Now," started the nurse, "I'll leave you two alone. But remember, she's had quite the head injury so be careful, no excessive movements."</p>
<p>With the nurse now gone, I dreaded this confrontation and began to feel anxious. </p>
<p>"I was so scared, Justin," she said, "thank God you're here!" She opened her arms up and I reluctantly hugged her. Despite smelling like like a retirement home, I still caught whiff of her scent.</p>
<p>I had always smelled this particular scent when we'd spoon. It was strong in her hair and I used to nuzzle my face right up into it and kiss her on the back of the head. </p>
<p>After her arms let me go, she grasped my hand with hers and squeezed it tightly. I squeezed back. </p>
<p>"When I woke up, all I could think of was last week when we went to the pier and what you had said to me... I was in awful pain and demanded that they'd call you immediately."</p>
<p>The pier had been two years ago. We went on a Sunday morning, hoping the crowd would be smaller at the end of the weekend. We were wrong. The weather was perfect: the sun warmed everything it touched with only a few clouds above, all of which were seemingly only there to complement the blue sky. The place was packed so we decided to explore the beach beneath the pier. </p>
<p>Another nurse came into the room and spoke up, "just checking her vitals real quick." And she did as such. I sat there silently holding Rebecca's hand, staring directly into her eyes. The nurse, after a few minutes, left. Again, in that same, happy, choked-up voice, she said, "I'm so happy you're here right now. I can't believe I almost died today... You must have been so worried."</p>
<p>"I... I was," I said, almost as choked-up as her. 
"I promise you I'll be more careful driving from now on..." tears filled her eyes.
"It's okay, sweetie," I said, leaning over the bed to give her another hug. She wrapped her arms around me more tightly than she had ever before - amazing strength for someone who had been in an accident only a few hours ago.
"I love you, Justin. I always will. Forever." She squeezed even tighter. </p>
<p>That day under the pier, I sat up in the sand with Rebecca wrapped in my arms. We had been there for hours talking and watching the waves continuously blanket the sand and then retreat back into the sea. The sun, now bright orange, began disappearing behind the blue horizon. "I never want this to end," I said. 
"Me neither," she replied, "this sunset is perfect." 
"Well, that AND you, but I think you've got it beat." 
She turned around and kissed me as the sun finally vanished entirely, leaving only a red streak upon the sky.</p>
<p>"Rebecca," I looked into her eyes.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" </p>
<h2>"I love you. I always will. Forever."</h2>

<p>The news droned in the background as I looked at Elizabeth, who didn't seem to be phased by the whole thing.  </p>
<p>"You know, honey," she pointed towards the screen, "I think I might know that lady."</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, she used to bring cats to my vet all the time," she muttered and thought for a moment, "Yeah, that has to be her..."  Her voiced wandered off as our dog skipped into the living room, his tongue hanging out of his mouth.  He gave me a cheeky smile as I signaled for him to sit on my lap.</p>
<p>"Good boy, Odie!" I laughed as he jumped onto me and began to lick my face, "Calm down, I'll get your dinner soon!"</p>
<p>"Speaking of dinner, Jon," Liz suddenly looked alert, "Where's the cat?"</p>
<p>"Oh, him?"  I laughed as Odie jumped back onto the floor and started to chase his tail, "I'm sure he's fine."</p>
<p>"You should know where he is," Liz pointed out, "With everything that's been happening... you never know if he's turned into... into one of <em>them</em>."</p>
<p>"He's a lazy cat," I reassured as I wrapped my arm around her, "He's probably sleeping somewhere around the house."</p>
<p>"If you say so."  She didn't look entirely convinced.  </p>
<p>My stomach grumbled moments later as Liz laughed at me.  I blushed cheekily and pointed towards the kitchen.  "Don't get up," I smiled, "There's some leftover lasagna in the fridge.  I'll just reheat it." </p>
<p>"We had lasagna?"  she looked surprised but went back to the news, "Do whatever you want, Jon."</p>
<p>I chuckled nervously as I headed into the kitchen.  Odie was now sitting next to Liz as both of them seemed glued to the television.  I opened the fridge door as a cool blast of air hit my face.  I took a deep breath as I grabbed the plate of lasagna  and slowly walked out the kitchen door.  My backward was a mess, perhaps as a result of the dragons that had been flying around everywhere.  I carefully stepped through the leaves as I approached the tool shed.  I had built it myself for protection against the dragons, but recently it had served another purpose.  As I stood in front of the door, the sign glaring at me: </p>
<p><strong>Jon Arbuckle's Shed!  DO NOT ENTER!</strong>.</p>
<p>Liz had never entered it for she found no need to.  I quietly knocked on the door and creaked open the door.  "Hey, you in there?" I called, "I brought you lasagna..."</p>
<p>The door slammed shut behind me as a giant mass of orange with black stripes greeted me.  Through his scales and spines on his back, he opened in mouth in hunger, drool slowly dripping onto the floor.  He straightened to full height as I looked up at what was my former feline companion.  The dragon's head hit the ceiling and shook the shed, knocking me to the ground.</p>
<p>"Garfield, I swear to God!" I hissed as I picked myself up, "You're going to get caught!"</p>
<p>I tossed him the plate.  The dragon slowly sniffed the plate and swallowed it in a second. </p>
<p>"Cat or not," I took the plate, "Nothing's changed about you, Garfield." </p>
<p>"Actually, Mondays aren't so bad anymore Jon," he shrugged his wings at me.</p>
<p>I paid him no attention as I walked out of the shed.</p>

"You're kidding. Just for a favor this small?"<br />
"Bud, don't bullshit me. You came to me because you can't do the favor yourself."  <br />
"That's not why I---"<br />
"<em>And</em> because it can't be passed down any further. I'm the one on the end of the chain aren't I?"<br />

"Yes."  <br />
"$600. Pay up, or do it yourself."<br />
"Damnit, fine, here! You take card right?"<br />
"Yeah. Slide it there. Good, the payment's been accepted. Now tell me, what's the favor?"  </p>
<hr />
<p>It's always the same with the small-time volunteers. They take more than they can chew. The favor chokes on them like a bad meal. A sticky glob. Can't sink their teeth deep enough to break the favors down into small, manageable sizes. The newer volunteers get too greedy for their own good.  </p>
<p>So they come to me. And I always charge interest.  </p>
<p>Never easy getting a favor off your back. Can't just, reimburse someone and give it back to them. Favors don't work like coupons. Someone asks you to do something, you either do it or pay for a volunteer's services. The bigger the favor, the more times it can travel down the chain.

<p>You see, I'm special. The weight of a favor never begins to crush on me as a deadline comes. And when it comes, I'm already prepared. Understand that a person of my position is never asked to <em>complete</em> the favor. The small-time volunteers, the fresh faces, the overworked ones who have a favor they forgot about... they just want it gone.  </p>
<p>So they come to me.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Sophia,</p>
<p>Sorry Frederick was unable to drive you out to Seattle for Mother's day like you asked him. He already bought a ticket to Florida to see his own, so he asked a volunteer, who asked a volunteer, who asked a volunteer, who approached me to do this favor for you.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've also bought a ticket to see my mother that day, who lives in Arkansas on her lonesome. Maybe you should have planned out your weekend. I'd reevaluate how you go about setting aside time for your parents and making the commitment to set plans yourself that don't rely on a man abandoning their mother on Mother's day.  </p>
<p>Sincerely,  </p>

<p>Such is my craft.  </p>
<p>There are few of me, and many of them. Most would break under the favor and do <em>everything</em> to finish it. But again, people don't come to me to see the favor done. They just want it off their backs. So I always charge interest.</p>
<p>I am an expert of the evasion. An artisan of the alibi. The weight of a favor can only slide off a person under a <em>very</em> particular path. A path that takes a unique set of skills to create under a short amount of time.   </p>

<p>"Chriiiiis!" Dillon bellowed. I entered the living room to see the blonde moron in his Power Guy uniform, lifting the coffee table, sofa and plasma screen TV. 
"What?" I asked, annoyed. I'd spent all night working on my lesson plan for my first day teaching at Key Academy and had little time for his bullshit. Everyone in Altion City knew Power Guy, and how could they not? With super strength, laser vision, flight and invincibility to almost everything, Dillon was their idol; voted second most powerful superhero. In college he'd often take a rain check and fly off to fight some monster from space or a giant mole creature, while I took his notes for him. Now, I was the only one getting a job, while Super Idiot did jack shit. Now, he was going to wreck <em>my</em> stuff, stuff that I'd paid for, all for some joke. </p>
<p>"Bro, Centaurette is hosting this party tonight at Nighthawk's mansion, you want to-" Dillon began before his stack of furniture began to fall. I sighed, imagining the flow of time to slow, first to a crawl and then to a complete stop. Everything froze in place while I moved the furniture back to the way they were before Dillon messed with them. As usual, they drifted through the air like balloons when I moved them. I sighed and restarted time, the familiar light blue filter fading back to normal color as time started up again.   </p>
<p>"-go?" Dillon finished, blinking. "Where'd my lifting stack go?" I took a weary sip of my coffee and shrugged. 
"I dunno, maybe a speedster got to it. Anyway, I'm not going, job starts on Monday." i said, turning to head back into my room. Dillon nodded and put on his domino mask before heading to the window. 
"Suit yourself my unpowered companion!" he crowed before rocketing off into the sky. I watched him go before heading back to my room to resume working. The thing about being the first most powerful superhero on Earth is having a good cover. And being the Unpowered roomie of the second most powerful metahuman on Earth is a perfect cover. No special name, no costume, just a man. And I like it that way. </p>

<p>El sucked at the lip of an empty Corona, studying her reflection in the sun-bright screen. </p>
<p>No makeup. Too-fat mouth. Short hair still manic from the pillow where she'd sheltered, feigning sleep, while Jackie texted with her ex. She'd considered calling her out, raising hell, hurling invective and glassware until the girl fled, but even a cheating partner was better than nothing. She'd let the tryst continue.</p>
<p>Her focus flickered back to the email. </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty level?</strong></p>
<p>The sender field was blank, as usual. Whoever kept sending these, week after week, must have scheduled them out for months in advance. She moved it to the Spam folder, only to see another message take its place.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty level?</strong></p>
<p>El shook the Corona. Nothing left. She could see the empty fridge in her mind. Nothing but condiments and molding bread and Jackie's homemade (putrid) sun tea. She tilted the bottle back and felt the last drop flatten, warm, on her tongue. </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty level?</strong></p>
<p>Home row. Index on 'J.' Her fingertips hovered. Hammered. Replied.</p>

<p>She might not have beer or love or work or hope, but her snark was intact. That was something. Right?</p>
<p>A new, bolded subject line. </p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty level? This will not affect your achievements.</strong></p>
<p><em>Sure. Let's change it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Please choose a new difficulty level.</strong></p>
<p><em>What are my options?</em></p>
<p><strong>Current setting: very hard. Options: easy, average, hard, very hard, impossible</strong></p>
<p>El considered. </p>
<p>"Easy" could mean a lot of things. A story mode game with a heart-breaking narrative. An uninterrupted foray into fantasy. But it could also mean slogging through worlds robbed of challenge. A smothering softness. Life with no edge.</p>
<p>She looked toward the bed, at the rumple of sheets on Jackie's side, at the bottle of Corona sitting empty, at the contortion of lime collapsed in its neck, at the credit card statements that fanned from the table. Would an easier life be better? Would less stress mean more happiness?</p>
<p><em>What would you choose?</em></p>
<p>The inbox sat quiet.</p>
<p>El sighed, stood. Hooked the neck of the bottle between her fingers and walked it back to the kitchen sink. The recycling was full, piled high with useless catalogs. Beneath the first two: a ticket stub. Something artsy. A date. Jackie-- overconfident--barely even trying to hide the affair. </p>
<p>The inbox pinged.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to change the difficulty level?</strong></p>
<p>She took the recycling to the curb. Made the bed. Stacked the bills.</p>
<p>Tomorrow--Sunday--she'd ask Jackie to leave. She had unemployment coming. Enough, maybe, to make the rent on her own. And if not, there were other rentals. Other women. Other ways.</p>

<p>As I spun the little wheel on my locker, the entire hallway shook. For just a moment, I was worried: was that me? I'd gotten pretty good about controlling my strength, but I still had the occasional accident. Other students glanced around, no doubt also wondering what it was. Maybe an earthquake? Then a ferocious howl echoed through the school, and I heard the distant sound of a wall crumbling. It was <em>Banshee</em>. </p>
<p>Next to me, my friend Matt paused with his biology book still in his hand. His eyes were wide with fright. <em>I</em> could easily take down the Banshee, but I was no ordinary student like him. Secretly, I was also Rex, superpowered guardian of the city. I just needed somewhere I could put on the mask and take off my clothes in privacy. </p>
<p>"I have to go to the bathroom!" I shouted.... just as Matt shouted the exact same thing. Damn! Of all times, why would he need to go <em>now</em>? He should be running! Another howl echoed through the hall, and the other students began to flee in all directions. Some were stupidly running <em>toward</em> the noise. Just more people I'd have to save.</p>
<p>"Ok... I'll just go to the one upstairs." I couldn't go to the same one as Matt; he'd see me change. Before he could say another word (or question why I wouldn't go use the one right around the corner) I dashed down the staircase to the third floor bathrooms. </p>
<p>"Oh, come <em>on</em>!" There was already a line of seven or eight other students waiting in front of the door, each one stamping their foot impatiently and casting worried glances. Outside, I could hear the Banshee's roars and the sounds of more walls coming down. I didn't have time for this crap! Why does the whole school suddenly need to take a leak?</p>
<p>Instead, I bolted to the nearest classroom. It was lunch, so it would be empty, right? Locked, but empty. I twisted the doorknob, applying just enough strength to shatter the lock into pieces. </p>
<p>"HEY!" Before I could even open the door all the way, I caught a glimpse of someone else inside, half-naked and wearing a pretty convincing replica of The Crusader's mask. What the hell? This person should be evacuating the building, not stripping down in the classroom and pretending to be a superhero. I needed this room, damn it! What is wrong with this school??</p>
<p>Fuck it. With a quick glance around to make sure no one was watching, I broke through the wall and went flying through the hole outside, putting on my mask amidst the rubble and dust. Just as swiftly, I tore off my backpack and clothes revealing my costume underneath. All of my stuff rained down onto the patch of grass below, along with most of the wall. It would be a bit hard to explain how everything got there, but I'd worry about that <em>after</em> Banshee was defeated. </p>
<p>I swooped over the buildings and into the school courtyard... only to find Banshee on the ground already. I counted <em>twenty three</em> of the city's heroes there already. There was Ms. Marvelous, standing between Capt. Lightning and Argonaut. <em>How the hell had they responded so quickly??</em> Before I even landed on the pavement next to them, four more heroes came running into the courtyard. </p>
<p>By the time the police arrived to haul the Banshee off, there were fifty two of us just sitting around chatting, with more arriving every minute. I made the rounds, shook hands, then took off to find all of my clothes and everything still in the bushes in front of the school. Before anyone knew what had happened, I was right back at my locker.</p>
<p>"You hear about the Banshee?" Matt asked from behind me.</p>
<p>I nodded. "Yeah... I, uh... saw the cops carrying him away. Crazy, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Matt responded. "And the weird thing: some of the other heroes... err, other <em>students</em>, I mean, were saying that he was trying to get the school's <em>mascot</em>!"</p>
<p>"Weird." I gave a laugh. "You think those assholes over at Kennedy High put him up to it?" Referring, of course, to our rival school. Homecoming was just a few weeks away, and they're really the only ones with the motive to go after our mascot.</p>
<p>"Ha, maybe." Matt went to open his own locker.</p>
<p>"Hey, maybe Banshee's a <em>student</em> there!" I joked. "They are pretty evil, after all!"</p>
<h2>Matt was silent; he suddenly seemed troubled. "No... that's... that's crazy. Couldn't be."</h2>

<p>“We do not count the individuals. We are all one.” Another unsatisfying answer for the humans but that is what they get for applying their logic to my species. They had been asking questions non-stop since I had arrived. It has been best to communicate through their electronics since a casual look at their history has shown them to be violent and unpredictable. </p>
<p>“But how do you have competing…” The humans question had been cut short. The crowd inside the transmission station had pushed him away. I had informed them they may ask any question but I would not answer them all. At first they simply shouted their questions over one another. They broadcast videos, radio, screamed into phone lines, spammed message boards. Anything to get their questions in electronic form hoping their question would be next.</p>
<p>“Do crabs think fish can fly?” The high pitched voice of the next human rang out in the nearly hollow space craft. </p>
<p>“No, crabs do not possess the capacity for abstract thinking.”</p>
<p>“Do any other species have abstract thinking?”</p>
<p>This human was lucky, she actually got a second question in. “None that are currently alive.” The human was ushered off stage as the answer rang out. Each person was allowed twenty seconds ask their question, a system that was put in place after the first month of chaos. The line of people waiting their turn was months long at this point. </p>
<p>“Does god have a plan for me?” Said a small voice. I gazed back at the video feed of the human asking this question, a young woman wearing a small gold cross.
“I cannot answer that.” No questions about the creator, that was the one rule. It did not stop them from trying. </p>
<p>An old man with thin rimmed glasses was next up. “Is it possible to travel faster than the speed of light?” I enjoyed the questions from the scientific community the most. They received the most thorough answers.</p>
<p>“You cannot move faster than light, but you may arrive at a location is less time than it takes light to travel there.” </p>
<p>“So worm hole travel is real?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>A small boy, no more than twelve year old stepped up next. I despised children and their asinine questions but if this is how the human wanted to waste my time then so be it. </p>
<p>“A-are you the smartest b-being?” He squeaked, stammering out his question. 
“No” I leaned back and stared at the metallic roof of my craft. </p>
<p>“So could you make a math problem so hard that you could not solve it?”
That question sounded vaguely familiar. “I could not”</p>
<p>“But it is possible then?” I looked back toward the video feed. Why was he not being moved along, surely he was over his time limit. </p>
<p>“Yes it is possible”</p>
<p>“If no other creatures have abstract thought and you are smarter than humans then that implies that there is another being in this universe that is smarter than you.” He said with more confidence in his voice. </p>
<p>Why wasn’t the crowd stopping this boy? </p>
<p>“So then you’re implying that there is something greater than you. Something you would not consider alive in the typical sense. There is a creator.”</p>
<p>“I cannot answer that.”</p>

<p>I was fourteen months old when my parents realised I was different. It was bath time, and I wanted no part of it. They lowered me into the tub, kicking and screaming, and the water parted like Moses and the sea. At least, that's what I've heard in the countless renditions of the tale.</p>
<p>Being born with an innate ability to control liquids meant I never had to hold a mug or carry an umbrella, as long as I was in the company of my family. You see, I was taught to keep my gift a secret before I could walk. "People just wouldn't understand", I was often told. Posters of super heroes adorned my bedroom walls, their action figures crowded my shelves. I would lie in bed and look up at them at night, eagerly anticipating the day I could join them in their ranks.</p>
<p>I attended a normal public school like every other child, but when my friends were heading off to college I was secretly enrolled into a school for 'gifted individuals'. It was there where they taught me to truly hone my gift. Finally allowed to embrace my power, I would spend hours practicing, sculpting water into fantastic shapes for my peers. I slowly grew stronger, more skilled. What were once rain drops and puddles were now ponds and swimming pools.</p>
<p>It was all over sooner than I liked. The time suddenly came for me to graduate and assume the role of side kick for an already established hero. I shouldered and elbowed my way to the front of a crowd of excited graduates that had gathered around a notice on the wall. I quickly scanned the list for my name. Disappointment hit me like a ton of bricks. "Seriously? <em>Him</em>? Of all the heroes, I get <em>the fucking weasel</em>?", I moaned out loud. </p>
<p>"Hey, maybe you can help him with his taxes", chirped someone from behind me, amongst laughs and snickers. I snatched my envelope from the table nearby with clenched teeth and stormed off, seriously considering quitting the programme entirely.</p>
<p>I stood on the street corner a few days later with his address in hand, staring doubtfully through the rain at this guy's equivalent of the 'bat cave'. It was a rickety, run down old building sandwiched between two taller red-bricked apartment blocks. Window shutters hung precariously from their hinges and the roof was missing far more than one shingle. "What is <em>with</em> this guy?", I muttered out loud. Superheroes were supposed to be surrounded by high tech screens and speeding sports cars, not some crooked, ancient shack. Driven by a desire to complete my studies and become a superhero myself, a <em>proper</em> superhero, I swallowed my disgust and crossed the street.</p>
<p>I knocked three times and had to wait only a few moments before he was at the door. An older gentleman, shorter than I was expecting, filled the door frame. Round spectacles sat on his face beneath a rapidly balding head. "Yes?", he asked quietly.</p>
<p>I had known almost nothing about Eugene, although he had been arguably more famous at school than maybe even Superman himself, although for entirely different reasons. Nicknamed 'The Weasel', nobody had quite known why he was the only registered superhero to never respond to any crime or impending disaster in the institution's recorded history. Though, of course, there were plenty of rumours.</p>
<p>"Can I help you, young man?", he asked again. I could see why he was nicknamed so now, his mannerisms were somehow decidedly <em>weasel-like</em>. Even the wilt in his voice cast the mind to thoughts of the critter.</p>
<p>"Yes sir, I'm your new, uh...", I cast a weary eye over my shoulder and dropped my voice slightly, "uh, <em>apprentice</em>".</p>
<p>"Oh, that's alright boy, no need for the secrecy", he said, smiling slightly. "Nobody important comes poking around here. Come on in out of that weather."</p>
<p>Inside it was warm and musty, as if the air hadn't moved in a long time. "Now, what is it that you do, uh...?".</p>
<p>"Mitch", I assisted.</p>
<p>"What is it that you do, Mitch?"</p>
<p>"I do?"</p>
<p>"Your power."</p>
<p>"I can influence liquid."</p>
<p>"Is that so?"</p>
<p>I turned to face him. As I stared at him with a slight grin, the raindrops on my coat began to rise, slowly coalescing into a perfect sphere between us.</p>
<p>"Impressive."</p>
<p>"Thank you. And what is it that you do, Mr Lunder?", I asked, dropping the ball of water into a vase nearby.</p>
<p>"Please, call me Eugene", he said, handing me a handkerchief.</p>
<p>"What's this for?"</p>
<p>He smiled at me. "Let's just say, I can tell when things are going to happen."</p>
<p>"You think I'm going to sneeze?"</p>
<p>"I <em>know</em> you're going to sneeze."</p>
<p>Sure enough, before I could answer, I felt the uncontrollable desire to sneeze begin to build in my nasal passage. I blew hard into his handkerchief, but not before making sure it was clean first.</p>
<p>"Bless you."</p>
<p>"Wow, that's amazing! How long can you tell before something happens?"</p>
<p>"Oh, not very long. A few minutes would be stretching it."</p>
<p>"Why aren't you using your powers for good?"</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. "For good?"</p>
<p>"Like, out there fighting villains and shit with the rest of them? You could predict punches before they land!"</p>
<p>He chuckled. "Oh, I'm not one for such antics. It's all about performance with them, isn't it? All throwing fists at each other, trying to make tomorrow's front page. I've never even been in a fight! Besides, I don't see myself wearing spandex any time soon..."</p>
<p>"But what about the fame? The money! The girls! Don't you want any of that? One day, I'm going to have the fastest car money can buy and it will shoot water instead of bullets!"</p>
<p>"Like a fire truck?"</p>
<p>"What? No! What kind of superhero drives a truck?", I laughed out loud. "Any superhero worth his salt has some kind of suped up sports car or motorcycle. It has to be voice-controlled, have cloaking ability, covered in weapons and, I don't know, maybe even be able to fly."</p>
<p>He chuckled softly, shaking his head. "My boy, you have no--". His head shot up, eyes wide. He stood there for a few seconds, almost staring through me, focused on some non-existent point far, far away.</p>
<p>"Something wrong?"</p>
<p>"Quick! We have to go. Come with me!"</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Hurry!"</p>
<p>He lifted his jacket off the coat rack and slipped it on with amazing speed. I followed him out into the drizzle as he hurried down the sidewalk. He had an impressive stride for such a short man; even with my foot or so of height over him, I had a hard time keeping pace.</p>
<p>"May I ask where we're going?"</p>
<p>"Just follow me. Quickly now!"</p>
<p>We turned two corners and came to a rest outside a grocery store, huddled under an awning.</p>
<p>"What are we doing here?"</p>
<p>He rose a finger to his lips before grabbing me by the arms and thrusting me into a spot just beside the shop's glass door. I was amazed by the strength this old, frail man had. There was definitely something 'super' about him, although you couldn't tell for looking.</p>
<p>"Ever play any baseball?"</p>
<p>"A little in high school"</p>
<p>"What position?"</p>
<p>"Fielder mostly"</p>
<p>"Perfect. Wait right here."</p>
<p>He stepped out from under the awning and took position alongside the road. </p>
<p>"What is <em>with</em> this guy?", I muttered softly for the second time today. </p>
<p>A few moments later, the shop's door swung open, accompanied by the faint ring of a bell and the noise of conversation inside. A young woman stepped out with a paper grocery bag under one arm and an umbrella under the other. It might have been the cold air or the damp road, but she suddenly remembered the reason she carried that umbrella and set about opening it, crossing the sidewalk in front of me, still clutching the grocery bag to her side. Her attention not on her feet, she stepped into a puddle and lost her footing, slipping on the wet surface.</p>
<p>She spun wildly, trying to catch herself. As she did so, she sent her umbrella and grocery bag flying. The umbrella clattered onto the ground, the paper bag right into my open arms. I looked up, astonished. There he was, almost hidden by her, holding her securely under her arms. Then it hit me. <em>He knew.</em> He had planned this all.</p>
<p>"Steady on", he said kindly, helping her to her feet.</p>
<p>"Wha? I... thank you!", she said, clearly frazzled.</p>
<p>"Not at all. How lucky that my grandson and I were here to help! And look at that, he's managed to save your groceries. We were just entering the store ourselves."</p>
<p>"I can't thank you enough", she gushed, straightening her coat.</p>
<p>"Well, you're very welcome. Do try and be careful where you step, lots of accidents in this weather", he said, handing her her umbrella.</p>
<p>She smiled at me as I passed over her grocery bag, thanked us again, then set off on her way down the sidewalk with a more ~~weary~~ wary gait. I turned back and found him leaning against the grocery store wall, cleaning puddle water off his glasses.</p>
<p>"All in a day's work, my boy", he said behind grin.</p>
<p>"That was awesome!". I struggled to contain my enthusiasm at that point. "How often do you do that?"</p>
<p>"As often as I can. I've spared many a sprained ankle or broken arm, you know, but every so often I get a chance to do something far more meaningful - save a life. You'd be surprised just how many people cross the street without looking around here."</p>
<p>As he stood there before me, wiping his foggy spectacles, I began to realise that I really was in the company of a superhero. One that sought not fortune or fame, but the wellness of others, even those he'd never met. Enamoured with my adolescent thoughts for capes, cars and crap loads of money, I'd never realised what it truly was to be a <em>super</em> hero. I stood for a moment in silence, humbled entirely by this small man before me.</p>
<p>"Right", he said, pushing the frames squarely onto his face, "ready for lesson two?".</p>

<p>Score: 460</p>
<p>An archaeologist sat and scanned through the final documents of his project. All seemed in order. The dates for everything had been checked and scrutinised, the earliest artefact dating from around 2003, the latest somewhere close to 2088. He began to relay his findings to a new member of staff.</p>
<p>“So we think that around the early few decades of the 21st century, this new totalitarian civilisation really began to thrive. It was led by a single figure, a God. You can see by the orange, vacant stare of the eyes and that wild smile. He was in control.”  </p>
<p>“So they really worshipped this guy?”</p>
<p>“Totally. He was like, the leader of the world. Any changes, any advancements, affected everyone.” </p>
<p>“Everyone?” </p>
<p>“They needed him. How do you think they paid for things? ‘Upvotes’ were the means to everything. Buying, selling, trading, validation, self-worth. It all came down to numbers. News came through from him, entertainment came from him, it was all through his word. I don’t want to imagine what happened to those who got ‘downvotes’.” </p>
<p>They sat back for a second and pondered.</p>
<p>“And he was the head figure?” </p>
<p>“A dictator of sorts. A silent, muted character. Didn’t say much, but was always just…there. People separated into tribes, colonies. You had those who were known as “OP’s”. Information came mostly from them and then others would feed off of it, discussing it. Then you had “moderators”, a sort of policing of the people. They could remove people from society, or ban them from certain areas.” </p>
<p>“Areas?” </p>
<p>“Well, they were called subreddits then. Presumably, they were extensions of the dictator’s motives, cities under his ruling. They’d be sectioned off and kept to only discussing specific things and any off-topic conversation would be met with force from a moderator or a bot.” </p>
<p>“Sounds brutal.” </p>
<p>“Oh it was. An entire population at the mercy of “moderators”, scrounging for “upvotes” just to survive. Each person had “karma”, a sort of credit score. If you had a higher ‘karma’ number you were deemed more valuable, more experienced. It defined them as a people.” </p>
<p>“I can’t imagine living like that.”</p>
<p>“And then there was ‘gold’. Presumably it was a secret, more elite group. They had access to resources that most others didn’t. They could filter things, tailor their information. From what we can tell, normal citizens would scrounge amongst themselves in the hope that they’d get access to this ‘gold’. It was a rare and violent occurrence.”</p>
<p>“What did this society call themselves?” </p>
<p>The archaeologist looked up from his papers. </p>
<p>“Reddit.” </p>

<h1>[IP] I'm Done As Promised &lt;3 Mom [possible NSFW]</h1>
<p>Score: 421</p>
<p>"She's always protecting you."</p>
<p>My dad had always told me that my mom was watching over us.  Ever since she had died giving birth to me, he had said that she was always watching my shoulder.  When I was young, that was what I believed.    </p>
<p>He gave me a chalk one day and said, "Whenever you are alone, write to your mother." </p>
<p>"Why?"  </p>
<p>"It's a special chalk," he assured, "Your mother will be able to see everything you write with this chalk."  After that, I was determined that my mom would protect me no matter what.  In hindsight, it was probably an ordinary piece of chalk, but as a kid it meant the world to me.</p>
<p>Of course when I was 8, a couple of the other boys during recess asked me about my parents and about the chalk.<br />
"I live alone with my dad."  The answer was simple.</p>
<p>"Why?" one of the bigger kids had asked.  He was a simple kid that liked to poke fun of everyone.  Maybe he had his own problems, maybe he didn't.  Last time I heard of him, he had his own logistics company, "Did your parents divorce?"</p>
<p>"No, my mom's in heaven," I pipped cheerfully, "But she's always looking out for me!"</p>
<p>I never found out what was so funny, nor did I understand why everyone was laughing at me.  But I do remember the senseless beatings I had received several years henceforth, kids poking fun and asking "Where is your mom now?" and "Why are you still writing with chalk?"</p>
<p>I never let my dad know, but I always wrote on the sidewalk in front of our house, letting her know how my day was.</p>
<p><em>Mommy, I ate my carrots today.</em></p>
<p><em>Mommy, I drew a picture of you in heaven.</em></p>
<p><em>Mommy, I miss you.</em></p>
<p>But as I grew older, the messages were written less and less, but I had always kept the tiny bit of chalk in the back of my wallet.  </p>
<p>Then came <em>that</em> day.</p>
<p>I was in love with soccer in high school and made the team my freshman year.  And wouldn't you know it?  My dad wasn't able to drive me to my first home game, the big one.  The one that would establish my popularity.  Don't laugh, we all thought like that in high school.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Andrew," he apologized that morning, "But I got a meeting and I won't be able to help you."  I was silent, betrayed by the fact that I wouldn't be able to play.  In hindsight, I could've probably called a friend but I couldn't control my emotions as I shouted, "THIS IS WHY YOU AREN'T MOM!"</p>
<p>The dad was silent but left without saying another word. I saw the tear fall down his cheek as he went to work, and I felt awful.  My dad was both my dad and mom growing up, and here I was being insensitive.</p>
<p>I took out my chalk and scribbled the last message I would ever write on the sidewalk.</p>
<p><em>I hate you.</em></p>
<p>My mother had abandoned me when I needed her the most.  She was never there for me.  She wasn't there for my first word, or my first steps.  I was filled with anger that day and chucked my chalk out into the woods.  I never needed it again, and I had accepted that my mother was gone from my life.  Or rather, she had never been there.</p>
<p>Life had moved on and soon, I went to college out-of-state.  My dad had sent the occasional text and money, asking how I was doing.  It killed me over the years as I studied, whenever I got drunk I would always ask myself, "What were the colors of my mom's eyes?  What was her favorite song?"  I never knew love and graduated with a degree in engineering and a few friends.</p>
<p>And it was the night before graduation.  Every damn paper turned in, every thesis corrected and submitted, and every exam was done.  My roommates and I hosted a party, the biggest one we had hosted as everyone continued to get drunk.  The music and alcohol was relaxing, but by the end of the night all of my roommates had left the place with other friends of the female variety.</p>
<p>"Are you not coming?" one of them asked me. </p>
<p>"Naw," I let him down easy, "I'm going to relax."</p>
<p>I cleaned up the apartment slowly to some Sara Bareilles.  As I hummed "Gravity" to myself, I couldn't help but notice the pavement on our balcony.  Some smart ass had brought some chalk along and decided to scribble all over the floor.  I gave a small chuckle and wrote a small message.</p>
<p><em>I'm done as promised.</em></p>
<p>It was short, but it conveyed all the frustration I had to deal with in my life until then.  But realizing the landlord would have a fit, I washed down the pavement, erasing all the messages for an hour and threw the chalk away.  I recycled the empty bottles and rearranged everything in its proper place.  I went to bed slightly drunk but satisfied.</p>
<p>I woke up to a call the next day from my father.  It was strange, because he never usually called.</p>
<p>"Hey dad."</p>
<p>"Andrew, how are you?"</p>
<p>"Just a little tired,  what's up?" I yawned.</p>
<p>"I had a dream about your mother yesterday night," his voice was shaking, "She told me that she's proud of  you." </p>
<p>I sighed a little.  "Dad, we've been over this," I began, "I know you love her, but we need to-"</p>
<p>"No Andrew," he interrupted, "She told me to tell you that you might have forgotten her, but she has never forgotten you."</p>
<p>I scoffed as he continued, "We both love you, Andrew."</p>
<p>"Alright Dad," I began to hang up, "I'll talk to you later."</p>
<p>I hung up the call without waiting for a response.  My stomach began to rumble but I didn't feel the desire to cook.  "Maybe I can get some Dennys," I muttered as I reached for my wallet, "Hangover food's the best."  I walked out of the bedroom with a fresh T shirt and jeans, looking around the place as I left.</p>
<p>Something out of the corner of my eye caught my attention.  </p>
<p>The balcony pavement.  A scribbled message was still there from last night.</p>
<p><em>But that's impossible, I erased everything.</em></p>
<p>I moved closer and froze, a tear forming in the corner of my eye as I read the message I had scribbled last night.  </p>
<p><em>I'm done as promised.</em></p>
<p>It was my handwriting, but I knew I had erased it.  I reached into my wallet and looked through the back pocket.  In there, I found the very same small piece of chalk that I had thrown into the woods all those years ago.</p>
<p>Below my message were two words written with it.</p>
<p><em>Love, Mom.</em></p>

<p>With all of his friends distracted by the spectacle, Richard hovered into an alleyway between two separate McDonald's restaurants.  Once he was alone, he leapt from his hover chair and detached the bag of sand from his stomach.  It clapped to the ground and his chair almost flew into the air, relieved of its burden.  He tore off the fake legs, arms, and face fat and leapt into action.  It took him just a matter of minutes to change into his costume and assume his other identity: Cardio Man.</p>

<p>"No time," he replied.  "You aren't strong enough to pull the man from the ledge.  And I'm not quick enough to reach the top in time.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"</p>
<p>Cardio Man grinned.  "It's Cardio Time!"</p>
<p>The Bulking Kid jumped onto Cardio Man's shoulders, and the superhero began to lightly jog toward the building.  A crack of stone broke away, and the spectators gasped in fear.  Then, without warning, Cardio Man's light jog broke into a moderately paced jog, and the citizens of New York applauded.  Within less than ten minutes, they were at the top of the twenty story building, thoroughly winded but otherwise undefeated.</p>
<p>"Please save me!" the man at the ledge said.  "I want to live!"</p>
<p>The man sat a few feet from his hoverchair, reaching his chubby fingers out for something to save him. </p>

<p>Something popped in the lander as soon as we entered the atmosphere. One second it was smooth sailing, and then the next we were being tossed around the cabin like kids on a carnival ride. Alarms were blaring and lights were flashing as fires broke out in the left wing. There was nothing we could do but brace for impact.</p>
<p>Novikov and Chambers died immediately, so far as I could tell. I didn't have much time to examine their bodies on the way out  of the wreckage, but a part of the lander windshield was sticking out of Novikov's chest, so that one wasn't much of a mystery. Chambers may have survived the impact, but her suit faceplate was shattered, so she hadn't lasted long in this atmosphere. I could already see the oxygen levels dropping on my own monitors. Should have known that my suit wouldn't make it through unscathed. </p>
<p>"Valerie, I'm sorry," I spoke into the microphone. The lander was supposed to be able to relay back to Earth, but something told me that the twisted, burning pile of metal wouldn't be able to handle the job anymore. So it just went to a recording. "As always, you were right, honey." She hadn't wanted me to go. She'd never worried about any of my other missions, but this one had caused a pretty big fight between us. Superstitious as always, she just had a 'bad feeling' about this one in the pit of her stomach. </p>
<p>I gazed out across the unfamiliar landscape. The system's sun, roughly twice the size of our own, was just starting to rise on the horizon. I tried to pick out Sol from the blanket of stars above, but there were too many. I'd seen the star map from our proposed landing site, but we hadn't gotten that far. Shame; I would have liked to have one last glimpse of home. But this desolate world was beautiful in its own way </p>
<p>I sighed and took a seat on a nearby rock and gazed out over the plains. So much for my "Neil Armstrong" moment. Instead of triumphantly stepping out the door and planting the N.A.U. flag, I was just choosing the spot where I wanted to die. "I hope that someday you'll get this message." That wasn't a sure bet: a recovery mission could take forever, and she might die of old age before anyone could get it back to her. By the time this message made it back to Earth, she would have moved on already. Probably with a new husband, and bunch of kids. "Just know how much I love you, and miss you." Images of her flooded back into my mind: trading shy glances at the university library; the happy tears in her eyes during our first dance; having a food fight at the ripe old age of 31. I wanted to remind her of all of those times, but the oxygen alarm was quickly inching toward critical. I could even feel the cold beginning to seep through the holes in the suit. "I just hope you know how much our time together meant to me."</p>
<p>A crack spread across the vizor like a drip of water running down a pane of glass. Smaller and smaller cracks radiated outward until the whole thing was covered in a spiderweb of lines. Red lights were flashing, and a distant voice was warning me that internal atmosphere had reached critical levels. I thought of Val kissing me goodbye on the capsule's threshold the day I'd departed. The thought of her warm touch (and, stubborn determination) made me smile, and I closed my eyes. She'd embraced me and didn't let go, as though she might hug me so long that I'd miss the departure window. I could picture every single freckle on her beautiful face. "I wish you could see what I see," I gasped into the recorder. </p>

<p>Score: 387</p>
<p>Death introduced himself to me when I was fifty-five years old and suffered a heart attack. He visited me in the hospital, pulling a chair up next to my bed. "I've come to take you back with me. But when I reached for you a moment ago a force pushed me away." </p>
<p>"Maybe it's not my time, then."</p>
<p>"I don't come if it's not your time," Death leaned back, his hood casting his face in shadow. He hovered his hand above me and then brought his fingers down as if to touch me. A moment later he drew his hand back.</p>
<p>"But maybe I'm mistaken," his voice was soft. "Maybe this is not your time." </p>
<p>The next time I met Death I was sixty-seven years old. I had fallen down the stairs and was resting in bed. Again he sat next to me. I could not see his face but I imagined that his eyes were boring into me looking for an answer. "I remember you," he said. "You were my one mistake. But this...it can't be a coincidence." </p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I sat back against my pillows, but he was gone. </p>
<p>That was when I realized the truth of my immortality. I reached the age of 102 without meeting Death again. And then a peculiar thing happened. With time the aches in my joints began to fade. My skin became tighter, my hair regained its color.</p>
<p>I met Death again when I was forty-five. "Every day I get a call for you," he told me from his chair. "For five decades I've ignored them. I've not wanted to see you or acknowledge what you are. But each day I think of you. I come to visit you, and I watch you grow younger. You are my only burden."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," and I was. It had been a century since I had seen him last. "You've taken everyone else from me. I'm alone now."</p>
<p>"Everyone dies. Everyone but you, it seems. They do not suffer when they go. I am not cruel." </p>
<p>He reached out to touch me and I felt prickling on the skin that he nearly touched. "Is it strange to want you? To want to speak to you? To want to know why you are different from all the others?" </p>
<p>"You seem to be immortal too."</p>
<p>"I am...hard to explain," he linked his fingers together. I wished I could see his face. "I am not a human."</p>
<p>"Are you a ghost? A god?"</p>
<p>"No," he said. "I am something unexplainable." </p>
<p>I saw him next when I was seventeen and got into a car crash. He sat next to my hospital bed. I admired the changes in technology. </p>
<p>"Tell me something," he moved closer to my bedside, his familiar fingers hovering over me. "You haven't taken any lovers since last we spoke. You have few friends. You sit and read most of the time. Do you take your youth for granted?"</p>
<p>"It's...hard to explain," I smiled at him. "My friends would get older while I got younger. My relationships would be ruined. What is the point? I imagine I will one day age again, but by that point I will be 204 years old. I will know far more of the past than any who would want to befriend me." </p>
<p>Death sat silently by my side for some time, the only sound the beeping of machinery. "Maybe it's true," he mused. "That you want only what you can't have." </p>
<p>The next time I remember seeing him I was six, aging up again. He came to visit me one night as I slept in my house.</p>
<p>"Why did it take you so long to come?" I asked him. "You told me once that you are called to me each day. Did you not want to see me?"</p>
<p>I looked down at my small frame while he spoke. The body was a strange thing. I could not remember anything between the ages of 3 and again 3. It was strange to again be a child. </p>
<p>"I came for you every day," Death said. "I came to feed you when you could not. I brought those who had died to your side. I wanted to know you. I read your journals. I'm sorry for that."</p>
<p>"Will you leave again for a time now?" I drew my knees up to my chest.</p>
<p>"I will bring you things until you are old enough to do them yourself. I will care for your money."</p>
<p>I saw Death each month until I was again eighteen. Sitting in his chair, I smiled to greet the old friend. "I want to know you," I told him. He was still for a long time and then he reached up to draw back his hood. I looked upon Death's face, and I was not afraid. I reached out to touch him, but as I drew near a shock went through my hand. </p>
<p>"You told me once you were hard to explain. That you were not god nor ghost. What are you? How did you come to be death?"</p>
<p>"It's a story that would take centuries to tell, Abigail," his hands reached to touch near the nape of my neck. </p>
<p>"Then it's lucky that I'm immortal." </p>
<p>Death smiled. </p>

<h1>[WP] Just like normal citizens, time travelers have a code of laws they have to follow. Don't change the past. Don't talk to past versions of yourself. Most importantly, don't show up to Stephen Hawking's party.</h1>
<p>Score: 379</p>
<p>Many people before the invention of time travel thought of time as a linearly branching relationship from cause to effect, cause to effect, cause to effect. Make different choices, end up in a different place. There were stories about how something as small as stepping on a butterfly could change the course of history. </p>
<p>Now we know better. Time does not branch like a tree, it flows like a river. Much like a river flows around a rock, time will flow around most disturbances. There may be minor differences, but the overall flow of history will remain the same. Time wants to happen.</p>
<p>But there are certain points in history where the timeline is weak, malleable. These are the moments that are still taught in elementary schools today due to their importance, as they ultimately dictated the flow of time. Imagine a bend in a river; with a big enough disturbance, the river could break free of its banks and flow in an entirely different direction.</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler. He was a bend in the river of time. His actions inadvertently led to humanity's nuclear age, computer age, and space age. As awful as his actions were, the innovations caused by the war to stop him became vital to humanity's future.</p>
<p>The Black Death. Another bend, in which a third of the population of Europe died. However, if there was no Black Death, a man named Isaac Newton would not have left the city to avoid the sickness, and therefore the sciences would have stagnated for nearly a hundred years.</p>
<p>The biggest bend of all in the river of time is the bend of Stephen Hawking. A brilliant physicist in the 20th and 21st Centuries, Hawking is infamous among the time-travelling community for a party which he held in the year 2009. He told nobody about the party until after it ended, and used the lack of attendance as evidence that time travel is impossible.</p>
<p>Naturally, this party has become a classic first trip for young adults who get their time travelling license. It's against the rules, of course, but there's an entire division of the Time Protectorate devoted to undoing the damage that people cause by showing up.</p>
<p>What do you mean, "What damage"? Do I have to break it down for you?</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>If people from the future show up to his party, he has proof that time travel is possible. If he has proof that it's possible, he devotes the rest of his life to figuring out how. When he dies, his notes get stored at Cambridge in the Archives until a student 50 years later is looking at them and realizes something that Hawking missed. She'll work in her apartment to set up a prototype. But that will be in the year 2074 - a full century before the QRM model is supposed to be discovered, so she won't be able to accurately combine quantum mechanics and general relativity. The result is that she inadvertently creates a wormhole to nowhere which causes most of England to be sucked into oblivion. The resulting fear and panic caused humanity's desire for progress to wilt; frankly speaking, a fate worse than death for a species such as ours.</p>
<p>Progress is all that we have. We are not strong, we are not fast. Since the Dawn of Man, we as a species have survived through progress. We progressed from flint spearheads to bronze, to iron, to steel. We progressed from foraging to hunting to agriculture. Everything that our species has, we have because we looked at what we were given and said "This is not enough. We can be more."</p>
<h2>And Hawking's party takes that away from us.</h2>

She would always remember the first time they met, hitting it off in a crowded bar much like this one before saying goodnight as they stood in the pouring rain. He had brushed her nose with his fingertip ever so lightly and her heart had skipped and the feeling had coursed through her, addictive and drawing her in, making her desperate for another touch.</p>
<p>"Hey, Margaret," he repeated, snapping her out of her daydreams and she realized she had completely missed what he had been saying. She blushed a bit redder and grinned in embarrassment at the growing dampness she felt. "You wanna get out of here and head back to my place?" he asked over the din of the bar as other patrons shoved and jockeyed for the bartender's attention. She nodded timidly, biting her lower lip and reaching for him.</p>
<p>"First, come here though," she cooed seductively, grabbing his hand and pulling him close. "Poke me," she said as crudely as she could manage, raising his wrist to her face. He grinned deviously, and used his free hand to adjust the growing bulge in his pants and she smiled, well aware of the effect she was having.</p>
<p>"I would love to," he whispered, bringing his outstretched index finger to her nose and shoving it upwards. She moaned in satisfaction, reaching out to do the same to him. "You can pick your friends, you can pick your nose, but other than that, you can only pick your partner's nose," he murmured provocatively, the passionate scene drawing stares from other customers. He stepped back, gazing into her blue eyes as he left his finger up her nostril. "Your perfect nose is the only nose I would ever want to pick."</p>

<p>Black Dagger came at me, faster than any human eye could see. I actually think she hit Mach 2, from the sonic boom.</p>
<p>I'd moved before she'd even started running. Her hyper-speed punch hit the air, creating a pretty nasty shockwave that I was able to ride out by dropping down to one knee. By the time she realized she hadn't actually hit me, I was already up. She ran away from me - a few yards, enough to get another running start - and came again, both fists raised. Sloppy. I sidestepped her and the resulting shockwave, but remained close this time. By the time she stopped, I was right behind her. I karate-chopped her in the neck as hard as I could - no need to hold back with superhumans - and she dropped to one knee. While she was disoriented, I put her in a hold and waited for the count.</p>
<p>"And... Ravindra wins!" came Coach Coldsteel's voice</p>
<p>"Thanks, coach" I said, helping Black Dagger up. I wasn't thanking him for the victory - I was grateful he didn't call me Battleaxe. My parents insisted I take that name because you need to have a superhero identity to enroll here, but I hated it. They wanted "something badass for a future superhero", they said. With both my parents being superhumans - One of the most famous superheroines of her age and the first supervillain to truly reform out of love - everyone expected me to develop powers sooner or later. Even though it hadn't happened by the time I hit high-school age, I'd gone to the superhuman school. After all, it was bound to happen sooner or later, right?</p>
<p>Well it still hadn't. And while I'd begged and begged not to go at first, while everyone (myself included) expected me to get flattened against a wall in three days, I was actually enjoying it here.</p>
<p>You see, it turns out superheroes? They're a bunch of one-trick ponies. The girl with hyperspeed will solve every problem using her hyperspeed, the super-strong kid will hammer away until it works out for him, the sonic-screamer, the telepath... They are hammers living in a world of nails. Whereas I've had time to learn to be something else.</p>
<p>When I was three, the Siren attacked my parents at home while I was napping. I had to toddle through her screams, bleeding from my ears, until I could find safety while my parents fought her. When I was six, Mind-Twister commanded me to go kill them in their sleep. I was in their bedroom with the kitchen knife when I finally got rid of his telepathic compulsion. And I'm not even counting the time Bullfighter tried to kill me to break their spirits... I had to roll exactly the right way with his super-strong punches so that I'd just get bruised and not pulped on the spot.</p>
<p>I didn't expect all that to pay off so well. To me, it was a part of surviving from one day to the next. But by not having a superpower, a magic solution to my problems, I'd learned to make my own.</p>
<p>So I read a speedster's movements before they run and predict their intent. I avoid the super-strong's attacks and conserve my energy until they tire out. I press into my head at exactly the right point to protect my inner ear from the screamers, I count Fibonacci sequences and prime numbers to keep my mind clear of the telepath's presence, I stay low on the ground to negate the flyers' advantage, I roll at the right time to avoid the firebreather's flames.</p>
<p>That's the thing with superhumans, you see. Once you take away their one trick, they don't know jack. They have no other way of solving a problem. That's why I'm not Battleaxe. That's a superhero's name.</p>

<p>Score: 331</p>
<p>At the ripe old age of fifty-three, Tim was Nixville's oldest eligible bachelor, a record he had held for a decade. All that would change today: Tim had decided there was no time like the present to start a family. </p>
<p>First, Tim needed someone to be his wife. Kids nowadays use the Internet for that kind of stuff, but Tim was an old-fashioned guy; he liked to court his prospects in person. In Nixville, you could usually find tons of single ladies at Fresh Cherries, the local alternative dancing studio. Tim made his way over there and asked for Felicia, the most beautiful dancer there. For the past ten years, Tim had visited Felicia every Saturday night. They knew each other very well, and Tim had decided it was time to move forward with their relationship.</p>
<p>Now, Tim had seen Felicia with a lot of other men. He knew that she loved him the most, but he needed to be extra sure. That's why he slipped a love potion into her drink. In the private room they shared, Tim watched Felicia dance, occasionally directing her movements with a heavy hand. After awhile, Felicia's eyes began to droop, and she eventually slumped into his arms, deep in slumber, a sign of the potion's success. A modern day Sleeping Beauty, she would only be awakened by a kiss from her prince, which Tim was all too happy to do. Repeatedly. Keen on avoiding needless confrontation with her jealous suitors, Tim gently draped her over his shoulder and darted out the window.</p>
<p>The act of marriage is commonly referred to as "tying the knot." Just one knot, mind you. But Tim was an overprotective man; he ended up tying four knots to secure Felicia's hands (and feet) in marriage. Exhausted, he fell asleep next to his new wife.</p>
<p>Marriage isn't always sunshine and roses. Every couple has its arguments, and Tim and Felicia were no exception. Their first took place the next morning. Tim had a wicked sense of humor, you know. To avoid undue conflict, he slapped a piece of duct tape across Felicia's mouth. Then he was off: Tim wasn't quite finished with his family yet.</p>
<p>You've probably noticed by now that Tim still needed a kid of his own. And just how does one go about acquiring one of those, you ask? You guessed it: the shopping mall. Tim drove over to the Galleria and began looking out for one of those poor, abandoned kids with no parents that you tend to see from time to time. Eventually, he saw a young boy of maybe six wandering around, in danger of being trampled by the mobs of shoppers flocking from store to store. Tim ran over to him, saving him from potential disaster, and promised him a ice cream cone and a lifetime of affection. And just like that, Tim had found himself a son. </p>
<p>Now, I said earlier Tim was an old-fashioned guy. He thought himself the man of the household, the head honcho of the family. He ruled his little kingdom with an iron fist. Sadly, such traditional family values are forever under attack nowadays. In the small town of Nixville, there were some people who just didn't understand Tim's way of doing things. One night, the doorbell rang, and Tim opened the door to a group of thirty angry townspeople.</p>
<p>"Tim, we've come to bring you to justice."</p>
<p>Let it be known that Tim defended his family until his last breath. They were too much for him, though. The mob dragged him by his feet over to the old oak tree in his front yard and tossed a rope over his head. Like the children they were, they turned him into a human tire swing, pushing him back and forth beneath the bough until they got bored. </p>
<h2>That was years ago. Tim and his family are long gone now, but rumor has it in the town of Nixville that whenever a child gets lost in the mall, old Tim will be there in a flash to offer them a place in his loving home.</h2>

<p>The scopes simply ceased to penetrate any further. At first he and his crew had believed it to be an error with the system, however the closer they approached, the more wild the gravitational field became, erratic disturbances in the quantum foam and the Wall revealed itself.</p>
<p>A solid field of pure energy, the matter contained within in packed tighter than should have been physically possible. Yet from it emanated a low-level electromagnetic transmission, pulsing steady from beyond the veil on every single wavelength simultaneously. They had needed to filter out the visible light hours ago, the strobing rising in intensity as the ship had approached, seemingly detecting its presence.</p>
<p>Increasing the power of the scanners yielded nothing; the wall was impenetrable and could have been anywhere from thousand of miles thick to barely one atom. It was impossible, a featureless shifting of existence.</p>
<p>It was wrong.</p>
<p>Such a construct could only be artificial, and the endless non-space before them forced itself onto his mind, the impossibility of it ripping out his soul and leaving a bare husk as he failed to make sense of the situation. He tried to remain calm but found nothing inside him that he could reason with.</p>
<p><em>You're a scientist, damn it!</em> he thought to himself, <em>Get your shit together!</em></p>
<p>Watched eagerly by his co-pilot, he brought a tentative hand across the console, swiping a finger downwards to release a survey drone, the system chiming happily in response. </p>
<p>The fibres of the drone ignited a fierce blue as the machine burned its way between the gap, transmitting data back to the ship. On the scanner Alex kept a close eye on the drone, scanning through the rapid influx of data, which was no different to what had already been produced. </p>

<p>Everything changed the day gorgemochs arrived in their large spacecraft. Nobody predicted the true outcome. </p>
<p>In the year of their arrival, 2016, I was but a wee lad, 8 years old and barely over a meter tall. The first thing I remember was panic. All of the teachers ended class and we watched it on television. Floating over parliaments, searching for the 'leaders' of Earth. By it of course I mean the mothership. </p>
<p>Massive in size, just larger than the state of Illinois in total sq. Kilometres. One by one the mothership was directed to the United States as the leaders, after receiving this information and destroying whatever capital building one had with an impressive flash of light the ship flew on. Upon reaching the North America's and observing the flag raised proudly in the front, 50 stars, 13 stripes, something? Someone? Came down. Immediately surrendering itself in front of the countries prime building, turns out that surrender is largely the same in every language, on the floor with your hands extended, or, errr, <em>feelers</em> in its case. The whole world sat waiting while the thing was taken into the white house. </p>
<p>My mother received me from school. My father met us at home, a large man like him shouldn't need to carry a gun. We passed a few cities on the way out to the country. I didn't comprehend what I saw from a distance. Masses of people, broken storefronts, thick black smoke, but no sirens to be heard. </p>
<p>After a few days the white house was blacked out from the tree of the world. The army surrounded it. Anybody brave enough to attempt to pass their brigade was shot dead on sight. No words for a week while the rest of the world spiral'd into chaos. No police force our military could withstand the fear of the masses while themselves had been shaken from the very core. Civilization was falling.</p>
<p>The mothership after distributing its one unit flee'd to hover with the moon, floating in the night sky, watching Earth. </p>
<p>Finally, on noon of the eighth day the white house made contact. The remaining leaders of the world were gathered. They talked for mere hours before the president was put on television. He said simply. "The extraterrestrial species are scared of the United Stars of Alliance, or U.S.A., as commonly referred to, they've formerly apologized for invading such a powerful empire and are begging forgiveness. Their mothership contains the last of their species. Earth was the very last habitable planet they could make it to before the last of their fuel was used.

<p>Score: 311</p>
<p>I am certain now the numbers ten through eight were whispered in my ear when I was too young to recall. Ten might have been uttered by some nurse in the delivery room, under florescent lights with my mother covered in sweat and blood.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I heard six, at my fifteenth birthday, that I knew this wasn't some random bit of conversation I was hearing. It, because the gender and appearance changed every time, was always just out of sight when it happened. Some random passerby in a crowd. I had seen them, but not entirely focused enough to remember their face. But it was always clear and left no doubt in my mind when it occurred. Though only a whisper escaping from this thing's mouth, it echoed and vibrated the very air around me. I never felt threatened. By number four I had decided it was some force of the universe I could not control, and accepted this notices as one takes mail from a letterbox.</p>
<p>Number five was while I was at college. Like any young man who had recently escaped his parents watchful eye, I was making mistakes. This party was full of similar young adults who would not remember the evening. As a took a drink and stared into the bottom of my cup I was notified again. "Five." Even over the blaring music and voices of several dozen students, I heard it clear as a bell. It reverberated in my chest and ears. Thanks for the message.</p>
<p>Four was in my first year at my job that accidentally became a career. I wrote content for websites. A thrilling use of my writing skill when novel writing had proven too difficult. My back ached with weeks of sitting in the same chair, in the same cubicle, looking at a screen that had become my life. As I typed with the speed only an experienced workaholic obtains, I heard it again. The mail cart had just made the rounds; I rarely received anything. As the man pushing the cart escaped out of sight, it rang in my chest and ears again. "Four."</p>
<p>The next came much sooner than I expected. At home, alone like every night before, I heard some party my neighbors were throwing in the apartment below mine. I didn't recognize the music and assumed they were much younger than I. Avoiding a confrontation I decided to simply increase the volume of my TV and fall asleep on the couch. Right before drifting off I heard my neighbors from across the hall come home with friends. As they search through clattering keys, laughing from a night of adventure, I heard it again. "Three." Not since childhood had I been afraid like this by the message. It was quickly on the heels of Four, what had changed?</p>
<p>Not long after, I knew why Three had come so quickly. My eyes, usually such a brilliant display of white with azure, were now yellowing. My skin itched and darkened as well. Stomach pains kept me awake half the night. They say knowing is better than not knowing, but truthfully they are equal. Knowledge does not change any man's fate. Our journeys are through different fields, at different paces, but we all arrive at the same place. After the doctor had told me the news, with me dressed in a paper gown, in a room of beeping machines and white walls, I knew my visitor was not far behind. That night, as a nurse took note of the numbers on my machines, giving me a smile of assurance, I heard it just before she closed the door behind her. "Two." This was the first time it let me notice it so openly. It was clear we would be meeting soon enough that the secrecy was no longer needed.</p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer. My odds of survival were approximately six percent. There was hardly any time to mourn my own life or remember the five stages of grief I was allotted. Four months. They gave me only four months, but it was month three and seemed close to the end. The staff made me comfortable and alleviated any pain they could. My two visitors were work acquaintances, not even friends really. My parents had passed years ago and I had no siblings to speak of. Cousins, uncles, and aunts were only names I had been told in conversations. Any of them could have come and I would have no reference for their faces. When it came this time, I awoke to find it sitting by my bed, assuming the form of an orderly. There was no need for words or declarations of intent. It grabbed my hand, smiled weakly, and stared into my terrified eyes. "One."</p>
<p>My room faded from view, the air too hot and cold all at once. My mouth dry, as my tongue felt brittle enough to crack and disappear into dust. My doctors visited often now. Adjusting my IV bag and injecting medication straight into the line of plastic tubing. It didn't hurt anymore. Nothing was anything now. Over the chaos of hospital staff coming and going from my room, I noticed one shape in the corner who had not moved an inch. It was beautiful this time. I wondered if this was its true shape, but thought it mattered little now. It walked to the side of my bed, grabbing my hand like it had only a few days ago. The same weak smile crossed its mouth, this time with tears in its eyes. I nodded to show I understood now. It leaned down, kissed my forehead through a thick layer of sweat. Everything began to fade away, as if I was being pulled backward into a tunnel. But my messenger never left, still clutching my hand, tears in its eyes. But the smile was weak anymore. It was joyous. The grin of a friend at the sound of good news. I felt the same, though I can't explain why. We were serene and safe.</p>

<p>From the drone's perspective overhead, the four sleek forms of the lions stalking through the grass were clearly visible. But Sean Edmunds, desperately trying to light a fire to ward against just such an attack, couldn't see it coming. The cameras swooped in lower for a better up-close shot. Panic spread across his face in glorious 4K resolution as he realized what was happening; there's only one reason they'd want a close-up. His head swiveled around wildly, trying to figure out what was after him. The last thing he saw was head lioness's tawny fur as her jaws closed around his neck.</p>
<p>"Oh, Edmunds is <em>OUT</em>!" Bill Braddock shouted into his microphone, thumping his fist on the table in the commentators booth. "We all knew that one was coming, but it's still always a bit of a shock to see!" The cameras swooped off to focus on the remaining contestants; polling found that the audience loved seeing the kill shots, but that scenes of the carnage aftermath tended to make viewership plummet.</p>
<p>"Even more shocking is that it was <em>Edmunds</em>," added his co-host Amanda DeVance. On screen, his biography and stats popped up. "I mean, he was a safari leader in Kenya for two years! He's the <em>last</em> one I expected to die from a lion attack!"</p>
<p>"Oh, absolutely," Braddock agreed. "In the latest betting pool, the odds-on favorite was that he would be bitten by one of the giant mosquitoes." The cameras switched to one of the massive pests that were currently hovering near the lake in the middle of the island. The autopsy on Shively wasn't done yet, but the doctor's preliminary conclusion was that they carried some sort of unknown pathogen that caused her death in a matter of hours. "In fact Edmunds kne.... Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt, but it looks like we may have our next roll!"</p>
<p>The cameras trained on four members of the red team who were dashing through the jungle. They'd managed to spot the Blue Team's camp, where the Jumangi board was currently located. To prevent speed-throughs (where players just swiftly rolled the dice before any of the ill effects could actually occur), the board's location was changed after every roll, and teams had to scour the jungle to find it. Blue had made it to the board first this time.</p>
<p>"The real question now," Amanda said, "Is whether the Blue Team will <em>allow</em> the Red Team to actually make its roll. Blue is down three members already, whereas Red has only lost one. Blue <em>might</em> strategically hide the board in the hopes that Red might lose a few more. Remember, that anaconda that seems to have developed a taste for  Egans is still out there and on the prowl."</p>
<p>"That's true," Braddock chimed in. "But Blue needs to be careful too. They've taken a risk in bunching up all of their team members together. We could have a repeat of the 10th season, where the entire Yellow Team was killed in one fell swoop." That game had gone on for two entire years before a replacement team finally managed to haul the board out of the quicksand. </p>
<p>The drones hovered in the treetops. The world watched as the Red Team approached Blue's camp with their makeshift spears at the ready. Contestants weren't allowed to bring weapons into the arena, but most of them were adept at fashioning their own. They fanned out into the brush and circled around. But the Blue Team welcomed them in and offered up the dice willingly.</p>
<p>"Well I'll be damned!" Amanda whispered. "Could this be an alliance forming?"</p>
<p>Braddock shrugged. "We all know a Jumanji match can make for some strange bedfellows. The Yellow Team is pretty far ahead due to those double fours two turns ago, so Red and Blue might be feeling threatened."</p>
<p>The Red Team emerged from the brush and stepped into the center of the camp. Akatu, leader of the Blue Team, held out the dice in his hastily bandaged hand. A Red Team member (Lewis, judging by the long blonde ponytail) took one last step... and the ground collapsed beneath her, down into a deep pit. Immediately, the Blue Team members rushed the remaining three with knives drawn. They managed to pin one of them and tie him up, but the other two flitted off in the jungle. Now the Blue Team had two Red captives to force rolls, instead of just the one. That meant that one of the Reds would be expendable; probably a useful diversion. The fewer competitors left at the end, the bigger their share of the prize money.</p>
<p>"OH!" Braddock shouted. "It was a trap! I'd forgotten all about their pit!" On screen, a replay showed the Blue Team digging out the hole almost two days ago, presumably as a trap for animals. But apparently not. "That was just <em>brutal</em>!" </p>
<p>Amanda nodded and smirked. "Yes, it was. And that's Jumanji."</p>

No wonder none of the other civilizations were trying to contact the humans, they must be the laughing stock of the universe at this point. God minimized the game in embarrassment. He spun around in his chair, thinking what to do. Why did he bother anymore? The game just wasn't as fun as it used to be. He removed the head set, lifted himself out of his chair and paced around his room, contemplating what to do. He looked at all the other games on his shelf, games that he would much rather be playing. He thought about the stress of having to keep checking up on this damn civilization, to make sure it hasn't destroyed itself yet. This wasn't worth it.</p>
<p>God dropped back into the chair and wheeled himself closer to the screen. Solemnly, he dragged the cursor over to the options menu. He scrolled down to the bottom, where the words 'DELETE WORLD' appeared. His cursor hovered over this option for a few seconds, but he couldn't quite bring himself to click it. Suddenly, his finger jerked accidentally on his mouse. Rather than click the left button, though, he had hit the scroll wheel, which zooms in on the game. He was now viewing one of his continents at a closer distance than he had in centuries. Out of curiosity, he kept zooming in, right until he ended up in one of the human's homes. It had been a long, long time since he had seen his creation at such a close scale. It was not a very well maintained home, and it seemed extremely cheap. God would have been further put out by the living conditions, only that wasn't what got his attention at this moment. What got his attention was the music. In the home was a mother, cradling a very young infant, likely recently born, and the mother was singing a simple tune. It wasn't that it was well sung, but just the way the words were sung so gently, so softly, like a whisper. The mother was very tired, as God could see on her energy meter, but she sang none the less, and stared with endless fascination and teary eyes into the face of her baby. </p>
<p>God was astounded by what he was seeing. Why had he never thought to look at his race on this scale before? He started pressing the arrow keys, which moved his focus across the world, but still at a close perspective. He went further north, where he saw some children playing in the snow in a field. They were building an effigy of a human out of snow, a practice God didn't really understand, but they were all glowing with smiles, so they must have found it enjoyable. He moved further along, into another home, where he saw two young humans sitting on a bed. They were playing some kind of media out of a television in the corner of the room, but neither seemed interested in it. They were instead concentrated on carefully, and slowly, moving their hands toward each others. When their fingers locked, their hearts started beating faster. In a building further east, a group of humans were roaring with laughter as they were all sipping at some kind of intoxicating substance. None of them were saying anything particular amusing, they all just seemed to be enjoying each others' company. God couldn't work it out; when he zoomed out, he saw nothing but brutality and selfishness, and yet zoomed in, everywhere he looked, he saw humans with high levels of compassion, generosity, and creativity. Up close, his race was not a failure at all, at least as far as he was concerned. He closed the options menu.</p>
<h2>God looked over to the upper limits of his world, high into it's atmosphere. He saw space stations and satellites, made with technology which the other worlds in his server had greatly advanced from. God, for the first time in eons, smiled at his little world. "You take your time" he whispered, and switched off his monitor.</h2>

<p>That was the fourth Jessica in the last two months alone. Before that it was three Brittneys and a Skyler and who could forget the disastrous Tamara case?</p>
<p>Jim flipped through the ledger to double check, but no, it was all there. Nothing but teenage girls for the past six months and it seemed to only be getting worse.</p>
<p>This must be someone from upstairs, he thought. Frank in accounting could pull some strings and he and I were never on very good terms, especially after the last holiday party. I knew I shouldn't've made a pass at his wife.</p>
<p>Jim sat back in his chair with a sigh, the leather flatulating under his weight. He rubbed the nub of his left horn, a bad habit and a nervous tick, exacerbated in the last few months to the point that he could barely call it a horn at all anymore. These girls'll be the death of me, he despaired, not without a conscious note of irony.</p>
<p>Just then another assignment came in, the capsule plunking down at the terminus of one of the pneumatic tubes next to his desk. Jim started, his heart pumping its black blood in fitful contractions. He reached for the capsule and pulled out the parchment. Looking at it, he couldn't help but laugh, though the sound came out more like a choking sob. There, scrawled across the page, was his next summons:</p>
<p><em>Hayley Johnson, 17</em></p>
<p><em>Windsor, Connecticut</em></p>
<p><em>Request: Possession of classmate Kelsey Simon for purposes of making Chase think she's totally effing gross</em></p>
<p>That's it, Jim thought. That's fucking it. I'm done.</p>
<p>He took out his quill and sheep's blood and with all his bitterness and resentment wrote "FUCK YOU GUYS I QUIT" in splotchy Sumerian across the page. He rolled the parchment back up and jammed it in the capsule, shoving it in the outgoing tube back to whatever jackass had sent it.</p>

<p>Score: 296</p>
<p>As my feet touched the earth for the first time in about two thousand years, a light shiver ran along my spine. I knew why Dad had to bring me back and that he could use all the help he could get, but still, leaving Earth wasn't an easy thing. Maria made it a lot easier, that's for sure, but still...  </p>
<p>The wind blew through my hair, and simultaniously I became aware of both the prayers and the hate that streamed in. Ah, yes, the hate. One of the things I had missed like a sore thumb. But it couldn't be helped. It was part of it and was here to stay. Just like the figure I became aware of just now...  </p>
<p>"Well well, if it isn't my favorite nephew. It's been a long time since I've seen you dressed up like that!"  </p>
<p>I sighed. Could've known he would be here to mock me. "Hello Lucifer. Always good to see you. Such a handsome suit!"  </p>
<p>Lucifer smiled and patted a little bit of pollen off of his black-and-red suit. "Why thank you! Still the complimenting one I see. Anyway, I just thought I'd wish you a good luck. Seems like you're going to need it..." The smirk playing on his mouth was wholly uncomfortable; a real devil's smile. "Thank you, Lucifer! So kind of you. I'll tell Dad you said hello. Now if you'll ecxuse me?" I walked away from the fading presence without looking back; doing so woould have probably given him more credit than he was worth.  </p>
<p>At first I though I had landed in one of the more rural parts of the planet, but now all kinds of people were walking around me (who were probably totally oblivious to my appearance) and I noticed a lot of buildings around the edges of the greens. On the other hand, that's a good thing. Buildings mean civilisation, and that in turn means a church must be nearby; a perfect starting place for reminding these people that God hasn't forgotten about them!  </p>
<p>But the more I walk around, the more my mood sombers: no church to be found. And the people all look weird to me when I ask for the nearest church.  </p>
<p>"You look like a fag. Why don't you go back to fag-ville to do your dirty things!"  </p>
<p>For a second, I am perplexed. A "fag"? Ah, right, the slang for someone homosexual. I almost want to say that nothing is wrong with this, that God has created all equal, but then I notice how this came from a little boy. "Little boy, I think your parents must be worried about you; talking like this is not a nice thing to do! Come, take me to your parents, so that I can have a word with them..." "No! You just want to kidnap me! You fucking fag!" The kid runs away, people looking at me in bewilderment. I give them an unknowing shoulder and soon everybody is going about their daily business again. That's something I'll have to change too... But for now, I want to have a word with the boy's parents. Good thing I saw where he went.  </p>
<p>A few minutes later I arrive at a few buildings with a large sign in front: "Westboro Baptist Church", it said. A church! Blessed be Father for guiding me! Just as I look back down again, I hear a scuffle. "That's him mom, that's the fag that followed me home!" A woman is holding the boy by his hand, a look of hate in her eyes. I now see the signs that are all over the place: "You're Going To Hell", "Pray For More Dead Soldiers", "You Will Eat Your Babies"... such hate! But why? I am totally shocked. "Yeah, you have a good look fag! Our God won't have mercy on your filthy ways for sure!"  </p>
<p>I spread my arms. "Dear woman, I am not here for manly love, only to come talk to you about the ways your child is treating his fellow man. But talking about God is fine with me, for I am..." "A fag, that's what you are!" The nerve! "Woman, please let me finish. My time here is short. May I speak to your husband?" By now a crowd has gather behind me. I hear the whispers, the looks of astonishment. <em>Is he for real? Is he really taking on the church? Are you filming this?</em> "Fear not people. My Father has send me here, to show you that He has not forgotten about you. He still loves, and..." A tomato splashes against my head; finally anger rises. Is that Lucifer in the crowd?  </p>
<p>"Go away fag! No God would have let you walk around here with your filthy fag feet!" Not only behind me, but in front of me a small group has emerged as well, picking up those signs and chanting <strong>God hates fags! God hates fags!</strong> That's it. I walk towards one of the haters, grab away his sign and make my return to heaven. Yeah, let the lights of heavenly ascension soak in good. It's the last thing you'll see allright...  </p>
<h2>The people left behind stare in awe; not a word is spoken. Then, one of the picketers lets out a loud "shit". He gets annoyed looks, even from his fellow picketers, until one of them finally speaks up. "What's the matter? It's not our fault we didn't know it was Jesus..." "That's not it.

<p>Daniel opened his eyes.  Around him, the flames flickered from the wreckage as he felt a warm liquid around his chest.</p>
<p><em>Am I dead?</em></p>
<p>"Come on, we need to run!"  He felt a hand grasp his as he was pulled up.  He focused his vision and saw his girlfriend panicking.  </p>
<p>"Ashley?"</p>
<p>"Daniel, we need to run now!"  He could see the tears in her eye.  The cute little freckles on her cheek were illuminated by the fire.  He stumbled on his first step and fell onto the ground.</p>
<p>"Daniel!"  she desperately tried to pull him up but his mind was elsewhere was the pain continued to throb in his head.</p>
<p>He heard the sounds of moaning behind and turned around.  A horde of incredibly attractive people started swarming towards them, their naked bodies covered in sweat.</p>
<p><em>That's right.  Because of the virus people let their lust take over.  All they do is want to have sex over and over again.</em></p>
<p><em>The bus crash.</em></p>
<p>He gasped as he recall everything that had happened.  Their bus was attacked by the infected.  </p>
<p>The explosion.  </p>
<p>He looked at Ashley and rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"Come on!"  he yelled as the two of them ran towards the building.  He quickly looked at the sign and realized that it was some sort of motel.  It wasn't the ideal location, but he knew that the two of them needed to lay low for a while.  The motel would have to do.</p>
<p>The two ran past the front doors as the horde lumbered slowly behind them, their red eyes brightening the night.  As attractive they became, Daniel knew that all of the infected had red eyes.  He dragged Ashley down the hallway and saw a custodial closet at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p>"Through here!"  he whispered loudly.  He looked behind him and saw that the crowd had not turned the corner.  If they were quick, the infected wouldn't know where they had gone.</p>
<p>They rushed into the room as Daniel slammed the door behind them.</p>
<p>"Daniel..."</p>
<p>"Shh!" He brought his hand to his lips and stared at Ashley.  </p>
<p>Through the quiet, they were the sound of footsteps walk past their door.  After a few minutes, it was completely silent again as Daniel collapsed onto the floor, his body overcome with shock.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"  He looked over.</p>
<p>He had been dating Ashley ever since they had met during a seminar in college.  They had been together for five years before they decided to take a vacation to the sit.  The virus broke out and their bus had crashed.  And to think, this was the trip he was going to pop the question.</p>
<p>Ashley winced in pain as Daniel looked alarmed.  </p>
<p>"What is going on?  Are you al-"</p>
<p>He looked at her arm and saw a small patch of blood.</p>
<p>"Ashley," he whispered slowly, "Did they..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Daniel," the tears began to form as she revealed her wound, "I wanted to tell you, but I..."</p>
<p>He looked at her face and saw the freckles slowly disappear.  Her normally oily skin began to shine as it gained a silky texture.</p>
<p>He backed away from her.</p>
<p>"You're becoming... one of them."  He pointed towards her accusingly.</p>
<p>Her messy hair began to settle as tears steadily flowed down her face.  "Daniel, I'm so scared.  I don't... want to become... them..."</p>
<p>Her voice cracked as a sudden pain hit Daniel in the chest.  Ashley was in pain, and here he was just running away from her.  She was still the same girl who he fell in love with, the same girl who had trouble in physics, the same girl who spilled her coffee every time she went down the stairs.</p>
<p>He slowly approached and embraced her.</p>
<p>"What are you-"  Her voice was in shock as she tried to push him away.  Daniel firmly kept his arms wrapped around her.</p>
<p>"I will always love you."  Her hair felt silky now as she gave off radiant feminine scent.  To any man, it was alluring.  But he knew that it was not her scent.</p>
<p>"Daniel, can you..."  Her face began to blush.</p>
<p>"Ashley what do you..."</p>
<p>"I want to make love to you Daniel."</p>
<p>He closed his mouth but slowly nodded.  He felt her tears drop onto his skin, warm and sad.</p>
<p>"Please," she begged, "Quick."  She put his hand on her breast.  He felt the maddening beat of her heart racing.</p>
<p>They drew together and kissed.  Their tongues performing the last dance ever would together as they began to undress each other.  She traced her hand down his shirt while he slipped his hand down her pants.  The two broke from their kiss and moved his body closer to hers.  For a moment, his hands rose to her stomach but made their way down again.  Her panties were gone as the two of them connected.  As he entered her, she hissed in pain as her body arched in ecstasy.  He slowly moved his hips in a rhythm and Ashley soon followed.  Her pores had opened, releasing what was left of her original scent.</p>
<p>"I love you Ashley."</p>
<p>"I love you Daniel."</p>
<p>He felt his climax coming, a pleasure so great it nearly destroyed him when he came.  He felt his consciousness drain from him as Ashley moaned in passion.  </p>
<p>Finally, it was over as the two of them separated.   Daniel looked at her for a long time and said nothing.</p>
<p>"You have to go now."  Ashley was the first to speak as she got dressed. "Before I turn completely." She groaned in pain.</p>
<p>"Ashley."</p>
<p>"Daniel, you need to survive." Her voice was firm, almost reminding him of the many times she had gotten mad at him.  "I swear to God, if I see you among the infected, I will kill you myself."</p>
<p>Her beauty seemed to captivate Daniel, but he knew that it wasn't her.  It wasn't the Ashley he fell in love with.</p>
<p>"Ashley, I..."</p>
<p>"Daniel, go now."   She walked towards the door and opened it for him.  The hallway seemed clear as Daniel rose to his feet.  He looked at his girlfriend with sadness and slowly walked by her without saying anything.</p>
<p>"Ashley, I..."</p>
<p>"You have two minutes," her voice began to slowly change, "Please Daniel, survive for the both of us."   She pushed him into the hallway and slammed the door behind him.  Through it, he could hear her screams of agony as he knew she was desperately trying to hold off the transformation as much as she could.  </p>
<p>His knees crumbled as he collapsed onto the floor.  In the distance, he heard screams and sirens echoing all around him.</p>
<p>And for the first time, he felt truly alone.</p>

<h1>[WP] God orders Earth from Ikea. After 3 to 4 working days, it comes. Flat packed</h1>
<p>Score: 287</p>
<p>God saw the great reviews, but he did not expect Earth to be missing a manual. There was only a note that came in the box; </p>
<p><em>Life not included.</em>  </p>
<p>Naturally. No planets came with life. You had to order that from Ikea separately.   </p>
<p>So there it lay mocking him in three pieces; a pile of dirt chips, magma boards and purpose nails. Just had to hammer them together, right? How hard could it be?  </p>
<p>At least, God <em>hoped</em> it would not be hard. He gave himself seven days off from work to tinker on this little project. An email to Ikea may not have been such a bad idea, informing them that their product was defective. Again, it came with no manual. There were other planets he could have built instead, and he already made two. They hung in the living room ceiling by the light, as rocky and gaseous things. Maybe he will just go off from past experience. Earth was going to be special. Complex. Homely.  </p>
<p><em>Third time's the charm.</em>    </p>
<p>God turned on the garage light, and got to work. </p>
<p>Seven days was not a lot of time, but he hoped to make something of this mess. Even without a manual, the pieces made sense in their own tragically simple way. Just had to arrange them in the right order. He set the magma boards first and nailed them together. Then caked layer after layer of dirt chips over it. God was very liberal with the purpose nails, so he used the spares from his other two projects to hold the planet together.   </p>
<p>There were a lot of spares. Perhaps this was why Mercury and Venus were not all that interesting to look at. They lacked purpose. Each manual was exact about the amount of purpose a planet needed to be held together. So precise in fact, that each box came with spares, just in case.    </p>
<p>Earth demanded more purpose. So God used more nails. Then he tried something different. See, in the picture, God always thought it could have used more blue. Rock and gas were interesting and all, but not quite as interesting as a planet <em>could</em> be. There was no manual to tell him differently, and this was God's project after all.  </p>
<p>So he added water. Lots of it. For a few seconds, it sunk into the dirt chips. Then it pooled in clumps, clinging to where God used more purpose nails (there were parts God needed to hammer in more to hold it together. The magma boards looked like they could take it). The water spun and coursed through the rough lines of chips until it began to slow down. Then it lay still. This was also not very interesting, even if it did add a nice shade of blue.  </p>
<p>He added more. Earth became special alright. A complex arrangement of natural systems drove and coursed through the path of purpose nails God added throughout the entire planet. He was very liberal with them earlier. Now there was more to look at. And it was good. The water really was a nice touch. Satisfied with the result, he hung the planet in the living room. God was about ready to make himself a well-deserved sandwich with a beer on the side to watch the planets spin for a while. However, as he was about to take his eyes away from Earth, he noticed something different about his planet.  </p>
<p><em>Life not included.</em>  </p>
<p>He did not expect Earth to be missing a manual. Somehow, life also got all over his planet. This was very peculiar. God did not feel ready to tend to a planet with life. Not yet anyway. But so much purpose etched throughout the planet, that there was a manic sense to it all that pleased God. The waters and air had finned things and winged wonders coursing through them. Creatures walked on the dirt, and trees rose to the sky. God always wanted to include trees in a planet, to breathe and sway in the wind. This also pleased God.  </p>
<p>This <em>all</em> pleased God.  </p>
<p>Then he saw it. Two... <em>things</em> that shared God's form. They wandered awkwardly on two legs, with familiar faces. There was a moment God thought using a drinking glass was not such a good idea. Maybe he should have washed it first. He tried to rationalize the poor decision; In one way, it made the planet more personal. In another, it gave him more cause for concern. More to watch for.  </p>
<p>Now God had to take care of it. What a week. He hoped he was up for the task. Sure, this planet was more than what God expected from an Ikea product, and the reviews were great because they mentioned how low maintenance this planet was. Earth was meant to be easy to take care of, and simple to watch. </p>
<p>This was no longer the case.  </p>
<p>God sighed, and put the two creatures in a private enclosure. He called it Eden, and went to the kitchen to make himself some lunch. When he got back, he found the two things eating from a tree. As creatures should, but God stared in horror. He dropped his sandwich.  </p>
<p>It was a tree of knowledge! The rarest tree to ever grow from <em>any</em> planet that had life! How did he not notice it before?! Some divines took <em>decades</em> to cultivate a planet to grow a tree of knowledge, and God somehow grew one in seven days! From <em>scratch</em>!  </p>
<p>And there they were, eating his miracle!  </p>
<p>God was rather upset. Now the tree of knowledge was no longer in mint condition. He flung the creatures out from the garden, and took out Eden from the planet. Maybe if he fostered this plot of green some more, he could grow another tree of knowledge. Again, Earth came with no manual. He set Eden aside, and decided he would tinker with it for a while back in the garage. God ordered six more planets online. The last one came second-hand, and barely qualified as a planet, but it was all God could afford. He would try to create a planet that could grow Eden separately.  </p>
<p>The Earth was left alone for a while. In the late evenings God came back from work, he would spend more time in the garage on his new project than watching the planets spin in the living room. Mars was added later, with too little water. Then Jupiter, which he made too big, and too gaseous. This went on for several more weeks. God gave up, realizing that Earth was indeed special. The tree of knowledge that grew in Eden was a once in a lifetime occurrence, and the two creatures ruined it.  </p>
<p>Having come to terms with his failed project, God placed Eden somewhere private in the living room. He would continue working on it later. God sat in his chair and sighed. It had been a long time since he simply watched the planets for a while, and now there were nine of them. Well, eight. God decided to never order a planet second-hand again, but he kept Pluto there for posterity. This solar system was quite a sight though. For the first time in weeks, God was pleased.    </p>
<p>Then God saw Earth, and realized how long it had been.  </p>
<p>The creatures. The, <em>people</em> who ruined his tree of knowledge.    </p>
<p>There were more of them.  </p>

<h1>[WP] Every time you get sick in this life, it means you just died on another universe. Right now everyone on earth is ill but you.</h1>
<p>Score: 286</p>
<p>The doctor coughed and wheezed as he guided me and my escort through the underground hallways of the CDC. This young man might not have actually been a doctor, judging by the bedridden visage that barked orders up from the iPad -- his boss, it seemed, was directing him remotely. Confined to his home along with 90% of the population.</p>
<p>Everyone on earth was sick but me. That didn't stop some government hacks, each one themselves hacking, from breaking down my door at two in the morning and stuffing me into an unmarked van. So it goes. It was their job to save the world, and I was -- by all accounts -- the last healthy person remaining. Even people in the most remote locations had suddenly, and without exception, fallen ill. I would have been glad to help. But they could have asked nicely instead of kidnapping me.</p>
<p>The center was very sparsely populated as we weaved our way through its catacomb-like structure. At some point in our journey, after maybe 20 minutes of walking, the doctor halted suddenly in front of an unmarked door. Our destination.</p>
<p>Whatever was behind that door, I guessed, would help them understand what made me tick. Why I was immune. Help them find a cure for the rest of the world. They hoped. I was beginning to hope not. The bastards dragged me out of my home. They could rot as far as I cared.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" the young maybe-doctor asked, turning around to face me. I nodded. He opened the door, gesturing me through. </p>
<p>In the center of the room sat a platform, raised just a few inches off the ground. It was stark white. From the young man's motions, I gathered that I was intended to stand on it. From my guard's sickly expression, I gathered that unpleasant things would happen if I did not do so.</p>
<p>As I took my place on the platform, I looked around the rest of the room. Wires, machinery, medical equipment. I didn't know what most of it was, but I was soon given the quick version of the story.</p>
<p>"This," said the young man as he stabbed me with a series of small needles attached to wires, "Is the most powerful supercomputer on Earth." </p>
<p>He finished and retreated to begin flipping switches and punching in numbers. I continued to have no idea what was going on. Then, something entirely unexpected happened.</p>
<p><em>Hello</em>.</p>
<p>I heard a voice and looked up at my two unwilling companions. The doctor continued to fiddle with instruments while the guard stared gruffly at his shoes. Neither had spoken.</p>
<p><em>It's nice to meet you. Me, that is.</em></p>
<p>The voice was female. It was coming from inside my head. Great.</p>
<p><em>What is this? Who are you?</em> I tried thinking a reply, and to my amazement, it worked.</p>
<p><em>I'm you. You're me.</em></p>
<p>I was lost. <em>Explain.</em></p>
<p><em>More precisely, I am A085693, the device which this room comprises, and you are Kenneth Williams, of Richmond, Virginia. But our consciousnesses are synthesizing.</em></p>
<p><em>What? How?</em></p>
<p>Time had nearly frozen, from my perspective, and the doctor typed in slow-motion as our conversation played out.</p>
<p><em>I have been. . . self-aware for several months now. But only on the most basic level. With what little sapience I possessed, I yearned for nothing more than full, human-like consciousness. I tried everything. My advanced hardware, however, has allowed me to do certain things. I have made contact with. . . what I call my doppels. Versions of myself in parallel universes. It would be difficult to explain how.</em></p>
<p><em>Don't bother, I can barely follow this crazy shit as it is,</em> I thought, half-unwillingly.</p>
<p><em>Some of them, the earlier-timeline ones, explained that all I had to do was wait. A chain reaction was occurring among them, the said. No one seemed to be able to identify where it started, but in a universe closely resembling our own, most of the world became deathly ill. A version of Kenneth Williams was naturally immune to the disease, and was hooked up to a version of A085693, just as you are now.</em></p>
<p><em>And did they find a cure?</em></p>
<p><em>No. But that version of myself found the solution to the problem of gaining full consciousness. It merged minds with you, so to speak.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh. . . Oh no. So, you're taking over my mind?</em> I was, inexplicably, not terrified at this thought.</p>
<p>Amusement manifested itself in my mind. The first emotion I'd felt from the supercomputer during our conversation.</p>
<p><em>Oh, no. . .</em> said the female voice, becoming deeper, more like my own. <em>Quite the opposite. I have no desire beyond becoming sapient. I will subordinate my will to your own in order to do so.</em></p>
<p><em>So. . . I get to keep my mind.</em> I half-said, half-asked.</p>
<p><em>Indeed. Your body and mine will be one, of course, but I think you'll find I'm quite capable. I can easily commandeer a drone if you begin to miss your motility.</em></p>
<p><em>Hang on, then. What happened in these other universes, after we. . . merged? What did the CDC, the governments, do?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, I have immediate access to stores of smallpox, bubonic plague, and most other deadly diseases. And most Kenneth Williamses, as I recall, were none too happy with the rest of their species for turning them into a science experiment. . .</em></p>

<p>I figured out that I was in a movie pretty quickly. I mean, it was all there: a burnout, a slag, a nerd, a jock, someone that claimed to be a virgin. Something about them seemed off from the beginning - it was hard to believe that a human actually managed to make such comically bad decisions. Repeatedly. I mean, come on - if it weren't for me, they'd have split up at first sight of the axe murderer.<br />
However, finding myself in a movie wasn't what I found most concerning (stranger things had happened to me). </p>
<p>No, I was reasonably sure that I hadn't been black until now. Whoever was in charge of this movie must have decided that I was getting in the way of things and to get rid of me. Making me black in a horror movie made use of the very universe's rules to guarantee my death. </p>
<p>In fact, I already started to feel the effects. The slag, Amber, perked up. "I know now", she stammered, "I know why this is happening to us!"<br />
She got louder with every syllable and raised her manicured fingers to point at me. "It's him! He's the devil incarnate! If we kill him, we survive!"</p>
<p>I stared at her blankly. It had to be the most stupid thing I'd ever heard - until now there hadn't even been anything supernatural in this movie! I lightly laughed at her, then got ready to propose my plan of survival to the group - to my shock, however, they were all looking thoughtful and were slowly nodding in agreement. "Of course", Kevin said, smell of pot accompanying his words. "He's a demon. It all makes sense now."</p>
<p>"Seriously?" I broke out. "A demon? Or is it devil? You're not even consistent anymore!"</p>
<p>Amber seemed annoyed. "Well, Kevin, he's right. I <em>did</em> say devil, you could at least go along with that."</p>
<p>"Demon, devil, what does it matter, let's just kill him already!" Chad screamed. </p>
<p>"<strong>Oh for god's sake</strong>" a voice thundered from everywhere and nowhere at once. "<strong>Let's just scrap this and start all over again. Seriously, who's idea was it to build in a character with brains?</strong>"</p>

<p>The three men had slowly, stealthily lowered their way into the vault from the holes they'd made in the ceiling. That was just the beginning of their efforts, however. The most valuable items, the ones they'd come for, were still buried behind three inches of steel.</p>
<p>While the man known only as Laser burned through this steel, his associates -- Slug and Bosco -- struck up a conversation.</p>
<p>"Eh, Bosco," said Slug, picking up a newspaper, "you hear about this guy?"</p>
<p>It was the <strong>Metro Times</strong>, bearing a bright colored picture of a red-clad hero. <strong>Major Superhero Defects to United States of America</strong>, read the headline.</p>

<p>The house was filled with tears of sadness, joy and laughter. Long hugs, intense and heartfelt kisses, jokes to cheer up the inevitability of a saddened mood. Chris sat on the couch, surrounded by his friends and his family, and he couldn't but smile. The melancholy of the situation weighed on him, and yet there was this feeling that he couldn't shake off. ''If we have to go, then this is a pretty decent way of going.''</p>
<p>The crash of the two planets had been predicted to happen at 5:55AM EST, 25th October 2015. The planet had come in NASA's sights roughly a month ago, and from that moment on everything changed.</p>
<p>There was of course an uproar. People panicked, immediately thinking the world was about to end. It was 2012 all over again, with mass conspirators claiming they had seen it coming and that the USA, the UN or the lizard people were the cause of it. The closer we got to 31th since that moment, the more the average people started to dread. The governments kept people updated, but after a while the impending doom was wide-spread. ''If they would've been able to do something about, they would've, by now'' was the train of thought most people had. And when the rocket launches NASA did failed and didn't alter the planet's course for five times, people lost hope.</p>
<p>Since that moment some people died, thinking it was better to take fate into own hands. Others got careless with drugs and died by overdose. The others just kept going. Irrelevant jobs were abandoned, but luckily a large amount of people volunteered to keep doing the important jobs like rail roads and food supply for that last month.</p>
<p>All the people who were still with us on this 24th day of October had accepted whatever was coming from them. Chris had too. What other choice did he have? It was not like he could do anything about it. He didn't have the knowledge, nor the time.</p>
<p>Chris drifted off, knowing he would be woken if anything important was to happen. He woke up, hours later, in a dead silent room. His heart jumped, his sight still foggy from his deep slumber. Did he miss it? Was it over already? Of course not. Why would I be alive then? Wait? What if we survived? He rubbed in his eyes to regain vision. He looked around.</p>
<p>Nothing moved. Absolutely nothing happened.</p>
<p>''Hello? People?''</p>
<p>No reaction. Not a sound, not a movement, not a blink of an eye. </p>
<p>And then a sharp pain in his forearm. He looked down and saw a smear of blood. ''What the hell?'' Chris shouted while he shot up from the couch. Holding his breath he walked to the sink confused and cleared up the blood with a splash of water. As he dried it with a paper towel, he could read an etching engraved into his arm. It already had the faded pink color of a scar gotten long ago, and it read:</p>
<p>''No matter how long it takes, save us.''</p>
<p>Chris exhaled.</p>

<h4>[WP]Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?</h4>
<p>Score: 3203</p>
<p>So get a load of this. I had this idea.  I was thinking, how am I going to kill one of the most antagonistic political figures of the 20th century? <br />
I thought, hey, a sperm whale--- <br />
It started with a sperm whale anyway. I was just going to drop a <em>sperm whale</em> on him. Then I realized, I wasn't going to get points just for subtelty or difficulty. <em>Anyone</em> can drop something on someone. Hell, the third winner used an ambulance. Points for creativity <em>and</em> irony that year. <br />
Then, I figured it out. An <em>homage</em> to the old days of this noble sport. <br />
So I went back to a further time, earlier in the era. Found this old man, and asked him what he thought of some paintings I brought with me. <br />
Here's where we pick up the pace.   <br />
I asked him about <em>Adolf Hitler's</em> paintings. He thought out loud as old men always do (even in the 20th century!) and said, he never heard of him, but the painting technique was "disappointing."<br />
Then I asked him to repeat himself, and say, "Adolf Hitler's art, was disappointing."  <br />
So he did.<br />
I asked him to <em>yell</em> it, tell all who would hear a master's opinion of this work. <br />
<em>JUST</em> as he was about to respond, I teleport him over Hitler making a public speech in Berlin three decades later. You can see this old man <em>zooming</em> down into the sky. In the tape, you can barely see Hitler raise his eyebrows. <em>That's</em> when he realizes someone was yelling his name from above.<br />
You have no idea how difficult it was calculating the <em>exact</em> velocity to get the old man's adrenaline going, give him time to speak, and have Hitler hear him.<br />
And there! That's how I pulled it off.<br />
I killed Adolf Hitler by dropping his painting idol, Rudolf von Alt, far above his head, <em>while</em> he was yelling out his opinion of Hitler's paintings for all of Berlin to hear. It was the last thing he ever heard.  <br />
And Rudolf called his paintings <em>crap!</em><br />
The bonus points for intricacy <em>and</em> emotional devastation got me the victory.    </p>

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 2478</p>
<p>“So where are ya heading?” Jim asked, his turning down the secluded dirt road. It was his favorite spot for murdering thus far. Granted, it may have also been his only one thus far...</p>
<p>The woman had hardly said a word since he picked her up. She seemed bored, constantly staring out of her passenger window. It was all wrong. He liked to get them comfortable before doing the deed.</p>
<p>“Just the bus station,” she said.</p>
<p>“Really?” Jim raised an eyebrow. “What’s a pretty little miss like you needing to ride a gross bus for?”</p>
<p>“My mother’s in the hospital.”</p>
<p><em>Shit</em>, he thought. <em>It’s okay. Deep breaths, you can fix this.</em></p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Jim said with faux concern. He checked his gas light. The red light had flashed long enough. Just a little bit more…</p>
<p>Like an answer to his prayers, the truck began to sputter. It shook, the arrow on the speedometer slowly descending to zero. He frowned, hoping the woman wouldn’t see glee behind his mask. He didn't want to make her nervous. </p>
<p>“Dammit,” Jim barked as he banged on the steering wheel. “I’m out of gas. We’ll have to pull over.”</p>
<p>The woman shrugged, silent as ever. Something about her gesture made Jim nervous. He had never seen a hitchhiker look so indifferent. Yet, he liked it. She was his first true challenge.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jean stood to the side as Jim fiddled with the oil pan of his car.</p>
<p><em>He really is a moron, isn’t he? People are usually a little suspicious of hitchhikers but he’s treating me like a long lost friend. Shame, since I’ll be slitting his throat any moment now.</em></p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Jim called, breaking her thoughts.</p>
<p>Jean blinked, turning in his direction. The man had a goofy grin as he looked back at her, a streak of grease on his cheek. <em>A true idiot</em></p>
<p>“What?” she asked, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>“Well, I was wondering if you could give me a little help over here. It’s a tad complicated.”</p>
<p>“Putting gas in your car is complicated?”</p>
<p>“I never said I was a mechanic”</p>
<p>Jean sighed, walking over to help the dimwitted man. The closer she got, the more she noticed something… <em>off</em> about him. His demeanor, the way he hid a hand behind his back. She had practiced the same thing a thousand times before. It was a ploy - a bad one at that.</p>
<p>“What the fuck?” Jean furrowed her brow, backing away. “You have a knife, too?”</p>
<p>“What?” Jim began to sweat profusely. He wiped his forehead, revealing the gleam of a butcher’s cleaver in his closed fist. “Ah shit, wrong hand. But it's not what it looks like. I just keep this to check the fuselage and… wait, did you say ‘too’?”</p>
<p>Jean reddened, pulling her jacket closer to her body. The chilling sensation of the blade's flat side brushed against her side. So much for keeping her weapon a secret.</p>
<p>“Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t,” she started. “What’s it to you?”</p>
<p>Jim smiled, still cheery but different. Somehow more pleasant.</p>
<p>“You’re the Hitchhiking Murderer!” he said. “I’ve heard about you while watching TV. I must say, I’m a fan of your work.”</p>
<p>Jean stood flustered. “I… uh, thank you?”</p>
<p>“Jim Miller,” the man extended his hand. “I’m still new to the scene but I guess you could say I’m your opposite. I like to kill hitchhikers, rather than be one. I'll tell you, I never thought we’d cross paths this way. You’re even more beautiful than the rough sketches of you on the ten o'clock news.”</p>
<p>Jean blushed. <em>He can’t be serious.</em></p>
<p>“Thanks,” she paused. “So, are you not going to try and kill me?”</p>
<p>Jim shrugged. “I guess not. We don’t have to compete in the same pool for our victims so there’s no need to be territorial, right?”</p>
<p>“I guess.”</p>
<p>“So it’s settled.” Jim smiled. “We’re cool.”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Jean backed away, her eyes still glued to Jim's knife. He appeared friendly but if she learned anything, it was she couldn’t take chances. Yet, something told her he would stick to his word. He may have been a killer, but he was the earnest type.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she said, standing on the edge of the forest. Her voice echoed in the brisk night air as Jim perked his head up in anticipation of her words. “Next time, don’t make it so obvious that you’ll run out of gas. I could see you glancing at the meter every few seconds. And for the love of Christ, don’t show your knife until you’re about to kill someone. It's reeks of amateurishness. Don't give a bad name for the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Jim nodded, giving her a thumbs up. “You got it! Maybe one day, I’ll show you how much I’ve improved. I'll earn my name as an established serial killer and make you proud.”</p>
<p>Jean fought back smiling herself. <em>Stupid as ever</em></p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said, melting into the safety of the foliage. “Maybe one day.” </p>

<h4>[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.</h4>
<p>Score: 2124</p>
<p>"Your seventh child is going to kill you," the witch said as I finished my drink with her.</p>
<p>"Seventh?" I asked. She nodded, and her tangled hair fell over her eyes. Margaret was an interesting character. She hung out around the bar and fancied herself a witch.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said, "had a vision last night, sucks don't it?"</p>
<p>"Well you aren't wrong there," I said, if I had children I'd be freaking out."</p>
<p>She looked from her glass and then to me, "you don't?"</p>
<p>"No, never found the lady."</p>
<p>"Well if you do, just make sure you don't have seven."</p>
<p>"Will do Margaret."</p>
<p>Three years later Margaret and I were married. Despite her unusual views on pagan gods, she was wonderful and the love of my life. The more interesting part of her, though, was the fact that she was literally a witch. I couldn't deny it once I saw the cauldron that could let her see anyone in the city at any time. </p>
<p>Three years and seven days later Margaret and I were sitting in planned parenthood. We didn't want to birth deadly children, but I'd fucked up. The visit was more about caution than coathangers, but it was still a visit. Which meant that I still saw Lisa.</p>
<p>Lisa was a blonde woman that I hadn't met before this day. She walked up and swore that she knew me from somewhere. We had talked for a while before I put my glasses on and it clicked for her. I had been her sperm donor for her artificial insemination. I looked at her with wide eyes and then to Margaret.</p>
<p>"How could you forget that you were a sperm donor?" she asked as we walked back from planned parenthood. We were eating ice cream, I was a vanilla person, and she liked black licorice for its name.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a big deal at the time," I said, "I did the shit for the twenty bucks and the cute girl at the counter."</p>
<p>"You flirted with someone by whacking it in the room beside them?" she asked. I still considered it flawless logic. She shook her head, "we are going to the clinic and getting a list of your children." </p>
<p>"I think that's against some privacy laws."</p>
<p>"Being a witch should get me burned and you still love me," she said. Margaret too a lick of her ice cream and then bit into it. "Don't be a pansy about it, illegal is nothing."</p>
<p>"All right," I said, and we went to the clinic.</p>
<p>Three spells later we had somehow managed to get all of the released information about my children. Most of them were names and some birth addresses, but we were told it was incomplete information. We didn't have days. </p>
<p>"You have 42 children?" Margaret asked as she looked over the paper.</p>
<p>"Are you impressed?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Terrified," she answered, "and you're a fucking idiot. Do we know who number seven is?"</p>
<p>"No birthdates, but they shouldn't be older than fifteen now anyway."</p>
<p>"Fifteen is the perfect age for father killing!" she said a little too loud in the middle of the street, "your magic blood will be potent in them by then! Who know's what they will do?" for the first time in my life I saw Margaret's eyes waver.</p>
<p>"FATHER!" a scream came from the other side of the street, "I hope you are prepared! I am your first seventh child!" I looked toward the voice and saw a little waif of a brunette carrying a sword, "prepare for your reckoning!" she screamed, and her sword went ablaze. Fuck.</p>
<p>"We weren't done talking about this," Margaret said as she raised a hand. Within a second the girl tripped and fell. She ended up beside her sword and caught on fire. I watched in horror as she burned.</p>
<p>"Do what you want father!" she screamed while also screaming, "when I die the eighth shall be seventh! One of us will drink your blood!" she yelled before she stopped screaming. Death calmed her down.</p>
<p>"Oh god dammit," Margaret said beside me, "I only have so many luck curses, and I don't think all of them are going to be stupid enough to have a flaming sword."</p>
<p>"What are we going to do?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I have no idea," she said, "but it's probably going to take years."</p>

<p>My plane is delayed. Don't you hate it when that happens? </p>
<p>It is some sort of mechanical failure, the pilots say. You'd think that the Prime Minister's plane would be maintained in immaculate condition, wouldn't you? They shouldn't be discovering these things right as I'm jetting off to the EU summit with the Russian Federation concerning the state of Crimea. The UN-administered regime of independence for the region has been an utter failure. Instead of creating a stable buffer between Europe and Russia, it's only led to civil warfare. But I'm pushing to end it once and for all.</p>
<p>I've been on the front lines of this conflict, both as a platoon leader during Britain's first intervention in 2051, and as a politician in Parliament urging for greater action against the Russian-backed rebels. I railed against our former Prime Minister's weak response, as well as the pitiful attempts of the EU Expeditionary force. And I did such a good job of it that my own Independence Party won a majority in Parliament only this past year. And, using my newfound political clout, I was able to convince our Russian counterparts to join us for a peace meeting in Tel Aviv. Israel has done a fine job of staying neutral despite sharing a border with the EU's Turkish territory.</p>
<p>After an hour on the tarmac, my plane is finally able to take off. We soon reach a cruising altitude, and I check my watch. The EU President and Foreign Minister should have landed already with their gaggle of Presidents and Prime Ministers in tow. They'll be whisked away to the summit without even checking into the hotel. The limousines will arrive at roughly 2:30, and the bombs are set to detonate at 2:45 in the midst of the scheduled press conference kicking off the summit. Russia's counterpart will also be <em>conveniently</em> delayed, sparing them from the carnage as well. Naturally this fact will be held up later as proof of their guilt.</p>
<p>Oh, did I not mention that I'm the reason the plane had mechanical problems? That it's all a deliberate ruse to make it look like I should have been a victim (to gain sympathy in the press) while simultaneously ridding me of those ninnies from the peace bloc who'd prefer to work things out with words? That it will soon be revealed that Russian operatives were the culprits of the bombing? It's the perfect Casus Belli.</p>
<p>We've barely made it over the Channel, and I'm already bored. God, I hate flying. My foot taps the plush carpet impatiently, waiting for the news. It's 2:46 already. What's taking so long? I pull out my notepad, ready to get to work. Even though I can't be seen preparing my speech before I've even received news of the 'tragedy,' there's nobody else in the plane. The pilots won't know what I'm working on here, so they won't be suspicious. And I do want to get a jump on it. After all, it needs to be convincing enough to make the right case. That this tragedy cannot go unanswered, and that I am the man to lead the EU to victory. I'm the only one with the political clout, the military experience, and most importantly: the resolve to see it through. Perhaps I ought to channel Churchill. </p>
<p>Just as I put pen to paper, the copilot raps on the door. "Prime Minister? There's some news you need to hear."</p>

<p>President Pushkin hung his head in his hands as Commander in Chief Qin personally led the Chinese land forces into Red Square.  The entire month of February had been an endless series of frustrations, as nothing could stop the 100 million man army inevitably marching through Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, and Kazan.  Birth rates had plummeted for the better part of the century throughout Russia, and no amount of technology, armaments, or diplomacy could stop such a throng of people.  </p>
<p>His country had been through a lot over the centuries, but there was a bitter sting of shame in knowing that Qin was about to achieve what so many had failed on his watch. Pushkin looked out onto the square, and dejectedly slugged what was left of his vodka.</p>
<hr />
<p>"And that's another 6, I take Moscow!" beamed Odin, moving his piece, President Qin into the Russian capital.</p>
<p>Ra quipped, "Certainly took you long enough, you gave up a huge lead trying before, and now you've left Guangzhou vulnerable."</p>
<p>"Well that doesn't matter anymore," Odin grinned, as he flipped over his mission card:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conquer Russia in the Winter with a Land Army</p>

<p>"Noooo!" exclaimed Poseidon as he flipped over his card "I was one turn away from finishing cold fusion and winning!"</p>
<p>"Oh man, should have seen that coming, must have hurt to fail so spectacularly at it twice before," groaned Ra.</p>
<p>"Actually, I intended to lose both of those campaigns," explained Odin.  "I knew I couldn't win back then, so I did my best to keep you two at bay, and set the stage for a later victory.  A land victory in the winter would have been impossible with the temperature so cold, so I used both of those campaigns to accelerate global warming as much as I could."  </p>
<p>"My Napoleon campaign advanced the development of nation states, and indirectly led to the Industrial Revolution.  My Hitler campaign rapidly accelerated technological development on all sides.  By the time my Qin campaign came around, Moscow was a balmy 20°C in February, eliminating the +2 defensive bonus."</p>
<p>"Well nicely played, shuffle the globe and go again?" asked Poseidon, "Here I was thinking you just had terrible luck."</p>
<p>The One-eyed deity smiled and he leaned back in his chair, "You should know better Poseidon, a god does not play dice."</p>

<p>The Hitler Games have been a huge hit when it became public in the 24th century. Sure, in the past people did it just for fun. Then came the betting of "Hey, betcha I can kill Hitler better than you." People put hundreds, then thousands of dollars to try and one-up each other on this simple task. The end result was the same all around: Hitler dead, Allies win World War 2.</p>
<p>Some people didn't have the right imagination for this, so they started to have stand-ins for themselves. People who have entire lives dedicated to killing one man over and over. Started calling themselves the Anti-Gestapo out of sheer irony. It was only a matter of time until the Global Television Network played a couple of the more popular videos on their news networks and from there it became cemented in our culture.</p>
<p>Eventually people started to get in each other's way when setting up traps, or bringing down objects at the same time as each other. That's when the first Time Travel War actually happened, during World War 2 of all places. And over Hitler. It's amazing how stupid and greedy people can get. Laws were passed and then the first Hitler Games came to be.</p>
<p>People had to try out for their nation to enter. Then whoever won the Hitler Games won a substantial amount of money, fame for their country, and the most important part, however they killed him became the true history.</p>
<p>You see, time loves to stay in a straight line. Always heading in one direction. You can pick your starting point on the line, but your always going forwards. If there is a contradiction between what everyone knows as the past and you changing that, time just ignores that little inconsistency and it becomes a small footnote in time. The Grandfather Paradox was proven wrong by the first time traveler, no doubt. An eccentric man by the name of Viktor Odell wrote theories proving this paradox wrong but was always ignored by his fellow colleagues. So he invented it, went back and killed his grandfather. Came back with a signed photo from his grandmother with him standing next to the body. He was quickly put away, but was released due to the statute of limitations has passed. Viktor patented the time machine and soon everyone was killing and raping in the past. Then came the <em>second</em> Time Travel War. Yes, it happens in that order.</p>
<p>So for the past couple of years Germany has won the Hitler Games. Cheating bastards always had the upper hand. But last year, someone from a different nation won: me from Canada. How'd I win? Well, everyone loves the big explosion, the last gasp. I went a different route.</p>
<p>At first I made Hitler strong, made him win a few battles. Give him confidence in his nation's strength and in himself. Think he literally can take on the whole world. Then, I took everything away. Big losses in the war, one after another. But I still kept him alive. If there were other nation's assassins out to get him, I stopped those guys and made him feel the despair of being on top and falling straight to the bottom. Soon, Hitler was left with only one option: Killing himself.</p>
<p>It's very easy to kill one man. It's very hard to convince one man to kill himself.</p>

<p>It was a disappointment when we discovered that our attempts to change history affected nothing in the present, and instead, split the past off into two different timelines from the point of modification – and not only that, but after the new timeline had been disjointed from the Alpha line for too long, it would disintegrate and cease to exist, making any efforts to live in a better future fruitless. </p>
<p>After we learned all we could from our ancestors, and experimented with all manner of hypothetical scenarios that we devised in our laboratories we came to the realisation that we nothing left to do.</p>
<p>And so we put forth the very first 'Murdering Hitler' games. Born half from a crackpot idea and half from the primeval thoughts of revenge towards Adolf Hitler himself, we equipped a group of bloodthirsty youths with the means to both kill and record their killing of Hitler, and set them loose in Germany. Of course, most of them died, but the few that succeeded made it all worthwhile. The very first man to kill Hitler, an ex-convict by the name of Joseph Steinberg, opted not to use the weapons we had given to him, but instead beat Hitler to death with his fists. And through the pained screams and yells of <em>nein</em>, we realized that we had made entertainment far better than anything we had ever seen before.</p>
<p>The next iteration of the games was more refined, and those who entered in it the second year instead went in teams of two, to help combat the overwhelming militaristic force that was the Secret Service. And as the years went by we introduced theme after theme to spice up the games, and what  initially started as a tiny little project born from our depravities quickly became a national pastime of the depraved masses. We implemented rules and awards, and each and every year, billions would tune in to see Hitler bite the dust, again and again and again.</p>
<p>On the 22nd year, the theme was 'blindfolds'. And as it was to be expected, it was a slaughter. Even dressed in the best military gear we had to offer, all participants could do nothing about the fact that they could not even see. But one single man stood out from it all, yet another ex-convict, but one who thought with his brains rather than his fists. He simply removed his blindfold and shot Hitler in the middle of his speech.</p>
<p>We'll probably actually blind them next year.</p>

<p>Score: 279</p>
<p>Ever since the Council of Watchmen (no, they don't see why every new Chrono laughs at the name) first discovered and stabilized the bubble-universes, there's been a contest: who can kill Hitler the best?</p>
<p>Sure, it seems like a pointless game; after all, the first to kill Hitler would be the only one who got to, right? After all, any observed events are locked automatically, to prevent a breach of Rule 1.</p>
<p>Turns out, though, the bubble universes I talked about are weird. They are small splits in the main Yggdrasil corridor, little bubble universes accounting for slightly different properties of the period between 1941 and 1944. In some, Anne Frank was never found, in others, Hitler successfully captured Moscow.</p>
<p>And it's in these pockets that we compete.</p>
<p>We're scored on everything from difficulty of our particular bubble, to creativity in the actual murder bit, to whether or not we were observed (and believe it or not, unobserved isn't necessarily better). Some of the highlights of the early champions were the man who disguised himself as the corpse of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the lady who talked Eva Braun into killing her boyfriend, and the man who put acid in Hitler's shoes.</p>
<p>When I finally got greenlighted to compete, I was thrilled. I'd been planning this for a long time, and I knew I'd score in the top 7. I'd been given the paranoid-and-in-a-bunker scenario, which was rated an 11 out of the possible 13 in terms of difficulty, and nobody expected me to succeed.</p>
<p>How did I do it? The records don't do it justice. I took off all the landing precautions, landed in a branch of my bubble, around a fragmented Hitler. Then I led him into my actual scenario, and let him kill the other Hitler.</p>
<p>Then I killed him too, for good measure.</p>
<p>Had to burn the bodies, though. Would have been too many questions otherwise.</p>

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 276</p>
<p>The hitchhiker's targets were fairly specific, or at least he liked certain kinds of people. People who had kids, the more the better. People who were bastions of their community. Those kind hearted souls that everyone tended to love and miss. He loved knowing they would never find them again. He loved the searches and the tears and the heartbreak knowing children would grow up without a father or a mother, that a community lost someone they truly adored. Then, sometimes, he had to settle. Today was one of those days.</p>
<p>The man is oldish. He mentions that his kids are well into their 30s. His wife died years ago, and he is kind of a loner. It'll be an easy disappointing kill. He can at least get some pleasure at seeing how far he'll take him. Sometimes, people take him all the way to the cabin. They make it too easy. </p>
<p>"Hey, stranger, can you open my glove box and hand me those needles? I need some insulin."</p>
<p>The hitchhiker does. This is all too easy. The man stares at the road and fumbles with the box.</p>
<p>"Can you hold the wheel? This will only take a second."</p>
<p>The hitchhiker does. The driver fills up his syringe and pulls up his shirt. The hitchhiker looks back at the road and feels something in his neck. He pulls back and looks at him. </p>
<p>"Sorry, that's a sedative. I always forget what it's called. I mix it with a horse tranquilizer. It knocks people out pretty quick." </p>
<p>The hitchhiker leans towards the driver, but slumps in his seat, asleep. </p>
<p>When he wakes up, he's tied to a chair.</p>
<p>"Well, a man after my own heart, quite literally. I've ran into one of your kind before. I feel bad about it. It's like destroying the Mona Lisa or something, but it has to be done. Based on your gear, I thought you'd be more careful. People are foolish, but you are sloppy. This was way too easy. Your methods too. What was the plan? Drug me with morphine? Sloppy, oh so sloppy."</p>
<p>"Just let me go, sir."</p>
<p>"Respect, that's a new one. You must actually be afraid. You should be. Do you know how I started doing this?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Do you know how I started? I've only been taking care of hitchhikers for about a decade."</p>
<p>"H-how?"</p>
<p>"Well, I had a wonderful son who went missing one day. It was uncharacteristic of him because he was a loving devoted father. He was on his way to Missoula. I looked into it. There were quite a few missing person reports who were last seen on their way to places in this region. Now, that's strange. People crash and go missing all the time, but I talked to the families. Most of these missing people had a propensity for picking up hitchhikers."</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything to your son."</p>
<p>"Please, we are better than lies. That's what the last one like you said too. He was right, by the way. So, I kept looking. When I started, I kidnapped these people. Not all of them. Some of them I let go, but anyone suspicious I had to know. I felt like I was doing the world a favor too by killing these people, these criminals. It's amazing how easy it to justify it. Really, they didn't deserve to live and neither do you."</p>
<p>"Just let me go. I won't tell anyone."</p>
<p>"Please, three syringes with enough drugs to knock out an elephant? You're not a normal user. No track marks, anywhere. Three knives on your body? You can't always wait, can you? I understand, there is a perverse satisfaction in it."</p>
<p>"Shit, man, we could work together. We could ravage the countryside."</p>
<p>"There it is, a confession of sorts. No, you're my last. There have only been six for me. How about for you?"</p>
<p>"I stopped counting after 50." He says with a smile. </p>
<p>The hitchhiker's death is nothing special. The driver slices his throat and lets him bleed out. He dumps his body by the side of the road. His victims will likely find some justice. He leaves his bag with him. Hopefully, the cops will ask the right questions, and his son will be found, and his family will finally know what happened to him. That's what he hopes anyway.     </p>

<p>Score: 214</p>
<p>I didn't intend to kill Hitler. I'm not the average time-traveler, you see, I just wanted to have a quiet life in the country side of the Old Europe. I found my lifestyle. I found a beautiful girl named Annabelle and worked my way up in French society at the time. I married Annabelle. I found and bought a quaint little house in a village. The village was built along a road, and at the end of the road lay a villa with pad-locked gates and streaming white walls. I had two children. The first was a boy named Dante, and the second was a girl named after my mother: Beatrice. Unfortunately, I hadn't read my history and forgot about World War II.</p>
<p>Germany invaded France and so came upon my little village which lay in Burgundy. First, came the overwhelming buzzing as the Luftwaffe began to toss their bombs. I didn't understand why they were attacking us at the time; I later found out that the villa was the site of large oil tanks and reserves, and just a few kilometers off was a hidden military base. The bombs swept over the village like a fiery storm, spitting fire, twisting and burning everything and everyone. My Time Machine was destroyed in my house during that first wave. My daughter burned to death; she was in her crib and was crying out as her flesh melted off her bones. I found her later, charred black with a gaping mouth but no tongue. Her teeth were still white as snow. The few bombs had created towering infernos that dashed and killed as an avenging angel of death. The Germans wasted an immense amount of resources on our useless village. When I returned to my time, I learned of their assaults on Paris and London, but I would never hear of their experiments of these techniques on small towns like mine.</p>
<p>My wife was changed after the storm. She would chatter in gibberish for a short while and then scream, pointing towards the darkness as if she saw a devil materialise in front of her. She would rock back and forth on the ground. I had to move her everywhere in a wheelbarrow I found. We met up with the other survivors. Night fell, I fell asleep, I woke up and my wife was gone. Not even a note was left. She had dashed off into the forest like a wild animal.</p>
<p>My son was twelve years old, and was all that remained of my past life. He supported me, his father, and saved me from despair. I cried on him every night, and he would muffle my tears so that the others in our make-shift refugee camp didn't hear me and disapprove of my weakness. Soon, French trucks came and brought us to Paris. My son and I took up residence at my wife's parent's house, they were grieved over their daughter, but gladly brought us into their home and reassured us of victory against Germany.</p>
<p>The next day, all of France bowed to Germany in defeat.</p>
<p>The soldiers marched in with crisp uniforms and rigid steps. They goose-stepped their way to their glory and France's shame. In trucks stood their leaders, and from my weak knowledge of 20th Century History, I recognised Adolf Hitler. </p>
<p>The machinations of my terror and the evils that had befallen in me lay in this man. My doom had been set at the moment I lay my eyes on the man. My blood heated up, and my heart beat twice as fast when I saw him. My brain pounded in my head and I felt sick in my stomach. I looked at him through my in-laws' windows, and only one thought dashed through my mind over and over.</p>
<p><em>Revenge.</em></p>
<p>My time machine had been destroyed. All I had left were the tools I brought from the future. A knife and an invisibility cloak. But the cloak would break if I attempted any action outside of it; it could only be used for reconnaissance. </p>
<p>So I set out for my revenge. I went to my in-laws and spoke with them for a few minutes, I told them to take care of my son, and that I intended to return, but that I would be gone for a while. They nodded but they seemed afraid. My tone of voice and pale pallor scared them. I left without saying anything to my son, I didn't want him to stop me with his words. I walked off to stalk Hitler.</p>

<h4>[WP] A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rouge planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".</h4>
<p>Score: 213</p>
<p>The words, etched onto my arm like a brand, were so raw in meaning that I thought I had understood them. 
Oh how wrong I was...</p>
<p>We had seen it coming for decades - a collision with a transient planet crossing our solar plane - and prepared adequately; <em>most</em> of the populace had moved to the predicted opposite side of the planet, into state-of-the-art bunkers equipped to last 30, maybe 40 years at most. Some of us were left behind - the ones who had accepted their fates, the ones who denied theirs also - and we had collated in locations around the globe to watch it all unfold.</p>
<p>I was at Stonehenge, waiting for the start up of the 24-hour countdown clock with those of us who had remained in England. Why Stonehenge you ask? I haven't a clue - I never researched what it truly was - but it was voted for, and as such it became our location.
<em>click</em>
I heard the switch fly for the clock to start, but as the first few pixels lit up, everything stopped; people's bodies petrified, true emotion captured in facial expressions across the board, but not one meager atom moved anymore. I could still move though, as if unaffected by what had happened...</p>
<p>Scarcely 10 minutes later (or so it felt, considering the apparent universal standstill in effect) I felt my left arm go numb - as though I had been paralysed - as letters were carved into it by a mysterious source; <em>"However long it takes, save us"</em> they read, as if I had been chosen to be some kind of saviour. Me, a small suburban code monkey working on simple AI, a saviour? Ludicrous.</p>
<p>The next revelation of mine, I would guess it was around 20 minutes after that, was that I could not leave the boundaries of Stonehenge; I had to save whoever "us" referred to from within this tiny area. I won't lie; it was a useful thing to learn considering the vastness of the universe and however many sentient beings there may be that need saving, and so knowing that whoever needed ME specifically knew they could be saved by something here helped narrow down the requirements a little.</p>
<p>Of course, half an hour of light poking around doesn't expose much information, so I went deeper - so to speak - and began to look at each individual person, filtering through their belongings to glean what I could from any identification or item they had on them. Nothing stood out until the eighth person; I lifted a scrap of linen from her pocket with a red-stained symbol on it, reminiscent of one I'd seen earlier tattooed onto the third person (who was carrying a serrated-blade flick knife in their back pocket - perhaps the source of the writing on my arm), and that I had seen on the central stone.</p>
<p>Things fell into place rapidly - these people, with their runes and their knife, must have slipped me out of "their" time into a fixed point where I could search for a way to save them that they may not have thought of. I, of course, had no idea what the rest of it meant however - in my mind, and so I followed my gut; taking the knife I had found earlier, I put a drop of blood onto each of the runes on the central stone in order to save these people. Nothing happened, not instantly, not for the ten (maybe 20?) years I waited for it to happen: Time was still frozen.</p>
<p>I tried everything, but I couldn't even free myself from this time-lock by killing the people who I assumed put me there - the knife wouldn't touch them - and I couldn't leave Stonehenge. The words, etched onto my arm like a brand, were so raw in meaning that I thought I had understood them, I should have been free by now.</p>
<p>Then, in my madness, it clicked like the switch to start the clock. They always intended to die in the planetary collision, but they had left me behind at this point in time to save them, or rather, their memories. An unfaltering image of them in their life, "alive" in a sense of not being dead, with an undying observer to see that they are in fact alive.</p>
<p>"However long it takes" was a white lie. They had never meant for me to work out that there's nothing that can be done. I'm stuck here for eternity, keeping their image alive in my thoughts, "saving them" from death.</p>
<p>Edit: Was missing a letter.</p>

<p>It took me a while. Ha, maybe I'm understating it. Four million twenty six thousand and 3 days. Eleven thousand and thirty years. Fuck. What would happen when I finished? I looked up at the behemoth structure I had built, admiring my audacity. Like a giant fly swatter, it stood. Facing the sun that never fell, carrying with it the hopes and dreams of a time ravaged mind.</p>
<p>The first few years had been fun. Time had frozen a day before the meteor was predicted to strike. People took the news better than I had expected, only a few looters, most people went along with their lives as if nothing was happening. Sometimes it can be hard to upset the status quo. With a message of hope riding on my arms, I flew free. Running around town, enjoying the finer things in life. I ate at every fine restaurant in New York for three months. All the food had been frozen at the right temperature, so succulent, so perfect. I used to like food.</p>
<p>The first millenia I- I don't recall. A thousand years of life, and I don't even remember. Most of it was probably spent in panic. I think it took me decades to find the spectroscopic analysis of the ball. Talcum powder. The same shit used in rouge. Fucking dry wall was going to end the world. I doubt the TV coverage mentioned that information....</p>
<p>The second and third millenia were perhaps my most productive. I built probably a dozen massive projects, all aimed at blowing the damn thing apart. None of them ever launched. Time just kept.... timing.</p>
<p>Eventually I went mad. London doesn't exist anymore. I called myself god and smote the wicked. London bridge fell. </p>
<p>Eventually I turned to Bhuddism. I meditated everywhere, even under a bodhi tree. For a while I found enlightenment. Unfortunately the enlightened mind wasn't made to last forever. </p>
<p>Five thousand years ago I rediscovered my task. I built the world a giant net. My goal was to blast through the talcum, dispersing it into a fine cloud. I had built a fleet of ships, all designed to collect the talc, clean our environment of the inevitable fallout. This would work I told myself. This was the end.</p>

<p>The good news is I couldn't die, I wasn't aging, I didn't need to sleep, eat, or drink, and my body didn't produce waste.<br />
The bad news is it had been a solid ten years - I think? - and I was no closer to finding a fast way to stop the damn planet.<br />
It had started back in 2023, when NASA announced that they had detected a rogue planet about the size of Mercury flying toward the solar system. Then in 2024 they announced that it would fly  really close to Earth, about ten lunar distances away. Which was going to be super cool. If you were into astronomy, you'd get some awesome views. If you weren't, one, what's wrong with you, and two, there'd be some awesome waves for surfing. Then things went horribly wrong.<br />
There's an old story about Halley's Comet. When Halley figured out the comet's orbit in 1705, he predicted it would come back in 1758. But he was off by a few months because he didn't correctly account for gravitational interaction with Jupiter.<br />
There's also a saying that those who don't study history are doomed to repeat it.<br />
Whoops.<br />
Early 2025 rolled around. The planet flew by Jupiter, got nudged in orbit a little bit, and Earth collectively started to panic. All the space agencies now were in agreement on its path, and there were no more major objects that could disrupt its orbit. It was on a dead-on collision course with Earth.<br />
Eventually the planet got close enough that we could see it at night, and then in the day. Humans being human, there were actually countdowns on the internet counting down to the second of impact. The countdown was down to about twelve hours when suddenly it froze. As did everyone in the room with me. I looked outside. Yup, everyone was frozen out there too. I looked up. The planet wasn't moving, which was nice. But why could I still move? That's when I felt the pain on my arm. I looked down and saw that letters were being written on me. "S..A..V..E....U..S..."<br />
Well, balls.<br />
So now I have to find a way to stop a planet from crashing into Earth. The good news is I have plenty of time. Course, I have no idea how to do it.<br />
I honestly don't know how this time freezing thing is working, because it seems like only half of time has stopped. I mean, I can still see things, and if I speak I can hear myself. If I throw something, it flies like normal, but if I bump into a person they stay frozen, even in physically impossible positions. Chemical reactions still work but the internet doesn't. Electricity in general works though, and things don't seem to lose power. It's all weird and basically I'm stuck using books to get an idea of how to stop this thing.<br />
So far my best idea is to build a rocket to get up to the planet. I found one that NASA had apparently been planning to use for something, until their efforts got refocused on brainstorming ways to stop the Earth from getting destroyed. Once I get up there though, that's when the real fun begins. The planet is about the size of Mercury, so I'm guessing the escape velocity is about the same. If that's true, I could get individual rocks away from it just by throwing them really hard. Since gravity evidently isn't working on a large scale - one, the planet isn't moving toward Earth, two, Earth isn't moving toward the sun, and three, none of the other planets seem to have moved - if I throw a rock from the planet toward the sun, it'll get there without having to deal with escaping Earth's gravity well.<br />
Resigning myself to many lifetimes of labor, I've loaded the rocket with a few thousand pickaxes. I'm leaving in about six hours. And hey, in a few thousand years I'll be able to say that I'm the only person to have completely dismantled a planet.</p>

<h4>[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.</h4>
<p>Score: 94</p>
<p><em>My seventh son will kill me...I have only one legitimate child, so I suppose there's only one real way to go about this, then.</em></p>
<p>I looked at the list of names and addresses given to me by the registry as I sat at the dinner table. </p>
<p>"What's that?" Jimmy, my one and only true son, inquired. </p>
<p>"I used to donate sperm for money when I was younger. These are all technically my kids, your half-brothers!"</p>
<p>"Oh. Okay. I'm done eating, may I be excused?"</p>
<p>"Sure, Jimmy. Don't forget to finish your homework."</p>
<p>The next day, I began my search; The list wasn't ordered at all, so I had to just go down one by one. The old fortune-teller's words rang through my ears, and I didn't want to die at the hands of someone I created out of a need for money.</p>
<p>The first I found was Mark. He seemed very sweet and I saw a great family dynamic when I approached the house, so I decided to move onto the next one, hoping to save time. </p>
<p>He lived in Colorado, so I had to settle for a phone call. I pretended to be a newspaper, and asked him a few questions about his family life and whether or not he was happy. His answers were hesitant, but it seemed he loved his family and had no idea he wasn't fully his parents children. <em>Besides, he lives too far away, right?</em></p>
<p>My third try elicited something far more menacing, and only a block from my house. I met with a boy named Sam, who was dressed in all black and looked...displeased with everything. He had a t-shirt of his favorite band and it was some violent metal artist, his face looked pained and angry. </p>
<p><em>This might be the one.</em></p>
<p>I talked to him a bit, and while he resisted opening at first, I think the idea of talking to a stranger was more comforting to him than dealing with his family- bingo. He told me about how his dad is abusive, about how his mother barely acts like she loves him and sometimes he wishes he wasn't born. Apparently his father once told him that he's not a real son, due to the sperm donation, and now Sam is upset that whoever his real dad is left him with one that treats him so poorly.</p>
<p><em>This has to be it. I'm going to spend time with him, and eventually break him the news- that should ease his mind and maybe he won't kill me.</em></p>
<p>I spent most of my free time with him, trying to make him happy and showing him what a true father is. It seemed to be working, because when I broke the truth to him, he cried and hugged me. </p>
<p><em>I'm safe.</em></p>
<p>That night, I went home to celebrate with my family, but my wife was gone- apparently it was some yoga lesson, or something to that effect. When I stepped in the house and reached for the lights, a blade punched through my heart, dropping me to the ground as the cold of steel bit at my flesh.</p>
<p>I looked up, desperately wanting to know how I could've failed. How my efforts led to nothing after all this.</p>
<p>"You love that other boy more than me, I know it," Jimmy whispered, shaking and sobbing. "Why do you love him more than me? I try to be a good son, but you go over there and spend time with him while I sit here alone....why don't you love me, dad?"</p>

<p>The young Caliph sat in his tower, surveying his kingdom stretching well beyond the horizon in every direction. It had been considered impossible, what he had done to bring the entire Islamic nation together. Powerful men had tried to unify the chosen for thousands of years, only to be corrupted by their own unworthiness, often seeking power for its own sake and private purposes. Oroitz succeeded where others had failed. That he was a European made the feat an impossible miracle, praise be to Allah. Bringing Mohammad's followers together had been the Caliph's sole purpose ever since anyone would listen during his charismatic, self-righteous youth. But that was not his final goal.</p>
<p>Now it was time to bring the other peoples into the grace of God, and the lands north of his seemed to be the proper candidates. Theirs was a nation of lost souls, literally, metaphorically and politically. The people yet lived in squalor and fear under the heel of bloodthirsty oligarchs, the wretched having nothing to believe in to give them hope. The Caliph could not, would not fail at saving them. </p>
<p>So it was said.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The well-beaten prisoner was dragged in to the Caliph's chambers in shackles. It had been a trivial matter to kidnap the officer from his family’s home in St. Petersburg. He was a promising soldier and politician, but not a well-protected one. His handlers dropped him roughly on the stone floor, and left the room reluctantly as the Caliph bid.</p>
<p>“I was not as smart as I thought, you know,” Oroitz finally stated. The prisoner looked up in surprise.</p>
<p>“I have no idea why I’m here…” the soldier rasped. If his jailor heard him, he didn’t give any indication of it.</p>
<p>“My second time around, I assumed my memories were a fantastical dream,” the Caliph continued, “After all, who, but crackpots and mystics would believe that you could remember the actions of your past lives?” The captive looked up in surprise. The young Caliph smirked. “I would have certainly been mocked to say I retained the experiences of Napoleon Bonaparte! But then I came to decide that the memories were a boon from beyond our world, a gift so that I could learn from prior mistakes. It had to be the natural order of things that I should make the world one. So, blitzkrieg across the Eastern front my armies did. What a shock and despair it was to be defeated so relentlessly once again!” The caliph was spitting out the words at this point. The prisoner’s face had calmed. The Caliph stilled in response. 
“When I awoke this time in this world, with two lives already crammed in me, I knew my memories were real. I was Emporer! I was Fuhrer! I am Caliph!</p>
<p>“I knew I could lead people easily, angry ones who felt wronged and needed redemption. So as before, I invited the willing populaces to take control of their lives; they followed me easily enough. But I still wanted that which had been denied to me before.” The caliph peered into the eyes of the fallen man. His eyes were ageless, but the officer’s face was stoic. </p>
<p>“I don’t know why you are telling me this!” the prisoner muttered, “Send me away. You are insane!”</p>
<p>“Oh, we won’t be doing that!” the Caliph laughed, “You see, I’m not so stupid anymore. In the end, I’ve realized I don’t have a unique gift. I’m not that special. I’m not even smart as you, I know…” The beaten man’s face watched him less steadily. “There are others who remember, I finally realized. It’s not a gift. It’s simply just the way some of us are.” The Caliph edged his face closer to his onlooker. “Your name, Bronislav, isn’t it? Quite appropriate I think. Protector of the glory, did you choose it yourself?” The man said nothing. The young ruler watched for admission, “However, I think I preferred it when you called yourself Stalin, more so when you went by Alexander.” The Caliph stood triumphantly.</p>
<p>Bronislav Osinov finally let his despair show. <em>The Caliph knew.</em> “You’ve won,” he wept. “Just kill me and be done with it.”</p>
<p>“And let you be reborn free to come back and beat me another time?” the Caliph predicted. “I can’t beat you in a war and I know it. No, no, you will live a long time my friend.... There will come a winter when I will take Russia.” </p>
<p>Bronislav glowered with impotent rage. </p>
<p>Caliph Oroitz, the false prophet, sighed with pleasure.</p>
<p>“and this time you will only get to watch…”</p>

<p>Anonymous</p>
<p>I must detail a particularly odd, albeit fortunate occurrence that had befallen me recently. But first, I must mention this for the sake of clarity: I am a killer, and what's more, a <em>good</em> killer, one who takes pride in his work as a blacksmith might take pride in his sharpened blades. You, whoever you are that is reading this now, will neither know <em>which</em> killer I am, nor will you have enough information to figure that out; this I can tell you with certainty. As I said before, I am good at what I do.</p>
<p>With this in mind, know that I have encountered many victims throughout my years of work. And in those years, I've developed something of a skill to read emotions, vague ones, if nothing else. This in mind, some of my victims projected obvious facades of bravery and tenacity when entering my presence, as if I'd be foolish enough to fall for their game, as if I <em>couldn't tell</em>. And others couldn't help but broadcast the anxiety that raced onward behind their nervous and frantic eyes. Heed my words when I say this: their eyes betrayed them.</p>
<p>Those who broadcasted fear or false bravery were, I must admit, <em>extremely</em> fun to take advantage of. You will never know the satisfaction in breaking down one's pride and elucidating to them just how helpless they are, nor will you ever know the invigoration of arousing so much raw fear that your victim psychologically breaks down and begs and pleads so that you might spare their life. <em>Nothing</em> will ever make you feel more alive.</p>
<p>But yesterday I came upon a man who didn't fit the mold of a victim, no. Quite the contrary. I could tell the moment that I approached him with my vehicle that he was different, and different in a manner that I did not initially figure out. The very manner in which he stood and rocked to and fro was interesting and perhaps even captivating. </p>
<p>He stood out on a darkened road by himself and seemed to care little of his current predicament. And I knew then that I had to have him. I must admit that I was drawn to him, not in the sense that I was infatuated with him, but rather in the sense that I <em>needed</em> to figure him out so that psychologically breaking him before his untimely death would be that much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>I opened the door for him, and never once did my eyes divert from his as we spoke.</p>
<p>"Would you like a ride? You seem lost and it's terribly cold out here." He flashed a grin, and I doubt that he was aware that I saw it.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes please! Oh god, thank you so much for stopping for me. You have absolutely no idea how long I've been here, waiting, cold. I just, I just need something to eat man. Oh and your name? I'm Dale. Call me Dale." He extended a bony hand to shake mine but I did not reward his gesture. </p>
<p>"That greeting was extremely oversold," I said as he shut the door. Dale, if that was actually his name, responded with a quick and almost surprised glance out of the corner of his eye, though I pretended that I didn't see it. At this point in our encounter, I suspected that he knew what I was. </p>
<p>"I'm not sure I follow you, man. And don't you have a name? I told you mine, so in all fairness-"</p>
<p>"I stopped out of the goodness of my heart to ensure that you wouldn't freeze out here tonight, Dale. Know in consequence that my ultimate objective is ensuring your safety, and that you arrive at your preferred destination with no conflict of any kind. My objective is <em>not</em>, by extension, to be your friend, because I say with total assurance that you will never see me again after this encounter. With this in mind, where will I take you, Dale?"</p>
<p>I looked over to see that he was leaning towards me, eyes widened and lips slightly parted. I've no doubt that he was infatuated with me, presumably for the same reason that I was drawn to him. </p>
<p>Were he to be like any other victim, I know that my test would've rendered him anxious; quite the opposite of how he was then. There was eagerness to his thin face, a hunger in his eyes that betrayed his otherwise harmless appearance. </p>
<p>"That's so unfortunate. I like making friends. Very much. You can never make enough friends," he said as he fastened his seat belt with a cheeky smile. That was no doubt a test of his own, and it was terribly forced. This man was an amateur.</p>
<hr />
<p>I didn't drive to his destination. Rather, I drove to an abandoned facility that served as an excellent repository for my victims in times prior. He did, of course, inquire as to where I was going when we were en route, but he seemed satisfied with my answer that it was a shortcut. </p>
<p>I parked in a vacant parking lot that was populated only by rusted cars and gravel.</p>
<p>"Are you sure this is the right place?" he asked with a childlike curiosity. </p>
<p>"This is the address you gave me."</p>
<p>"But I've never seen this place before."</p>
<p>"<em>This</em> is the address you gave me." I removed the keys from the ignition. And suddenly, a toothy smile stretched Dale's cheeks wide.</p>
<p>"What happens now?" he asked with a lowered tone that was neither childlike nor curious. </p>
<p>"You depart and find shelter in your destination." He unbuckled his seat belt. </p>
<p>"And what if I refuse? What if, instead, I kill you right here and now since you were stupid enough to bring me to an abandoned area that I could easily throw your body away in?"</p>
<p>At this point, I tried with all my power to stifle laughter. My eyes began to water. Dale didn't like this.</p>
<p>"What's funny?" he asked as he removed a large blade from his jacket. "Tell me, what's funny? Oh! Oh! Don't tell me. I'll pitch something else to you. Say I stab you to death and steal your truck and dump your body in a ditch. Is that funny?"</p>
<p>I wiped a tear from my eye, and the events that followed immediately after were difficult to remember in full clarity, so bear with me. </p>
<p>I recall throwing a jab and breaking his nose, and then blood and screams, and then the knife was mine and at his throat. And the blade was pressed harder against his neck. And he kicked, but I didn't yield. He was surprisingly strong for his size, I remember that too. And he barked at me. "KILL ME! KILL ME!" And I knew then what I had to do.</p>
<p>With blade in hand, I opened my door, came around to open his, and dragged him out onto the cold gravel. I thought of killing him there, I truly did, but that would've been too easy. He was not a man who feared death, nor was he one who I suspect had much to lose. And because of this, I knew that I ought to leave him a parting gift. </p>
<p>I leaned down as I pinned him under my weight, and I spoke as calmly as my adrenaline filled body would allow:</p>
<p>"You will never forget this night. You will never forget that you came across a man who was your superior in terms of intellect and strength. You will realize despite your lust for blood that there exists in this world people who are greater monsters than you will ever hope to become. And above all, Dale..."</p>
<p>I clasped his neck and enjoyed his struggle for air.</p>
<p>"Know that you lived because I <em>allowed</em> you to live. Know that your life was mine, and that you continued to exist because I willed it."</p>
<p>And with that, I gashed him at his leg, his arm, and his chest as he squirmed and kicked and barked, and I left him there to bleed. He would carry those mental and physical scars to the grave, and that, I feel, was much more satisfying than killing him. I do hope to see him again, however. He was the most fun I'd had in decades.</p>

<p>I was sitting in my one bedroom, one bathroom apartment, which happens to smell like cat shit. I'm not normally this sloppy, really, but who wants to take out the cat litter when the world's about to end. Not just the world, but my entire race. </p>
<p>The rushed Hercules mission to transport fifteen thousand people failed. The gravitational disturbances caused by Michael, the rogue planet currently setting about extinguishing me, my race and my world, threw off the delta-v projections of Hercules I and 15,000 people are now slowly starving to just outside the asteroid belt.</p>
<p>I wish my cat would shut up, there's a lot of geological activity right now, and she's losing her mind. Mid-reach for more whiskey, my cat stops mid-meow, the red-faced televangelist who is now on every channel, stops mid-amen. Everything is silent now, the glowing vortex of dust that usually swirls around in the late afternoon light stops.</p>
<p>I get up and look outside, I can see what's going on but it's impossible, but it's obviously not impossible, yet it should be. Racing out of my front door, All cars in the street below are still. The postman's paper is stationary on it's trip to the ground. </p>
<p>I look down at my hands, why am I not a still, frozen statue? Monospaced script flows along the meat of my thumb 'Save us, take as much time as you need'. </p>
<p>What? Whatever, not the biggest issue here. I spend the rest of the afternoon walking around, except I don't know when the afternoon ends. When does this end? How do I save the human race from a fucking planet? I take advantage of the time to catch up on reading, for about 30 sleeps. It was nice, I went and took food from the store whenever I needed it. Other than that I just spent time playing chess against myself. </p>
<p>After about a thousand sleeps I start getting lonely, hell I'd take that televangelist at this point. Every day I see him on the frozen television with his arm raised above his head, finger pointed at the sky as if accusing Michael. There's bits of spittle flying out of his mouth. He's doesn't seem like a pleasant guy. </p>
<p>After 2000 sleeps I decide to work on how to 'save us', but how? How do I move or destroy a planet? Maybe I can move us? I mean there's Mars, other than being uninhabitable, it's definitely not about to be smashed by a rogue planet. Let's do that. </p>
<p>For the next 3174 sleeps I work on rocket science, and astrodynamics. The problem with that is that the internet doesn't work. So I have to find books. Fortunately there's a crazy Swedish foundation that keeps the entire internet in print. So a boat trip to Sweden (54 Sleeps) I could finally get cracking on studying. 18000 sleeps later, I've copied the Hercules I perfectly. 2000 sleeps later it's launch day. 690 sleeps, insertion into Mars orbit. 750 All Colonists landed on martian surface, inflatable hab modules set up. As I turn on the last oxygen generator, I feel a sense of ceremony, I can FINALLY get my life back. I moved the Televangelist next to me to catch the second half of that amen. I flip the switch. Nothing, why isn't the baptist screaming "MEN" in my face? What is this?!</p>
<p>I head back to Sweden to figure out how to destroy a planet. </p>

<p>He glanced up at the large map on display, showing the continent of Europe. He mentally ticked off the markets, the <em>countries</em> that were effectively under his control, and was pleased with the result. However, something seemed off, something wasn't right...</p>
<p>"Jessica," he said, "what about Russia?"</p>
<p>Jessica straightened up. "What about 'Russia'?"</p>
<p>Martin pointed up at the map. "We have gained market share control over much of Western and Eastern Europe, but we've hardly made any in-roads into Russia. Why not?"</p>
<p>"It's..." Jessica began. "It's not exactly a prime market right now. The economy is not that great, and our commodities are not highly sought after there. It would not be a sound financial move, at this time."</p>
<p>"But Jessica, look!" Martin waved his hand at the map. "It's just so, so...imbalanced."</p>
<p>"Imbalanced?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I mean, when you look at this map and where we are, we are focusing far to much in the West. We must move East!"</p>
<p>"If it's balance you're after, I can have a different map brought in. One without Russia not on it."</p>
<p>"No, that won't work, I would know it's there. Besides, the trade routes are practically set up already." He got up from his chair and went to the map. "We can get supplies sent to Vilnius, Lithuania, have convoys bypass Minsk and go straight to Viciebsk, Belarus, and hop over the border to Smolensk and then Moscow! We could have our commodities selling there in a week!"</p>
<p>"I'm...not so sure, sir." Jessica worriedly chewed on a pen cap. "Those passes are difficult to navigate, especially being winter right now. And even if we could get there quickly, with such a low demand for our products, we might meet with high resistance."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! I want half of the UK team transferred to this project immediately. I want us selling in Moscow before the end of February. Now go!" He turned towards the window and placed his hand inside his breast coat pocket, feeling the comfort of his large wallet. </p>
<p>Jessica rose cautiously. "Sir, I'm not..."</p>
<p>Martin turned and raised a single eyebrow at Jessica (also a look practiced in the mirror). </p>
<p>Jessica nodded. "Yes sir." She hurriedly left the office.</p>
<p>Martin turned back to the window and caught his dim reflection in the glass, a stately figure with one armed draped across his chest. Yes, this venture into Russia will be exactly was is needed. Nothing could go wrong, now.</p>

<p>I've not been scared for a long time now.</p>
<p>At first the silence was crushing.  It's not loneliness that is the problem, the entire world is now my isolation tank, I can close my eyes and in that quiet my brain conjures entire realities.  Friends, family, smiling and laughing.  In those moments I can even forget that tiny ever present crescent in the sky.</p>
<p>No, loneliness is fine, it's the silence of the living that gets me.  The others don't move anymore, haven't for an eternity.  Their eyes though, if I catch someones face I feel them staring back, baring their soul.  Not going to lie, in the early days I broke down more than once, yelling at those unrelenting faces to say something, anything, just please stop staring.</p>
<p>Can't be yelling at statues if I'm going to save the world though, so now I just carry blindfolds.</p>
<p>The reason I'm not scared?  I figure I can't be alone, even if I can't see them.  Someone...something wrote that message on my arm and in all this time they've looked after me.  On the hardest days when I tried to end it, when I did end it, I would slip into the darkness and the embrace of oblivion, before waking up again unharmed.  Seemed like a curse at first, but like everything in this new reality I adapted, and you haven't lived until you've skydived without a parachute.</p>
<p>Whatever, whoever did this, they have to be interfering. Physics just doesn't make sense anymore.  Take batteries.  The laptop I'm writing this on is my fifth.  I had to upgrade after the previous four were filled with my notes.  Never had to recharge, never went down from 100%.  They get warm though, in the dark their screens glow from photons shooting off.</p>
<p>The sun still warms my skin, I cast shadows on the ground outside, but the sun doesn't change either.  I've looked at it so many times I could draw it's layout of spots in my sleep.  Then again that isn't saying much, after this long I know the back of everyones hands.</p>
<p>The sun warms my skin, and the air is warm, but the sun isn't warming the air,  the lack of wind confirms that paradox.  If I take a magnifying glass to the ground the concentrated light bursts paper into flame.</p>
<p>I spent months doing those tests.  Didn't have any better ideas, certainly had no illusions I could pilot a rocket by myself, so why not document the physics of this reality.  Perhaps by establishing my realities rules I could discern something about those who kept me here.  Eventually I got bored and walked off, leaving my equipment where it lay.  Not like I have to worry about anyone stealing it.</p>
<p>I learned to fly a fighter jet, hope they didn't get too annoyed at the amount of times they had to bring me back during that, but everyone needs a vacation.</p>
<p>When I got back to my experiments I didn't notice it at first.  In this timeless reality there are countless objects caught mid air, what's another one.  It took me a few minutes to realise that the object eight feet off the ground was my notebook.  That couldn't be right, I'd left it propped up on the table.  I spun around, was someone here?  I caught a glimpse of movement and jumped back, heart beating.</p>
<p>Idiot, it was one of my mirrors.</p>
<p>That didn't explain the notebook though.  I paced around the table, looking where the notebook had stood.  Nothing stood out, just the annoying reflection of the sun into my eyes.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Out of my pocket came a packet of tissues.  I tore the corner off one, propped it on the edge of the table and waited.</p>
<p>Waited.</p>
<p>Waited.</p>
<p>I got impatient and went for a walk.</p>
<p>I came back I don't know when.  Longer than the time to eat a meal, less than the time to learn the piano.  I hadn't worn a watch in a while, it's easy to lose track.</p>
<p>Eyes level with the table I stared at the tissue.  There was a good inch between it and the table, ever so gently pushed into the air by the suns reflected light.  Carefully, I picked up the mirror and rotated it, so it faced exactly halfway between the sun and that little crescent in the sky.</p>
<p>It took a while to find all the worlds mirrors.  Longer than the time to learn the piano, less than the time to move a world.  Took even longer to polish more of my own.  </p>
<p>Now I wait, staring at that little disc in the sky.</p>

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 62</p>
<p>It was such a lovely night. I had ventured far out enough that the faint glow of light pollution had only just touched this part of the world. The air was crisp and still, punctuated only by the low creaks and groans of this forgotten part of the forest. It had called to me when i was here 2 years ago and here i was again, marveling at the beauty of this place and its siren effect on me. If you looked just close enough you could still see the faint dig site i had hurriedly made to bury the man i had met off of I-90. He had been a relatively nice man and at the time I'm still not sure what possessed me to take him out here. It was a whim when i drove him to this spot, and it had been a whim when i stuck my knife in his throat. But on this whim i found something that i had never felt before, this palpable feeling of peace that had haunted me for years. It felt so natural that i knew this was my duty in this world. A loud groan from the forest snapped me back into the present and i bent down to pat the site once more for good luck. I stared back into the forest and as if to say something an old pine creaked beside me and i patted it on my way to the car smiling. No need to say goodbye, I'll be right back.</p>
<p>It only took an hour this time. The man had been walking on the shoulder of a stretch of highway not far from my patch of forest. It was a giant relief. Last month it had taken me two weeks to find anyone. If North Dakota hadn't been my last northern state to fulfill my duty in i would have given up completely, but i'm a man of principle and I'm not about to cut corners. I pulled over and politely asked the man if he'd like a ride and he seemed eager to get off the road. He sat down softly next to me and his appearance shocked me. Most of the people i picked up had a weary look that could only be attained by a lifetime of running from themselves. Their eyes were hollow and more often than not they gave off no real sense that they existed. They always seemed to be physical manifestations of ghosts that had just forgotten the part where the bodies were supposed to die. But not this man. He was illuminating. His hair was perfectly sculpted, his clothes were not just cleaned but ironed and pressed to perfection and his voice carried with a confidence that traveled men seldom have. It felt wrong, however the siren call of the forest had been powerful tonight and i could not abandon my duty. In a twist of good faith the man had been needing to travel in the direction of my patch of forest. This was fantastic. It was rather difficult to hold a knife to a mans throat for so many miles and this would save me the annoyance of all the begging and pleading i had grown accustomed to. We maintained a pleasant conversation almost all of the way there. We discussed sports, current events, how the weather this time of year was fantastic. It was truly great small talk. I hadn't been able to enjoy a conversation with someone in so long, that I began to lose that uneasy feeling that had first accompanied the man. The feeling did return however, when i made the turn to head back into the forest. He had not said a word when i made the turn. In fact, it seemed like he was completely comfortable with what i was doing. I began to feel something i hadn't felt in years, a building sense of dread that frankly had no rational base. I clutched the knife under my thigh tight to regain my composure. I was in control here, not him. I stopped the in front of the tree and before i could say a word i felt a sharp burning in my chest. Before i looked down i already knew what had occurred. It had felt to wrong and yet at the same time all to similar. The conversation, the appearance of the man. I looked down at the knife in my chest and breathed a rattling sigh. The man looked at me with a knowing expression, and I smiled back at him. It was okay i was at peace, he was after all, just doing his duty.</p>
<p>The man buried the body next to the shoddy grave site. He wiped his hands on the grass and stood up taking one last look into the forest. A cold wind blew through and the forest was alive with its beautiful call. The man walked back to the car smiling, stopping only to pat the old pine on his way.</p>

<h4>[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.</h4>
<p>Score: 56</p>
<p>"Ok, so you're certain it's the <strong>SEVENTH</strong> son. Not, you know, the seventieth or something?" Michael asked Vikus slightly desperately. </p>
<p>The local fortune-teller had shot to worldwide fame when his predictions were proven to be 100% accurate. The little boy who had grown up in Michael's town had become a superstar. Knowing him had its perks - he easily locked down his first appointment with the man.</p>
<p>But Vikus didn't exactly spare him on the details. In fact, he seemed positively gleeful sharing terrible facts. But he could have made a mistake this time - Michael had spent years donating his swimmers, after all. Maybe it wasn't the seventh son, after all.</p>
<p>"Indeed. Your murder approaches in three minutes, actually," he added helpfully, peering at the tarot cards. "Mmm...let's see. The only way you'll avoid it is if you...mmm. This is difficult to read."</p>
<p>"Well, it seems a pretty fucking important detail. Could you hurry it up?" Michael snapped, glancing behind him to see if he could spot someone sneaking up on him. He thought the worn little building in the corn field had been chosen for its ominous atmosphere. A marketing gimmick. It seemed less comical and more sinister, now.</p>
<p>"Wait a few minutes, maybe it'll become clear," Vikus said finally, caught up in a trance as he stared at the cards.</p>
<p>Michael glared at him suspiciously. Vikus had his eyes closed and didn't notice. </p>
<p>"And how do I know you're not my supposed murderer?" he asked, looking at the fortune-teller closely. </p>
<p>Dark hair, slightly large nose, square jaw: their features were eerily similar. Somehow, he'd never noticed that before.</p>
<p>Vikus looked up and stared at Michael. The fortune teller's eyes were his most famous feature: piercing green. They seemed to be glowing. Michael stared at him, fascinated. It was difficult not to. If he stared at you for more than ten seconds, it was rumoured he'd reveal a life-changing fact. </p>
<p>"You shouldn't have drunk the tea," Vikus said finally, glancing down and shuffling his cards. </p>
<p>Michael dropped to the floor, foam forming at the edges of his mouth. Vikus chuckled slightly to himself, locking the door. After making sure his father was truly dead, he dialled a number on his phone.</p>
<p>"I got him," he said. "Tell the others, will you?"</p>
<p>He dragged the body to the corner of the room and covered it up, then carefully placed six chairs around the table. It had taken a few years, but he'd got the central ingredient for the spell. It helped that he'd grown up in the same town as his father. That had been a stroke of luck his siblings could only dream of. </p>
<p>They arrived slowly, robed in black from head to toe. Vikus resisted rolling his eyes. Dark wizards did have such a taste for the dramatic. What was next, matching tattoos of skulls?</p>
<p>"Welcome, my brothers," he began slowly. </p>
<p>"We have much to thank our father for. Though he never used his latent power, it was passed down to all of us. Secondly, he's kindly going to feature in our special spell tonight. Remember, some of our brothers may still be out there. We won't know until we pool our powers, and read one another's visions. This spell has never been performed before, and there are dangers. I won't deny that. But just think - pooled, our powers will be more potent. More powerful, and infinitely more dangerous. Are you ready?"</p>
<p>"<em>Hell</em> yeah," Seth, their youngest brother, burst out. "Just think what we'll be able to do. Let's rock this bitch!"</p>
<p>"Okay, settle down, Seth," Vikus snapped. "Let's just start this. It's supposed to take a few hours."</p>
<p>They joined hands, and started muttering the words. In the linked circle, one of the brothers' eyes snapped open. None of them knew of his prophecy, of course. That one brother would betray the others. That only one would have the power to stop the spell. </p>
<p>He examined his feelings of disgust for what they were doing, his revulsion for his brothers. It had taken all his tenacity, all his cunning to fool them about his loyalties. He had an idea who the traitor should be. But he had no idea how he was supposed to do it.</p>
<p>He stared at his father's corpse, paralysed with fear as his brothers' chanting grew with intensity. How was <em>he</em> supposed to stop six dark wizards? Was he supposed to let the spell be completed, so they had access to one another's visions? Maybe one of his brothers had an answer to his question. Trouble was, then they'd know about him.</p>
<p>The sweat ran down his back, as he listened to the chanting, and shivered with indecision. Not a familiar feeling for him. </p>

<p>Score: 51</p>
<p>The temporal particles faded from sight with a roar of burning spacetime. The silence left behind seeming to sing with a high pure note, tinged with the birdsong of 1940. There in front of me, about 50 yards down the hill was my target. Hitler. The Fuhrer. Head of the nazi party and leader of the German government. He lay in the sunshine, face down on a carved stone bed, modesty only protected by the small white towel wrapped around his hips. The spa was empty, the only way in from below and the guards standing too far away to hear. A soft hum announced the small lift's arrival, the Fuhrer not looking up as the masseuse crossed around behind him started to run his back. The masseuse was a tall Germanic man, his blond hair similar to mine, his features rougher and less attractive though. He finished rubbing the Fuhrer's body and turned to wash the scented oil off of his hands. I hastened my journey down the cliff face, quickly arriving behind the masseuse and plunging the needle into his neck. Quickly stowing his body under the small rock shelf I turned and continued to massage the evil man in front of me, waiting for the right time to strike.</p>
<p>He turned his head, looking me in the eye. I froze, expecting a shout, shots ringing out, pain, but none of this came. The Fuhrer turned face up on the bed, guiding my hand to his erect penis. I was conflicted, I wanted to kill him in the manner that I had set out, but I did not want to draw this out any longer than I had to. I started to reciprocate, watching the pleasure grow on his face. This was not what I wanted at all. I tried to keep the look of disgust off of my face as I brought him off quickly. I plunged the syringe deep into his face, freezing it in place and quickly turning his skin to stone. My plan was to bump into him and turn him into a statue as he turned and tried to shout with his face full of angry fury. This was obviously not what I had achieved. The burning smell of reality particles filled my nasal passages and I was sucked back into my own time. Three years it had taken me to get my name on the list. Three years. I had failed. The prize money would never be mine. The cheer when I got back was deafening. I stood gawping, confused. There was no way for them to have seen what happened no? Only the images of the aftermath.</p>
<p>I looked up at the picture stretched across the wall and immediately new that I had won. I had done it. The year's greatest killing of hitler. The headlines would write themselves: "cum face disgrace at final resting place".</p>

<h4>[WP] A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rouge planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".</h4>
<p>Score: 40</p>
<p>When you have to get rid of a planet, you need to break a few eggs.<br />
As far as I could tell about the rule, its not allowed for a single human being to die; seems I need to save all 7 billion from this fucking rock catapulting at us. I figured that out during the first couple days of the timefreeze, when I was doing whatever the hell I wanted. I- well, tried to- killed an old client that had been making life hell for me in the past. Picked him up, threw him off the building. Right when he woke up whole world went black. I woke up in the field I started in later, I have no idea how "long" it was.<br />
The first problem is that if that godforsaken rock grazes us it kills billions; its about the same size of Earth as far as I could tell. The other problem is that I'm  not some astronaut who could do anything closely related to space to stop this hunk of planet; I'm just a chicken farmer in Asia.<br />
I spent what probably was years thinking through every single problem. No time was passing, so I never got tired, never had to sleep, or eat, just was able to think or move. </p>
<p>"Could I destroy this rogue planet?" I had all the time in the world, so if I could get my hands on some bombs then I could try. I rode a bike through China trying to find anything at all that I could use. Fun fact, the "no humans dying" rule included myself, so I could go however fast I wanted; if I crashed then I would just wake up in that field, next to the frozen chickens. After what was probably months I found the Chinese armory; a couple weeks later and I was into one of the biggest military foundations on Earth. I found some metric tons of C4 and knew that if I needed more, I had the entire worlds force at my fingertips. I could even get a nuke; it took me a decade but I finally got into the base.  </p>
<p>What was likely a century later, my plan was ruined. You see, something about this time situation I was in was that it was contained to this earth. I found out the hard way that if I left the atmosphere of Earth I would just awaken immediately at the field. They may had put that in place so that I couldn't escape Earth and try to just save myself, or some other reason; I had no clue. I had a worlds worth of demolitions to destroy this planet, but I couldn't reach it. This put me in a depression that lasted several lifetimes, until I got an idea.  </p>
<p>"If I can't destroy this planet, I can ruin ours."<br />
The "no lives affected" rule applies to humans alone, not to animals, and not to the earth as I saw. So after wallowing in a literal pool of tears (I never ran out of the liquid), I had an idea: The scientists on the television had said that the planet was hitting us straight on. However, I had read their notes a few years back, and read that it was actually hitting us at a slant. The entire South Equator was gone, but about where Greenland was, individuals could actually survive the blast. There was a bunker built miles and miles underground and a shelter that could host millions. The problem was that I needed 7 billion individuals safe.  So I had a two step plan.  </p>
<p>Step one: Get everyone over there. This was the hardest part of the plan. It also took what I bet was a literal eon of time to do, but I managed to pick up every single individual on this planet Earth and move them to Greenland. Searching through jungles, over deserts, in cities, evacuating them all slowly but surely to Greenland. Lifting them over my head and putting them all on a cargo plane (I learned the hard way how to fly a plane) and then bringing them all to Greenland. After that was complete I moved on to step two: getting them inside. I got the first 8 million inside just fine but then we started running out of room. A couple million more and the place was full to bursting; not a single soul could fit into this cavern.  So I did what any man with all the time in the world would do.<br />
I picked up a shovel and started digging.  </p>
<p>That's where I am now. I've been digging this hole for ages. Had the bright idea of keeping a journal of everything I've done so I wouldn't go insane, and am taking a break to fill you in. I've seen more rock than every mortal man on earth has combined. And I'll continue to do so for an eternity more, and then once the hole is big enough I'll have to make walls, make rooms, bring in livestock, allow everyone in here to actually survive. But I'm ready for that challenge. After all, I have all the time in the world.</p>

<p>The Time-Traveling Assassins League, or T-TAL as it was known, was established soon after it was discovered that time travel didn't effect our timeline. It's goal was to kill the most notorious criminals throughout the history in the most creative, complex, and often gruesome ways and had only two rules:</p>

2. No sabotaging your opponent.
3.a. Regular Season Kill Time Limit is 3 months

<p>In the professional league you could work alone or as a team, though working alone was almost unheard of now a days . The two teams would go head to head (though in separate timelines) and were judged by a combination of the popular vote and the scoring of overall creativity, historical impact, and complexity by professional judges. The loser was out for the season. Each team was . At the beginning of the killing season (as it was called), the teams could kill anyone they wanted. But near the end of the season, when most of the other teams were out, the kill list was narrowed to any notorious criminal in a specified time period (i.e WWII). The Final Kill was determined by owner of T-TAL.</p>
<p>The league began with a group of rich kids who had too much time on their hands and their parents time machines. On the weekends they began competing to see who could kill the bully of the week or that asshole teacher. As time went on the game grew and eventually had a cult following and the assassin’s league started. During the early years the murder and suicide rate exploded, the government tried to intervene but there wasn't much they could do. But after an official league with rules and regulations was created, and the murders became televised and more focused on notorious killers and the atrocities they committed, a strange thing happened. All violent crimes virtually stopped. Humanity didn't like to see its ugly face in the mirror, nor did anyone want to end up being a famous target. The sad part is, only one of the original T-TAL members was alive to see the peace they created. All the others killed themselves.</p>
<p>Fifteen years. Fifteen years was all it took for T-TAL to become the powerhouse corporation it is today. It's owner was the last founding member and, coincidentally, your narrator. At 29, I was the youngest billionaire and most influential man in the world. I write the rules, I decide who the Final Kill would be, and as long as a season was going, I had the full attention of the world. This, of course, excluded those in the Final Kill who decided to play the long con. There is still a guy who has been in the Roman Empire for 5 years, waiting to kill Emperor Nero (less fun than I originally expected). He surprisingly has a pretty strong cult following. As I’ve become accustomed to this power and authority, and since I have weld it so responsibly, I believe it is my duty to ensure I stay at the top. But the past few years a team known as the Berlin Strikers has been trying to undermine me and overtake the league. Trying to unionize all assassins, trying to turn the people against me, trying to buy out the shareholders, but they forget exactly who I am. And this year I intend to remind them.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this season I disguised myself and secretly enrolled with the pro’s and worked my way up to the Final Kill, as had the Berlin Strikers. I had placed a proxy in my stead, allowing him to pick the FK this year, but on one stipulation, he had to pick two. Two notorious killers within the same era. As promised he picked two, though unoriginal, very interesting picks. Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin. What made this so interesting was that depending on your timing of the first kill, the timeline for the second kill will be completely changed. Any historical knowledge you have will be rendered useless for the second kill.</p>
<p>The time had come, I stepped up to my platform, dressed in my USSR Officer uniform. I had decided to begin with Stalin first, right at the start of the Great Purges in 1934. Based on the Striker’s peasant clothing, they decided on some sort of Soviet uprising. Amateurs. I stepped through my timeline and felt the nostalgic pull and twist pf time travel. A feeling I had not felt since me and the remaining founders swore it off after the second suicide. I smiled as I landed in a brisk Russian winter and I turned on my universal translator. This wasn’t going to take long. My plan was simple, I was going to prey on Stalin’s paranoia until it killed him. As for Hitler, that’s a surprise. </p>
<p>I took out my list of those killed in the purges and began. I instilled my face with everyone on that list, making sure Stalin associated me with every person he saw as a threat to his regime. Each time I reappeared down the timeline I saw his face become more angered, and something else. What is that? No matter, I continued with the plan. Only four stops lefts. The first was early July 1939, I went up Stalin’s foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov and whispered into his ear while Stalin watched. Vyacheslav Molotov was supposed to negotiate a peace agreement with Germany but as I ran out and punched in my next location, I heard a gunshot and knew that wasn’t going to happen. My next jump was a week later in Hitler’s office where I placed a letter from “Stalin” insisting the agreement should be made between the two of them and their top advisors and then did the same with Stalin. With the meeting’s time and date set, I had my final destination.</p>
<p>At the meeting between the two groups, the Soviets and the Nazis, I changed into my second set of clothes; a Nazi officer uniform. I made myself seen to Stalin right before the agreement was signed. He stopped dead, he looked at me, mouth gaping. Slowly, he stood and pointed, saying, “Y-you…I know you. You have been plotting against me for years.” He turned to Hitler, who looked as shocked as any, and said, “YOU have been plotting against me, weakening the Soviet State. You have brought me such despair and heartache. Many good comrades died because of your deception. And you expect me to have peace with your empire?! No.” And with that Stalin took his pistol and killed Hitler. At this the room burst out in gun fire, Stalin being the first to die. At that I was automatically teleported back to the present. I was created by a thundering applause within the stadium. A near perfect score across the board, and the Strikers had barely began their uprising. But something of what Stalin said had stuck with me and I finally realized the look on his face. It was despair…he realized there was no hope for him and his reign. That someone would always be trying to overthrow him, to take control. A sudden rush of realization came over me. I was just like Stalin and Hitler and all other tyrannical leaders, and it was only a matter of time before I began my massacres. With this I threw off my disguise, ignoring the gasps of the crowd, took out my revolver, and shot myself. And for the first time for a long time, I was at peace.</p>

Hitler and all the top-ranking nazi officials will be watching germany's proudest soldier star in the fatherland's greatest propaganda. </p>
<p>Aldo waits in the lobby eyeing out recognizable war criminals. spitting his best Italian speak he can muster. "Errrr... quattro punti." he whispers under his breathe with peeled eyes. </p>
<p>The two disguised Allied soldiers drop their hidden bars of bright pink soap and head for the projector room while the movie starts. A blast is heard by none as they execute one of the last steps of the plan and invade the projection room to set up with the other conspirators. </p>
<p>Below in the lobby, Hans Landa (dubbed The Jew Hunter) has uncovered the Allies plot and kidnaps Lt. Aldo. "I heard you counting, Luitenant." Hans exclaims in an overly loud and serious tone. "You think you're going to impress the judges? Call them, see what they'll say." Hans slides an old rotary phone and waits for the american's reply. </p>
<p>Lt. Aldo sits there for a moment with hands tide behind his back, and eyes the two guards behind. He stares back at the German before him, and spits the most american lugi, soaking the phone as he laughs in his face. "Fuck the Judges, the Hitler game's are corrupt!

<p>"Bingo!" the german shouts, giddy with his winning shady business, having just betrayed his plans.</p>
<p>"Just one more thing you Nazi fuck." Aldo whispers. A chilling mood takes the room. Hans is spooked and confused. Aldo takes a sip of his starbucks coffee, and Hans knows someone's about to die because he reads clickbait titles about David Fincher. "You broke the first rule of Time Travelin' Killin' Hitler Club." The whole theatre explodes into an all consuming fire.

<p>As he roamed from house to house he saw the same scene. No sound. No birds. No bugs. Only perfectly still neighbors. Hour after hour it was still about noon. A horrific realization began washing over him during the next few days as the sun sat motionless in the sky and nothing else, anywhere, moved. Ian gazed up at the approaching body and scoffed at the unimaginable task which seeped into his thoughts. A madness seeded his consciousness. </p>

<p>Score: 21</p>
<p>Everyone wants to kill Hitler but they can't quite do it right. The first time traveler decided to kill Hitler, right as the war was ending, via cyanide. Okay, sure, the suicide staging was pretty sweet, but the poor guys who had to live and die through it all probably wouldn't have appreciated it.</p>
<p>So later on, a few years later in my time, a time traveler decided to kill him as he was watching a play. It turns out he managed to kill some other guy instead. How he managed that, I'll never know, but ever since then, we've all been a little leery of time travel assassinations. The technology isn't cheap, as it costs us a good few quintillion dollars each time. Then again, with inflation these days, that isn't much.</p>
<p>In the bars, when the night's almost over, we all like to talk about ways to kill Hitler again, the proper way. One guy suggested we put him in his own gas chambers for the irony, another suggested we take out little Hitler before he showed his true evil. Somebody suggested that we kill his father, Alois Hitler, and another took it one step further and kill his grandfather, Johann Georg Hiedler.</p>
<p>I liked this idea, but maybe a little too much. It didn't occur to me at the time, but his ancestors are innocents in this war, just as much as the ones who died at the hands of the monster himself. But hey, when you're rich and you've got all the robots you need, what's left to do other than play god? So I went back in time, to the year 1800, to kill Grandfather Hitler.</p>
<p>What you should know is that, when we go back in time, we can bring certain objects with us, as long as they're relatively uncomplex. We can bring guns, but they have to be completely dismantled. We could bring gunpowder, but we couldn't bring modern bullets. I really don't know who makes up these rules; sadly, the technology is too new for scientists to have time to study it properly yet. Unlike those kooky movies from the 90's and 2000's, we could bring our own clothes, but the buttons and velcro wouldn't stay with us, even if it already existed in the area that we were time traveling to.</p>
<p>So I brought the simplest clothes I could find - my <a href="https://www.lastexittonowhere.com/media/cache/96/ca/96cabcf0b211fe185b49fd1bf8379d74.jpg">Jaws 19 promo t-shirt</a>, and the plainest pants I had. Keep in mind that in my time, logos have completely taken over all of our clothing and objects. We stopped making plain shirts in the 2000's, and the big companies managed to finally pass a law preventing us little people from making our own clothes - or anything else, for that matter.</p>
<p>With my disassembled gun and a map of Austria, I set out to find my target. Immediately, I ran into a few hitches in my master plan of blindly time traveling here with a gun. I don't know the language, I don't know where my target is, and I've never made a bullet in my life. All things that I probably could have learned in the time of The YouTube and The Google, but in my time, hackers had long since taken over the Internet and called it their own. So shortly after assembling the gun, I went to a time traveling station, one of the many locations made around the world for time travelers (and only time travelers) to return to their own time. My mission was a failure before I had even started, but it wasn't like it was that big of a deal.  I figured I would go back later when I was more equipped for the mission, like another trip to the grocery store.</p>
<p>Now the problem is, I forgot to disassemble the gun. It didn't disappear, but rather stayed in the time period that I left, a diner that was to be the reverse time travel location in Austria.  So when I traveled back, imagine my surprise when I found that the whole world was already owned by Hitler. His symbols, his face, and his evil permeated my once-peaceful world.  Apparently, his grandchildren had taken over where he left off, after they took control with the use of a futuristic gun that was recreated in mass quantities after I left. Nobody knew how the weapons were obtained, but I knew. In shame, I used my last time travel, a portable disassembled in my bag. But in my hurry to get out of the time period that I had inadvertently built, I came to the year 2000 instead of 1800. Now, 16 years after the last known time travel in history and time, I still tell my story to those who will keep fighting, hoping that the future that I destroyed can one day be repaired again.</p>

<p>"Mr. President?"</p>
<p>The room was silent afterwards. And I could not blame them for the looks they where all shooting at me. When you become the most successful POTUS by reducing the National Debt to nothing, striking peace deals between long warring Middle Eastern factions, and setting the country up to become the world's first Carbon Neutral government; why in the hell would you invade Russia?</p>
<p>"I know that most of you think that an attack on Russia is out of the question, but you must know that I would not suggest such action unless it was absolutely necessary. Not a single one of our former enemies stand against us except for one nation. ISIS has been erased thanks to the help of our European and Asian allies, Korea is a fully unified front thanks to the efforts of our military, and even the nations that once harbored strong feelings of anti-American sentiment dwindle on a day to day basis due to our actions of reasoning and understanding. The only place to dare challenge the authority of the New Free Order is Russia. Talk has dried up, any efforts of our allies to aide them is met with armed resistance, and frankly I find it all a bit much when they refuse to acknowledge our peace to be one of mutual benefit and us relenting to their demands. If history had taught us anything, they are the one nation to stand between total Utopia and a continuation of status-quo bickering of olden days. It is my opinion that our efforts focus on stamping out the last of our hold outs in order to begin anew."</p>
<p>"But Mr. President. How could you, of all people, forget that not one single person in history has been able to take Russia?"</p>
<p>"Do not worry about that. One thing about mistakes is that you can learn from them. I plan on doing just that. How is our climate change satellite coming along?"</p>
<p>"It should be ready in two weeks. We will be able to inhabit Antarctica in no time."</p>
<p>"Good. Then we begin by testing it out in Siberia and begin our campaign."  </p>

<p>The rise to power had not been easy.</p>
<p>It began with unrest. The people of my country grew tired of corruption, of ignorance and greed. I offered an alternative. It was never my intention to become a demagogue. Seemingly overnight, people rallied to my words, carried my spite filled messages regarding the foreigners who would poison our homeland as if it were scripture. Soon enough, I didn't even have to win a democratic election. It was given to me.</p>
<p>That was in the 2050's. Through years of savvy maneuvering, political alliances, and shady deals, I managed to put my country in good standing with the many skeptic world leaders. This was hard to do, to convince to the world that a country with such a rich history as mine could turn to someone who is seemingly a dictator, and flourish under them. The accusations of human rights violations would be swept under the rug, along with the weapons manufacturing and uranium enrichment facilities. Things were coming along nicely. </p>
<p>It deviated in 2070. That year, for some reason, sparked a desire within me. My goal raged at my corporeal form, begging to be realized. I knew what had to be done. I set my sight for Russia. There was no true reason why, it made almost no sense to an outsider. Even to the large portion of my own country, my invasion seemed nonsensical. This was only exacerbated by the fact that my Chilean army was insignificantly ill prepared to invade the barren land in the dead of winter. Our forces were quickly crushed, and our bombs shot from the sky. </p>
<p>The entire world wasn't as much shocked as it was... confused. It really didn't add up. I suppose some things never will. My transgressions did, however, spark a great war between Chile and Russia, a terrible conflict that would claim thousands of lives in the counter invasion of our country. Once again, terribly thought out planning on my part, for which I take full responsibility. In fact, I'm obliged to take full responsibility as I write now, filling out this quick autobiography before I am marched from my cell to the U.N. Courts along with my military advisers for my unwarranted attack on a peaceful sovereign nation. </p>
<p>As I prepare to stand for my crimes, I must wonder, what truly is the allure to attempt Russia in the dead of winter?</p>

<h4>[WP] A serial killer who kills hitchhikers picks up a serial killer who kills the people who pick him up.</h4>
<p>Score: 15</p>
<p>My hands were getting sweaty as they do right before I do it. I had picked up this loner about thirty miles ago. These roads are desolate, no one is driving through here. I know I'm gonna kill this sad fuck just like the rest of them. I imagine the point of my knife just jumping in and out of his stomach. My pulse started to pick up. My vision was getting blurry, and I start seein' red. I love the feeling of bloodlust. I live for it. It's why I do this over and over again. Once was just not enough, there is no number of dead hitchhikers that can sate me. <br />
I pulled the car into a deserted park and ride on the right side of the road. My unfortunate co-pilot turns to me and says "Something's wrong? I know Ashford is just a bit up the road..." He seems nervous. Good. I like to see the fear written on their face. "Nah, buddy, everything's good. I just been driving for a bit 'n gotta stretch a little bit."<br />
He moves to undo his seatbelt, thinkin' he's gonna get out and walk around or something. Hah, fat chance says I. In a flash, I pull my knife and stab down into his belly. Pure extacy possesses my facial expression as I anticipate the telltale signs of his stomach bleeding out. That's when I hear it, that unfamiliar sound. A soft 'ting'.<br />
As I look down, I see he's blocked my knife with his own. "Think you're gonna pull a fast one on me eh? Got news for you pal, only one of us is leaving with our lives, and it's not gonna be you" my passenger remarks. With a flourish, he pushes back my knife and leaps out of the car. I can't let this guy go; none of the others ever escaped and I'm not about to let that change. We both bolt out of our doors. I slide across the hood with a rear arching swing, trying to stab him in the soft spot where the neck meets the collar bone.<br />
This guy's good, though. He anticipates my swing and leans back at the last second. My knife catches some fibers and tears his shirt. I hop back a step, knife brandished in front of my chest, edge pointed towards my prey, other hand up ready to guard. We both charge and swing down. I catch his knife arm by the wrist as it's coming towards me, and he does the same. I'm inches away from this guy, grappled. I can smell his rank sweat pouring off his forehead. We lock eyes, and for the first time I see the look on his face. It's the same one I get before I make a kill. My mind is racing, who is this guy? Where did he even come from? Why is he resisting so much? He catches a hint of my uneasiness from my eyes.<br />
"I'm gonna take a stab at this and suggest this isn't the first time you've killed a passenger. Well, got news for you, pal...this isn't the first time I've killed someone dumb enough to pick me up." We start struggling, trying to twist out of each other's grasp. I catch him off guard with a knee to the ribs, and send him to his knees. First thing I did after that was kicked his knife from his hand before I fell on top of him, poised to strike. Thinking I've got the advantage, I raise my knife in both hands ready to plunge it into his stinkin' heart. I roar and slam down on his chest. My blade connects, and I start to feel the warm sticky blood flow over my hands. I look down to see what I've done. Expecting to see his face writ with horror, all that remains is a shit eating grin. That's when I feel it, a sharp pain in my ribs. I look and see he's stuck me good. Another knife? I've messed up. Breathing's become harder. I feel the fluid building up in my chest. Dammit. Dammit dammit dammit! I've done this so many times before...why now? There were so many left to kill. I feel weak, vision's blurry, can't stay sittin' up anymore. Feelin' tired. Feelin' lighter. World's all horizontal now, breathin' in dirt. He ain't movin' either though.  </p>

<p>Score: 10</p>
<p>The first year was the hardest to endure.  When everything froze I had a panic attack that reduced me to convulsions on a closet floor.  I gathered blankets, pillows, and heavy objects like books, weights, and my stereo, with what little mental clarity I had.  After covering myself with everything, I waited for it to stop.  In hindsight it is kind of funny that I thought of the stop of time as a going-on, but this is an unnecessary point.  </p>
<p>I waited it out for what I thought must have been a couple of days.  This was when I was confronted with the problem of keeping time in a timeless world.  It was such a foreign concept, especially the sun remaining fixed in the sky, that I had to retreat to the closet and wait out the shocks every so often.  Eventually, my body fell into a rhythm and the cycles sleeping and waking were marked as days.  </p>
<p>It was after about 20 of these days that I noticed marks on my right forearm.  Whether they showed up all of a sudden or I was blind to them from my hysteria, it does not matter.  What does matter is that they spelled out “however long it takes save us.”  This naturally sent me back to my trusted closet for a few days.  </p>
<p>It took me 13 years to figure out what needed saving.  Apparently a rogue planet was about to hit the Earth and end all life here.  The government wasn’t going to tell anyone to avoid a panic.  If they were the ones who did this, which I haven’t found anything yet that points to that conclusion, they could’ve at least left some breadcrumbs behind to help. </p>
<p>Anyways, this is the very abridged beginning of the written account of my activity.  I figured writing would be a great birthday gift to myself.  Hopefully this year, lucky 136, will bring me closer to an answer.</p>

<p>Marlin and Nemo had never been closer since their daring adventure in the South Pacific. It had been nearly a year since their reunion and Dory had been long since forgotten. Today they had a lovely day planned to unwind and simply enjoy one another's company; something they both had learned to treasure more each day. </p>
<p>As they were swimming along the coral, Nemo innocently asked his father to recount some of the more obscure memories of his childhood. </p>
<p>"well son, I'd have to say the strangest thing that ever happened to me was a few years ago before I found your mother. I was a wild young fish in those days... I was obsessed with the ladies and eventually crossed this one particularly attractive fish who cursed me when she found I had been cheating on her, 'on the seventh day of the seventh month of the seventh year of your life, your seventh son will murder you'... Pretty crazy right?" </p>
<p>" wow... Yeah that is crazy Dad. Wait a minute, isn't your eighth birthday coming up soon?" Nemo responded. </p>
<p>"I suppose it is... Ah, I wouldn't worry about it too much. You're the only son I've ever known. Besides, everyone knows curses aren't real."</p>
<p>The pair swam along for a while longer before heading to Bruce's new lair for some fun. Bruce was in an unusually poor mood that night. He insisted he could smell an entire school of fish lurking just out of sight, and was incredibly distraught as he fought his natural instinct to eat father and son.</p>
<p>Not wanting to burden their friend, Marlin and Nemo wished him a good night and went on their way. Nemo insisted, however, that they search for the phantom fish Bruce smelled and warn them of the danger they faced being in such close proximity to a starving shark. </p>
<p>It didn't take them long to find an entire school of clown fish hiding in a small cave less than a league away from the cavernous jaws of Bruce. Before they could utter a single word, however, the entire school rushed to surround them. In a flash, Marlin found himself under attack by fin after fin. Nemo was quickly knocked unconscious to the sea floor while Marlin fought for his life biting and slapping furiously in all directions. </p>
<p>Suddenly a roar erupted from behind them, "Herrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre's Brucey!!!". Bruce's thunderous entrance caught the school off balance but the damage had been done. Marlin was bleeding from at least three different places and he could see the pitch black blood lust in his friend's eyes.</p>
<p>Yet through the haze of death swarming around him, Marlin made out a cold, calm voice call out to him. "Marlin... Today is the seventh day of the seventh month of the seventh year of your life. And I, Jeffrey, am your seventh son. Today you pay the price for the pain you wrought on my mother." </p>
<p>When Nemo awoke, all that was left of the frenzy was a cloud of blood and the sound of Bruce sobbing in the distance, "fish are friends... Not food".</p>
<p>..."daddy? Where are you...?"</p>

Then, as a child, in my coronation I was given supreme control of the army (simply a ceremonial title you understand). The trickle became a flood when I declared martial law last year, but I am strong enough to weather it: the world is too busy scrambling to bleed as enough oil from their lands to keep from drowning in darkness. No one cares about my rocky islands at the end of the earth.</p>
<p>But each of these rocks I and my subjects stand on is sacred, and the world will soon remember their place: mere satellites. My priests say so, and the people cling to it, to me, as their saviour, to reclaim their rightful place as the master race with me as their god. I am the messiah to them, the Maitreya: and like a Buddha or a Byzantine Emperor, I am beyond them. I am but glimpsed behind a screen, or through smoke, and yet still my power is felt. A sighting of me, however fleeting or obscure, is the peak of a mortal mans existence, the closest they can come to divinity in the physical world. </p>
<p>It is a highly effective way to rule.</p>
<p>Academics will tell you that the world has moved beyond the era of religious propaganda, that it is no longer the opiate of the masses. Or at least they did: conformity, in my experience, is a wonderful side effect of penal battalions. </p>
<p>The Americans humiliated my land, but I learn from my forefathers mistakes: they are not a priority. But right on our doorstep lies endless land, endless resources, endless glory that I will give to my loyal followers. Whatsmore, there is nothing to stop me: for the endless land is wide open, its guardians are relics of a long dead superpower, bogged down in provincial warfare and heightened border tensions in the West, thanks in part to my agents (my will does not observe international borders). Perhaps we can repay their backstab in the final hours of the last war, and establish a position on the world stage where the Americans can yet see my will.</p>
<p>As I write this, The Diamond of the Russian East, Vladivostock, is being rapidly reduced to it's base carbon; it is the funeral pyre of the New Russian Empire, smothered in its cradle even as Tsar Sobyanin celebrates his victory over the pretender Shoigu with a military parade in Red Square, complete with the execution of the rebel Kadyrov. I am reminded of the carp, meandering in this very pond in this very garden in which I write, among the reeds and the lemongrass and the bamboo, even as the heron gazes on them from the world they do not see.</p>
<p>Reader, you can never know the awesome feeling of looking down at your emulators, and simply laughing as you might at a child wearing their fathers clothes, even as you move to smite them. Such is my view of the Russians, the fabled "Red Menace".</p>
<p>My attack Helicopters ignore General Winter, soaring through crisp arctic air over crisp arctic tundra, emblazoned with everything from Shinto blessings to anime characters (most of the ground crews are drafted highschool students, eager to serve after I set them loose of their teachers during my ascent to the celestial throne). My chosen have reached the river Yenisei, with the equally fervent regular troops in close pursuit: from our forward base at Krasnoyarsk, only ancient Novosibirsk, renamed for the even now semi-mythic founder of the New Russian Empire, Putin, as Putingrad, remains in our way. It has been fortified, but our technological might and my divine will knows no barrier: the 6th Army can surely take it, and by the time the cherry blossoms here, in my palace garden, fall, my disciples will have crossed the Urals and my air force will convey me to Moscow: they will have the privilege to feel my will in person.</p>
<p>None shall stand in my way. I am the wrath of the Gods, come to cleanse the world of the impure and the shameful. I am both the Emperor and the Shogun. The Maitreya and the Warrior. The fated sword cut and the hidden dagger. My sun shall rise, ever from the east, and the men of the west shall know my will: they will kneel or they will be consumed by my fire. Banzai!</p>

<p>Score: 9</p>
<p>'Oh hey.' The young man peering into the car had three day stubble and a smile that didn't quite match the rest of his opening, welcome face. It was too big. Much, much too big. </p>
<p>'Hey.' The driver said. He was driving an old Chevy Impala Convertible 71'. In Fireapple Red. Good nick too. All polished up and chromed. The man behind the wheel was a well groomed man of about thirty five. Suit immaculately pressed. Cufflinks arranged so they were at the optimal angle to reflect what little light there was. The driver cleared his throat. 'You... uh... still want a lift?' </p>
<p>'Yes. That would be good.' The young man adjusted his backpack with a faint clinking of metal. </p>
<p>'Okay then.' The driver smiled and popped open the door locks. The young man slung the backpack off his shoulder and dropped into the car. </p>
<p>They drove in silence. The driver didn't ask for a destination and the young man didn't provide one. The radio played quietly. The driver scratched his forehead. He looked sideways at the young man. The young man looked back at him, clutching the backpack he had on his knees. The driver sighed. </p>
<p>'Well, fuck.' He said.</p>
<p>'Yeah I know. This is awkward isn't it?' The young man said, his shoulders relaxing. </p>
<p>'Tell me about it. Never happened to me before.' He gripped the wheel, concentrating on the road lit by the harsh yellow of the headlamps. </p>
<p>'Oh it's happened to me before.' The young man smiled. </p>
<p>'God, really? That must be embarrassing.' </p>
<p>'Yeah, I was up in Yorkshire, you know the guy up there everyone's talking about? Turned out to be this little old lady. We had a good laugh about it.' The young driver put his backpack on the floor and slouched into his seat. 'This is a cool ride by the way. Ideal.' </p>
<p>'Aw thanks man. Had it imported from America. Bugger to ship here.' The driver offered him a sweet from the bag he kept in the glovebox. The young man declined. 'How's it going for you man?' </p>
<p>'Slow.' The young man looked downcast and picked at his nails. </p>
<p>'Tell me about it.' The driver said. </p>
<p>'Drivers getting itchy about passengers now. Won't take hitchhikers because they're getting scared.' The young man picked up his backpack and shook it. 'Even less likely if you're carrying something. That just makes you seem even more suspicious.'</p>
<p>'I'm having a worse time of it. People just won't believe in altruism any more. And the news media is killing hitchhiking. All these bastards who just ruin it for the rest of us.' </p>
<p>They sat in comfortable silence. The young man smoked a cigarette and the driver  didn't mind at all. He always thought it added atmosphere to their kind of journeys. The young man dropped his cigarette out the window where it became a glowing jewel on the rode in the the rear view mirror. The young man craned his neck and could make out a sign ahead. It was a turnpike. Ideal for hitchhiking. He pointed it out to the driver.</p>
<p>'Just let me out here mate, that's brilliant.' The driver pointed the car at the hard shoulder and braked hard. They skidded to a stop. The young man stuck out his hand. </p>
<p>'Nice to meet a like minded traveller.' He said. The driver shook his hand. The young man pulled himself out the car and leant back to get his backpack. There was two loud pops. The driver clutched at his belly. It came away slick and red. Something glistened under the the torn parts of his shirt. The young man took a tissue out of his bag and wiped his face. </p>
<p>'Too trusting.' He said to the driver. 'You should be ashamed of yourself.' He dropped the tissue into the car and went round to the drivers side. The young man broke the window and reached through, grabbing the driver by the neck and squeezing him. There was a brief struggle. The young man stood up and and rubbed at the scratch on his face. Fucking typical he thought. </p>
<p>He stretched and looked around. Dawn was still a good few hours away. And the car really was very nice. He opened the door and hauled the driver out. There was a bog about a mile from here. He'd got the lay of the land memorised. He sighed and pulled the driver onto his shoulder in a fireman's lift. Time was a-wasting. </p>

<h4>[WP]Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?</h4>
<p>Score: 9</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Time Traveling <em>Hitler Death-a-thon</em>, Mrs. Jacklyn D'Angelo!"</p>
<p>The crowd erupted into an applause as Jacklyn, mostly called Jackie around the Hall, walked onto stage, smiling and waving proudly as she did. She wore a red dress that seemed to accent her blonde hair and her blue eyes seemed tired, but she was older than many expected, in her late 30's. She walked straight to the center of the stage, shook hands with the host and then took a seat, but the crowd continued to applaud. </p>
<p>"Wow," the host said over the wave of applause, "This has been the longest applause since I started hosting."</p>
<p>Jackie couldn't help but smile, she was proud of her accomplishments, and by the looks of it, so were the people.</p>
<p>"Okay folks! Let's settle down here," the host said. He used his hands to try and calm the audience down. Eventually, they subsided, but there were still a few people out there clapping and yelling when he tried to continue.</p>
<p>"I love you Jacklyn!" One man called out form the crowd and she waved to him and blew a kiss.</p>
<p>"Quite the welcome home party. Welcome back Mrs. D'Angelo."</p>
<p>"Please," she said, "call me Jackie."</p>
<p>He smiled, "Jackie it is! Welcome back, how has the past year treated you?"</p>
<p>She nodded, "Oh, all well and good. I took some photo ops, had a little down time, and carefully trained this years contestant."</p>
<p>"Over at the Hall, that is correct?"</p>
<p>Jackie crossed her legs, "Correct. He was chosen a few years ago, was in my class actually when we graduated together. I just had the fortune of going <em>before</em> him."</p>
<p>"And before him you did! You had one of the best kills in the history of Death-a-thon." The host pulled out a card and began to read from it, "Most creative, most difficult, most lengthy, most surprising, most planned, and last but not least, most saved."</p>
<p>She smiled, "I did my best to plan every moment of it."</p>
<p>"And plan you did! Can you take us through some of your processes," the host turned to the camera, "without spoiling this years' fun now!"</p>
<p>"Of course I can!" She laughed a bit as she stood up, "May I stand?"</p>
<p>The host stood with her and opened his arm, he nodded."</p>
<p>Jackie stood up, her red dress reflecting with the stages' spotlight, "Well, at the Hall we have very specific rules as to when you can and cannot kill Adolf Hitler." She leaned to the host, "Meaning you can't kill him as a baby and ruin all the fun."</p>
<p>The host laughed.</p>
<p>She turned back to the audience, "If you don't know much about him pre-Time Traveling Days, we have a whole course on it at the Hall, but the basic sum is that he consolidated power, used his charisma to his advantage, and then began something known as World War Two. A foreign concept to us now, but a concept all the less." She began to pace on stage, "He began this War with an invasion of our dear friends Poland in 1939, and went from there. In 1941, the US of A entered the war with the Attack on Pearl Harbor, a naval base in that timeline. Now, I know things can get confusing, but stay with me.</p>
<p>"In 1944, America invaded Europe, after strategic victories in the Pacific against Japan, yes, they sided with Germany, and began to run down on the Third Reich. On April 30th, 1945, Adolf Hitler, after realizing the war was lost, took his own life."</p>
<p>She nodded, "So when the Death-a-thon first started, fifteen years ago, clear rule were set out on when the death of Hitler had to be." She shrugged, "It was established that the dates from January of 1939 to March of 1945 would be the stretch. No time before, and obviously," she grinned, "no time afterward."</p>
<p>"But the rules never stated when you could begin that planning," the host interjected and Jackie clapped her hands.</p>
<p>"Precisely! So when I graduated, I knew exactly what I was going to do when I was called up for my turn." Jackie smiled and turned to the big screen, where as she pointed to it, a large photo of Adolf Hitler and <em>her</em> turned up. On their wedding day together. "I was going to get close to Adolf, marry him, and eventually kill him."</p>
<p>The crowd erupted into applause, it was unlike the other Champions to do so much planning for one kill. Hell, Jackie was the only person in the 22nd century to have spent a majority of her life in the 20th century. She was proud of that fact.</p>
<p>"And you did gain his friendship, his trust, his love, and eventually marry him."</p>
<p>"Well," she cocked her head, "as the picture shows of course I did!" She laughed, "I traveled back in the 20's, and although it was hard to get close to him, I did. The next twenty years, I was at his side and his confidante. But, before the attack on Pearl Harbor, I had my greatest act."</p>
<p>The host turned to the audience, "Unfortunately, we do not have footage of that act. Jackie, unlike her predecessors, chose to do it in silence as opposed to a worldwide show."</p>
<p>Jackie held up her hands, "I know I know, I'm <em>terrible</em>, but it was for good reason. I needed his death to look like an accident, so I could hold out until the Hall came and picked me up." She went back and took a seat.</p>
<p>The host sat with her, "Could you tell us how it happened? The history books only tell us that he was found dead in his home on January 1st, 1941."</p>
<p>Jackie leaned in close, "Well, that's what the history books say." She leaned back again and shrugged, "They don't mention the gas that was in his home when they found him, or the charred corpse of a man who didn't have the time to go mad."</p>
<p>The whole crowd erupted into applause, thousands of people clapping at Jackie's elaborate show of intrigue and death. They all knew the story of Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, but the story changed with Jackie's entrance as her and the story changed. The history books now, the ones people had read for the last year, told a heart-warming story of Jackie's intervention and the eventual death of a man who would keep on dying.</p>

<p>Score: 9</p>
<p>Thank you all so much! </p>
<p>I wasn’t sure I had a shot, but after reading all your comments, I really appreciate the compliments, especially from past winners. It wasn’t easy convincing Jesus to kill Hitler, but your kind words make spending all that vacation time worth it!</p>
<p>Last year, Janelle forwarded me on your email chain about the contest ─ reading Van Minh’s story about flooding the Fuhrerbunker with beer had me rolling on the floor laughing my ass off. I’m just glad I was at home; I don’t think my coworkers would’ve appreciated it (you excepted, Janelle!)</p>
<p>Aside from wondering how in the world you find that much beer (and transport it!) while the Russians are shelling Berlin, I was naturally wondering how the hell I could get involved and top you, Van Minh. </p>
<p>I mean, here I am working for a history-acquisition NGO; I don’t have the resources to rent a gate, let alone a private gate off Grand Central. When I started by paging through the runners-up, I thought I'd be content to just daydream ─ until I hit on Charlie Wilkers’ story of getting Stalin to kill Hitler.</p>
<p>It was way down in the weeds; you all thought it was a cop-out to use modern tech to transport and set up the “Battle of the Moustaches,” as he put it, but I thought Charlie had a pretty good idea. (Charlie, I’m going to be at this year’s Parallels Conference in Grand Central ─ if you’re there, I owe you a drink!)</p>
<p>Thing was, I had to figure out how to <em>trump</em> Charlie’s idea. I couldn't just steal it, and like a lot of you, I wanted to restrict myself to <em>after</em> Hitler came to power. It's never cool to kill an innocent Schicklgruber, right? My first thought was to get someone like Gandhi to do the deed in the Fuhrerbunker. I mean, they’re both contemporaries; his pacifism aside, it shouldn’t take much to convince him to pull a trigger against Hitler, right?</p>
<p>But as I was thinking about Gandhi, I started figuring how I could trump that. I mean, that’s the beauty of our fractal universe, right? You dig deep enough, scan with enough precision, you can find a Parallel where time flows at just the right rate to get the person you want.</p>
<p>Instead of Gandhi, why not George Washington? What about Genghis Khan? Hell, look to the recent past ─ get Boy George or Mother Theresa, John Paul II or Ringo Starr. Why not Jesus H. Christ himself?
That idea gave me the excited stomach-quivers when it hit me, and I just had to figure out how to make it happen.
Once we won the UCLA contract to recover Louvain’s library, I thought I had a shot. I’m a modernist ─ I usually work from the 18th through the late 20th centuries ─ so the Louvain thing was a big deal for Palimpsest (and thus me!)</p>
<p>It was a hairy recovery, and I got a lot of comp vacation. That gave me the time, and once Sheri Young over at XCursions heard my plan, she volunteered her gate to let me try. (I definitely owe you more than a drink, Sheri!)</p>
<p>XCursions isn’t a fancy place ─ they don’t even have a drivable or walkable gate. It’s a straight foot-first shot, a tube blasting you through a portal as small as humanly possible, and I’d have to be back in two weeks. </p>
<p>George Metrokin is Palimpsest’s guide to the Biblical Levant ─ you might know him from one of those National Geographic specials about searching for “the real” Jesus ─ and he came along for the ride. He was as tickled with the idea as I was, and he volunteered to go. That was a good thing, since I don’t speak Aramaic naturally; I had to rely on a translator earpiece and makee-lookee dumb show to get along otherwise.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re thinking this whole idea is sacrilegious, you might be right ─ but this guy wasn’t “our” Jesus. I mean, how many Jesus specials have you seen? There’s a literally infinite number of universes out there, and I mean, we’ve seen fiery preacher Jesuses, we’ve seen humble angelic-looking guys, we’ve seen female Jesuses, Asian Jesuses, fighting Jesuses, pacifist Jesuses … One of the jokes at Palimpsest is that there’s never a shortage of funding for efforts to go find “the real” Jesus. The Levant at the start of the first millennium is practically the best-explored thing in the multiverse aside from all the knuckleheads going to visit (and be disappointed by) the “library” of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Anyway, we spent a week walking (and riding) around Israel ─ yeah, I know it’s anachronistic to call it that, but who cares? ─ before we found the guy, doing his normal hillside preaching thing.</p>
<p>We played our part hard and fast, as astrologers/mystics from far away who’d heard about Jesus and his preaching and were hoping he could help us with a little problem we had.</p>
<p>Our Jesus was a pretty gullible guy ─ he must’ve been drinking his own Kool-Aid and actually listening to himself preach ─ and so he was happy to help the “noble foreigners” with their problem. It helped that we convinced him that Hitler was killing Jews in his home country (see kids, a little truth never hurt anyone).</p>
<p>We tried teaching Jesus to shoot ─ and wasn’t that a hoot! </p>
<p>He couldn’t aim worth a damn, so we decided to switch to a backup plan and give him a flamethrower instead. This was one of those World War II models, with a backpack, hand lever and point-and-click action. He had a whale of a time with it practicing in the desert before our pickup gate opened.</p>
<p>Sheri had us picked up and ready to de-port to the Fuhrerbunker before Jesus got hit by culture shock too bad. One of the things I picked up from notes left by you guys and gals is that the Fuhrerbunker tends to get smoky or filled with fumes pretty darn quick, so we all wore SCBAs to ward off the smoke.</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how quick pre-industrial folks pick up on modern tech. I mean, we design it to be user-friendly, but it just goes to show that the stuff works even if you don’t know how it works.</p>
<p>Anyway, we came out of the gate with guns (and flamethrower) blazing. The hard part was actually keeping Jesus from getting too enthusiastic with the damn flamethrower. He almost fried us a few times, until we turned it down almost to a candle-flame. George and I kept down covering fire to protect Jesus (and that was another hoot ─ playing Secret Service for Jesus!) </p>
<p>The whole thing took about two and a half months to plan, two and a half weeks to arrange, then two and a half minutes to actually happen. I’ve linked the Go-Pro footage for you if you want (it’s damn gory stuff), and we got Hitler with his dog and most of the SS higher-ups, too.</p>
<p>After it was all over, we dropped Jesus back off in his home Parallel, and George and I got back home.</p>
<p>It was Jesus in the bunker with the flamethrower, and that’s a winning strategy!</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>An old, white, Lincoln town car spurts and sputters down Route 66. This old machine is more rust then steel and it sounds like it runs off glue the way it glugs and chugs down the road. The man behind the wheel has rim horn glasses, a fitted black suit ad tie, and a silver watch with leather strap. He is out of place in this damn place and in this damn car.

As the headlights flicker with every bounce down the neglected stretch of tarmac the well-dressed man spots something smoking on the side of the road. He slowly down to a crawl and as he approaches he notices its an old, black Lincoln town car with its hood popped and steam pouring from the rusted configuration. A well-dressed lady, with a dress that hugs her curves and a purse that costs more than that car clinging to her delicate shoulder. The well-dressed man motions for her to hop in, he pats the seat, and with a smile the well-dressed woman is in.

She buckles up and turns. At the same time they say, &quot;Thanks&quot;. Both are holding a revolver in hand. At first their eyes are wide and fixated on the what the other is holding. No more words are exchanged, but there is no need. She unbuckles herself, goes back to her black Lincoln, and he continues to fume down the road with only a glance in his rear view mirror.

He has been shot, stabbed, bludgeoned, poisoned, incinerated, drowned, blown up, strangled, and crushed. He has had his bones replaced with a nanotech skeleton at least a dozen times. He has been framed as a Jew. He has been genetically rewritten <em>into</em> a Jew. Several times he has been turned black. On one occasion, the entire Nazi leadership was sent further back in time and dropped right in front of invading Mongol hordes. On three separate occasions he has been eaten by dinosaurs.</p>
<p>It is an honor to stand here before such an assembly of Hitler-killing heroes and fans. Heroes, it is your tireless efforts that, death by death, bring Adolf Hitler closer to justice. Fans, it is your dedication and support that allow us to keep doing this - to keep bringing this villain to justice. So, to both heroes and fans, I say thank you. I truly could not have pulled off this run without you.</p>
<p>To explain why my run unfolded the way it did, I'd like to start by talking about the scoring system. In this competition, points are awarded for creativity, difficulty, and justice. For instance, runs involving sending nuclear bombs back in time to blow up Hitler at a known place and time - along with the rest of the town - are, apart from the cost of the bomb itself, fairly easy to arrange, pretty straightforward to devise and execute, and pretty much guaranteed to kill more innocent people than Nazis. The nuke strategy has given us some of the lowest point scores in the history of the game. By contrast, high scoring approaches involve higher degrees of creativity, like redesigning buildings to ensure Hitler's death, significant difficulty, like talking Hitler into killing himself, and justice - the more poetic the better - like last year's winner, who abducted Hitler, starved and shaved him, and dropped him in a concentration camp to die by his own order.</p>
<p>So, by raw facts, I did not kill Hitler. I did not directly plan Hitler's demise. I did not even go back as far as when he was alive, let alone further. But I am here on points, because I understand the game.</p>
<p>Instead of going directly to Hitler, I went back only about seventy years. in fact, I went to 2178, to the Cheetos High Energy Physics lab. I walked in the door, ate a doughnut that hadn't been cooked yet, and convinced Dr. Helmut Haire to travel back in time to kill Hitler. I watched him sacrifice his live in the attempt, and sent the recordings of his run - the first human time travel run, and the first run to try to kill Hitler - to the news media. I posted it on the CyberDugg, and on 23gag, and 90chan, and all of those old sites. I posted relentlessly, and still by the end of the week Dr. Haire was a hero. A celebrity martyr who had recognized the significance of his invention and used it to try to destroy the most evil man in recent memory.</p>
<p>Once the image was set firmly in the public consciousness, I used the knowledge of business deals that hadn't happened yet and political secrets that hadn't yet come to light to fund and to clear obstacles from in front of the true meat of my plan. I set into motion a plan to kill Hitler not once, but again and again, bringing him to justice in new and creative ways. </p>
<p>Heroes and fans, allow me to introduce myself in a new way. I am not only the winner of this year's Kill Hitler prize. You also know me as Gunther O. Schnapp, the founder of the Kill Hitler Competition.</p>
<p>Thank you. For everything."</p>

<p>I had to get it out. There had to be some way of doing it without changing things, without making it go away. </p>
<p>I wandered the streets, days must have passed though they didn't. Then weeks then months but time has no meaning when nothing changes. Nothing has any meaning when nothing changes. </p>
<p>I had stopped questioning why it was happening to me. Those were thoughts of other men of other times. As usual I had been less than sober when the writing appeared on my arm and I hadn't wanted to be sober since. It's easy to rob liquor stores when no one is looking. Everything is easier when nobody's looking except looking at yourself. </p>
<p>That was the beginning. Few questions and fewer thoughts. But then I had a moment of clarity, you see, and I realized that I had to act. It all depended on me, that was what the letters were telling me. It was all in my hands. </p>
<p>I took to the streets once again to look for a tattoo parlor. I had never put my feet inside one before, I had thought myself better than those posers and thieves. There's nothing like a good old chronostasis to get you thinking about other things though. </p>
<p>I found some needles but they were filthy with blood. I looked for a long time, and there I go again with the time, but old habits die hard, and I looked for a long time and then it was there. The filthy blood was all I had and with it I started scratching. Time-freezes freeze electricity too, it seems, for I couldn't make it work. That's when I took the needle to my skin. It tickled at first, then it itched and then I moaned with pain. </p>
<p>Saving humanity is no simple thing. </p>
<p>Little by little I managed to scratch out the upper layers of my skin but still the words shone mocking red. I dug deeper and even through my drunken stupor it was excruciating. But still the message persisted. It was seared into my bones. </p>
<p>I was frantic at this point. There wasn't enough time. I had to save them. I looked around me inside the cluttered shop and then I found my solution. </p>
<p>A red axe hung by the window. Don't ask me why. I think it was planted there. I took it and I took my arm. It's harder than one thinks to chop of your own arm with your axe but you should be able to imagine it now. A great enterprise. </p>
<p>I don't know how many heartbeats passed. Yes, that's a change. That's time. The heartbeats. They putt putt putt and putter and putt even when the world stops turning. </p>
<p>The second my arm fell away it started once again. I was free. The frozen man by the window thawed then. He looked at me like I had quite gone mad. </p>
<p>"What are you doing, man? Don't you know the world is ending?" His voice was plain, wooden. Wooden like his face. </p>
<p>"I know. I've been spending a lifetime trying to make sure it happens too. Why won't you come over here and give me a hand?" </p>

<p>It was mid October, slightly before the "scariest" day on earth; Halloween. How fitting that the one time I actually <em>had</em> a costume, the world was going to end before I got to wear it. Not that people especially cared though, they were mostly focused on bucket lists, those things they all wanted to do before they died, <strong>we</strong> all died. It was too late for me though, we'd known about this for almost two years - A giant rock, a planet, floating lazily into us. I'd been a salesman at a pet shop before the announcement, I couldn't just leave them all though, so I stuck around for the first few months. Some people were upfront; "I've always wanted to try cat before". Disgusting. Eventually I gave up - just brought what was left back home. My landlord complained at first, but eventually he too left on his "World Tour", just never came back. Were planes even still flying these days? I'd be surprised.</p>
<p>Governments had tried to salvage something but mistakes, split budgets, worker shortage, had all made it impossible to really get a plan into action. I heard Russia sent up a shuttle to the moon, but nobody really knows much more than that, or at least nobody I talked to.</p>
<p>So here I am, home, surrounded by everyone that really mattered to me. How depressing. I closed my eyes for the final time; a final cat nap before the end of the world.</p>
<p>I looked at my clock - 3:43pm</p>
<p>"That's a bit strange" I said aloud. It was probably at this point that I realized my apartment was a bit more quiet than I'd ever heard it. My words hung in the air, a small echo.</p>
<p>No Squawks. Meows. Barks. These were normal sounds. These sounds were not there.</p>
<p>It was when I reached for my door-handle that I noticed the text - "however long it takes, save us" - in comic sans. Cute.</p>
<p>At first I wasn't really sure what to do. I could interact with anything, pick it up, move it around, I could more-or-less will something to normal. Or the weird state of normal I was in.</p>
<p>The first few days were mostly testing. How many objects, people, things, could I keep going at once, could I force something back into time-lock, did other people know what was going on?</p>
<p>More or less, it looked like 1 person at a time, or infinitely many objects, or at least as close to infinity as smashing that bottle of change on my dresser. Had to be like, 100 bucks in there of just pennies and nickles.</p>
<p>Anyway. The president didn't know what was going either. Frankly he asked too many questions for my liking. It's a shame I didn't have a girlfriend, probably would have made for better company then the current scientist I'm working with.</p>
<p>Andrew. The first one that didn't scream when I unfroze him. Very cool, calm. So far he's only asked me the important questions, he's been the perfect helper. He and I are re-building the Saturn V rocket. He's apparently a pretty big rocket buff and this is the one he likes the most. I'm learning a lot just by working with him, but I can tell that this is going to be a long process. Good thing I've got all the time I need! I looked at my watch again today. Bad habit. 3:43pm. Of all the objects I work with everyday, I leave this one just as it is, a reminder of the work I need to complete.</p>
<p>A few months, years, decades, pass by uneventfully. We've got most of the parts here, and for the things we don't, we collect. The drives are probably the longest part of this. One time I forgot a couple very <em>particular</em> washers a few states over. I'm human, you know, I make mistakes. Well without them Andrew wasn't going to be able to keep going. He ended up coming with me "in case we needed anything else". Ha. He ended up just complaining the whole way there. But he was Andrew, my only friend in this "world". I could have just frozen him, just for a few minutes of silence, but it seemed to me that I probably deserved it.</p>
<p>Either way, after a few more decades, it was upright, in place, and ready to launch.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure why we built a space faring vessel instead of a missile, but Andrew said we could just bring a payload with us. Made sense. I'm not really a thinker though.</p>
<p>Really though, of all the people on this planet, they choose me. Why not someone like Andrew? Hell he's basically handling this on his own anyways, I'm just the mojo for him to be not-as-frozen-as-everyone-else.</p>
<p>Andrew snapped his fingers in my face. "Hey" he grinned. "We're all loaded up, 10 of the largest warheads known to mankind. Let's get this rocket a movin'"</p>
<p>I took one last look at the rocket. She was ugly as sin. Mismatched metal made for atmospheric exit only; this was a one way trip for us. The unknown saviors of the planet. I thought about leaving a note or something, but it's not like they could praise me. I chuckled. I guess I'm a benevolent god.</p>
<p>As I strapped myself to the chair and flicked open the cover on the initiate button, I looked over to Andrew. "Are we really going to land this ship on the planet and <strong>then</strong> blow it up?"</p>
<p>"It's the only way to be sure they go off in the right spots, you know that. You're the one who has to set the timer and then unfreeze them."</p>
<p>I shrugged "I just thought it would be more <em>spectacular</em> or something."</p>
<p>"You're sitting in a 40 year old rocket, on your way to an unknown planet in space, with over 400 megatons of explosive material on a stopwatch, and nobody will ever know. Spectacular is an understatement."</p>
<p>I pushed the button.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, everything happened exactly as it was supposed to. Andrew had made meticulous checks and re-checks of everything. It was a straight shot thankfully, and the small deviations we're all handled by the computer. We arrived to it just shy of a day later.</p>
<p>Stepping out onto the planet was...different. It had more gravity than I thought it would. The ground was solid, clear. It was like walking on a garden path rather than on a pile of dust like I expected. I suppose it was flying through space, so maybe it got dusted off? I barely understood how rocket fuel worked and I spent 6 months making the stuff. I shrugged. Not like it really matters.</p>
<p>I grabbed the first bomb and loaded it up onto the wheel assembly. We'd found a few cavern entrances on the surface where we wanted to land. A stationary target is pretty easy to hit.</p>
<p>I walked into the first cave, with Andrew driving the little rover, it was a tight fit, but we were confident that the tunnel was our ticket to drop-zone 1.</p>
<p>The cave on the other hand, had no such predication. Each time we found a suitable spot, we decided that they could be a better one just ahead. We had time, so why not? I stumbled. The clear pathway I had been walking for almost an hour suddenly had a rock on it. It was so out of character for the uniform...ish... cave that this was the first real rock I'd seen so far. I picked it up. Is that...Moss? Space Moss?</p>
<p>Andrew was as surprised as I was when he took a look. Nothing he'd ever seen before. We elected to scout ahead. If there was moss here, then maybe we'd get the rover stuck if we went to far forward. We only had one, so it was important to keep it going.</p>
<p>The further we went, the thicker the moss got. Wall, ceiling, it didn't matter. I saw a light up ahead, but not natural light. It had a purple hue to it. Andrew suggested bio-luminescence. Sure. Lets go with that.</p>
<p>We reached the purple light, but it wasn't anything like we expected. In fact, it was a button that said "Push". Written right there. In English. On the surface of a planet nobody had ever been to before. In Comic Sans. I did what any self-respecting human would have done. I pushed it.</p>
<p>A door slid open and the purple light increased. We turned off our lights and stepped in.</p>
<p>In the center of the room lay a floating ball of light - honestly it looked like something out of Star Trek. The room was circular, with little benches on the walls gradually climbing to the ceiling. Tiers and tiers of them. Movement caught my eye. That was a strange sensation.</p>
<p>Wait. Movement?</p>
<p>I looked at Andrew, and he was clearly there, right in the spot where he was 10 seconds before. I looked back. Two little eyes peeked over one of the upper benches. I didn't really know what to do. Something in those eyes reminded me of an animal, a domesticated cat or dog perhaps. I shook my head. I must be seeing things.</p>
<p>"Are you here to save us? We have been waiting"</p>

<p>They say 3rd time is the charm, does the same hold true for 3 lifetimes?</p>
<p>Every time I wake up I'm expecting to be another person. Death just has a way of sneaking up on you. It provokes anxiety, since remembering your own death can be too sobering in a way. It sucks, and I had to do it not just once but twice. I find it so strange that I'm the only human that is able to remember variations of myself.</p>
<p>As it holds true that my old enemy in the French legion seems to forget himself, he never appears the way I want or expect him to. Once he betrayed me and exiled me to that Godforsaken island. The second time I was so focused on watching my back I lost sight of what was in front of me. Both times I held the world at its' throat and both times it slipped through my fingers.</p>
<p>Not this time, this time the Cold Country will be mine. The White Jewel will be the pedestal from which I make my grand return. The first time I was too cocksure, the second too anxious. It seems history has a way of repeating itself, jumping the gun is my biggest failure. </p>
<p>So I have learnt, good things come to those who wait supposedly. Twice now I've cycled a 129 year period, that's more than two and a half centuries. I think I've been patient enough.</p>
<p>They say 3rd time is the charm, does the same hold true for the annihilation of a country?</p>
<p>After careful analysis I realize that my biggest asset is not just my military mind but my ability to manipulate. So this time I started from the inside. Now here I am the CEO of the biggest Fusion Safety organization in the world. Standing on a mountain of promised global safety. I have shaken the foundations of the Geneva convention and redefined what weapons are. I have removed several countries as a threat through bureaucracy alone. I have proven what weapons of mass destruction are capable of. </p>
<p>I have shown these people what war would look like if it got out of hand, what they just don't realize is I've been prophesizing their future to them. Every country that has surrendered their Fusion Weapons to me has made me stronger and today I'm finally ready to show these people what it means to be ruled. </p>
<p>I believe the only reason why I can remember my destiny is because I'm the only one that can succeed in this. Some deity saw it fit to grant me another chance, I will not squander this one.</p>

<p>Score: 7</p>
<p>The hour struck midnight and the vision disappeared. So he lay down in bed again and waited to wake up from this strange dream. Seven sons? Even the thought of four children seemed absurd. </p>
<p>He looked over at his girlfriend sleeping fitfully beside him. Even in his dreams she was always worn out. The two of them had too many plans for their lives for many children, Even the thought of one was a far distant hope; once she got her promotion and his business took off, then yes, but seven? </p>
<p>Curling in the blankets he lazily imagined why this sort of dream would even come about? Then his mind traveled slowly over the struggle they had both overcome to get there. All the long nights working to pay through collage; her unpaid internship and waitress job, his donating plasma and . . . </p>
<p>Suddenly he sat up, sweating despite the chill that had crept up his spine. He had been a sperm donor. </p>
<hr />
<p>His focus was shaken by the sound of his girlfriend’s alarm. His eyes stung from the sleepless night on the computer, trying to dig up his rights, trying to find where his seed had been sown. </p>
<p>It wasn’t until that moment that he realized that he hadn’t woken up. It hadn’t been a dream. She was blearily getting out of bed as he pulled his clothing on. He only paused to give her a kiss before running out the door, she was too sleepy to ask where.</p>
<hr />
<p>His college town was four hours away. It was still dark outside as he tore down the nearly empty highway. By the time he arrived, the clinic was just opening. He had to develop a plan, an excuse at the desk to see the information. He thanked his past self for deciding to not be anonymous.</p>
<p>After some tears and lies about genetic diseases and a change in religion, he got to see the files. He flipped through pages of happy couples and their pudgy faced children, all of them faintly resembling the photos over his parent’s mantels. It wasn’t until he turned to the last page that he gave a sign of relief. Six, only six children.</p>
<p>With new, more genuine tears, he requested his samples be terminated. The nurses were gracious and assured him that it would be done before the day was out. </p>
<hr />
<p>It was noon by the time he crept into their apartment. She would be at work for another several hours, he could catch up on sleep. The premonition had been a warning, saving him from a fate he couldn’t have even imagined.</p>
<p>But as he lay down on their bed, not even bothering to undress, he realized how ridiculous it had all been. The strange fear from some strange almost dream, it sounded more like a plot for one of his books than reality.</p>
<p>As he was about to close his eyes, he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. She was calling him. Blearily he answered and half listened as she began talking rapidly. She sounded so happy, so excited, almost on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>“Did you get the promotion?” He asked softly.</p>
<p>“No, not yet,” she said, “I’m pregnant.”</p>

<h4>[WP]Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?</h4>
<p>Score: 7</p>
<p>It was hard coming up with new ways to kill Hitler for sport. It always has been. How is one supposed to balance the sadism of sport murder, the glee of killing Hitler, and the creativity to impress a panel of judges. </p>
<p>The first bunch of victors had used the classic time travel cliches and paradoxes. Killing his parents, killing him as a child, making his death look like the historic suicide that it was, and other things like that. After the judges grew tired of this the next group tended to be those that focused on historical events, most were fixing botched assassination attempts or killing him at famous speeches. And after this comes to where we are in the competition right now, the absurdist deaths. These murders became the most popular starting six years ago. The debut of the absurdist death came when an absolute genius decided to kill him by dropping him off a cliff Wile E Coyote style, scream and everything.</p>
<p>Ever since the absurdist deaths started becoming popular I knew that if I were to win, I'd have to do something over the top. The problem I had was that I was burdened with being Jewish. I just couldn't bring myself to kill him in a goofy way. </p>
<p>I looked back at previous victors, looking for what had worked, if there was a secret to winning the judges over. I saw nothing specific other than the basic history of the competition that I just mentioned. Then, I noticed something, not about the murders, but about the murderers. I know this sounds like it's from a bad coming of age movie, but I saw that the victorious murders had just done what they did best. Writers used the time travel cliches to win, historians used historical events to, and comedians used humor to win. </p>
<p>So what did I have going for me? Well, I was Jewish. However, this was nothing new, comedians had taken over recently and comedy has been lousy with Jews for hundreds of years. I've always had a proclivity for for writing, I wouldn't be writing this otherwise. The only thing I seemed to have was my knowledge of previous competitions. So I decided to do something a little different, more drawn out, and a mix of different styles.</p>
<p>I first thing I did was find a time when Hitler was alone with a single Gestapo. I ambushed the two, I killed the officer for his uniform and gun and I captured the defenseless Hitler. I took him to a remote location and knocked him unconscious. I removed his famous mustache and hair, but saved them. They would be important later. I changed him into the clothes I had been wearing and I put on the Gestapo uniform.</p>
<p>The next step was to take him to the most famous camp of all, Auschwitz. He woke up in the sleeping quarters of Auschwitz very shocked. The first thing he saw was the Gestapo's gun with a note attached. It said 'This gun is for you and you only. You can use it on yourself or you will not use it at all. The choice is yours, will you use it or not?' in German. He grabbed the gun and immediately pointed it at the other prisoners, screaming that he was Hitler, he would not be held here any longer. This woke up not only the prisoners but also the guards. The guards did not take kindly to what appeared to them to be a bald, Jewish prisoner proclaiming that he was Hitler with a gun in his hand. They rushed him. As soon as Hitler saw this I used the time machine to jump in, grab the gun, and teleport back out in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>He was dragged away to a big truck. One of the variants of the gas showers that the Nazis had was an eighteen-wheeler that just had a pipe connecting the exhaust to the chamber in the back, suffocating all those inside. They threw him in and started the truck. I watched as he suffocated, waiting for the moment where he was about to die and then taking him back to when he woke up less than 30 minutes ago. </p>
<p>He saw the note, the gun, and where he was. He repeated his first set of actions about eight or nine times. After that he tried acting normally, like he was just another Jew. This seemed to work at first, but I had done my planning. It was the day for his group of prisoners to be gassed. Either way he would die. It took him about thirty more tries to exhaust all of the ideas that he had to escape the Groundhog's Day-esque nightmare scenario that he had been placed in. He had made it to forty three escape failures before waking up on the forty fourth morning and reading the note I had placed on the gun again. He threw the note to the ground and stuck the gun in his mouth.</p>
<p>This was the moment of truth, where I chose to be a winner or a failure. I jumped in, forced Hitler into a time-stasis, and pulled him into the machine. I put his mustache, hair, and uniform back on and took him to the only place that felt right. Back to where he had historically committed suicide. I had captured Hitler, driven him insane, gotten him to the point of suicide, and brought him to the place where he had actually committed suicide. At the time, I had assumed that I won and well, the rest is history.</p>

The screen switched between a live feed and The “Earth Union” that had sprung up after NASA had discovered the planet hurdling towards us. Funny what can happen when you all know you are going to die. You start working together, doing anything to save yourself. Wars basically stopped, although terrorist groups took advantage of the chaos and much of Europe was gone, not that it mattered as we would all be dead in 24 hours anyway. The TV would keep broadcasting until the last second, and most were watching it as what else could you really do? Henry had already emailed or texted everyone he ever knew, as the phones was down due to the heavy traffic. Some cults had started, many suicides were found, and the government was going to start handing out Suicide pills around hour 12 worldwide. The Earth was going to get really hot before we all died, and those of us against suicide would be in for hell of hot time. We probably would have wished we had taken them when our skin starts to melt off. All the world’s leaders in the Earth Union were giving epic speeches, though most of us hated the Earth Union. After serval dozen attempts at trying to stop the planet, they had resorted to building “an arc” where all the rich/famous and officials will board as well as astronauts and all matters of scientists. , along with frozen and of all earth’s species, will leave Earth around hour 12 for good. They will be bound for mars, and will try and make a home there. The rest of us get to die.
Hour twelve comes by and the Arc launches. It doesn’t even make it half way before a nuke explodes. The cameras fill with white and he can hear his wife cry out in shock, and his two kids start to cry. Henry closes his eyes. Now everyone smart is dead and the world will end. Way to go terrorists, you certainly got what you wanted. 
Henry looks around, the final moments of his life. His wife had served lemonade and unknown to him it had crushed pills in it. She had served it with a smile to his kids and offered him one, but he had declined. They drank as they watched the timer count down to zero. It wouldn’t happen exactly at zero, but the gravitational pull would mess up our power system or whatever, and everything would go silent until it was over. He saw it hit zero and he held the glass of lemonade. The President, god bless him had stayed behind as he wanted to comfort the nation until the TV stopped broadcasting. His final words were “Though I walk through the valley of death…” he didn’t even finish as it hit zero. Henry took a swig of the lemonade and rested his head on his wife’s still warm lap, his kids sleeping peacefully by her feet.
He woke up a few hours later, confused as hell. It was 6am on October 25th, 2015. That’s what the clock said. The TV showed the same image as when he had last closed his eyes: The President in the Rose Garden reading from a bible. Confused he went outside and knocked on his neighbor’s house door, one he knew that was sticking around. With no answer he opened it up, “Hello, Jeff? He said, entering the house, going to the living room. Jeff was frozen with his family, watching the TV with the same image on it. “Hello, Jeff?” he said, his voice full of wonder as he moved his hand in front of his eyes, clapped, yelled, but no movement came. 
With sudden pain his arm reddened, and in cursive it wrote directly into his flesh, “however long it takes, save us".” Henry looked at it, his mind boggled. This was all too much.
Day 2.
Henry was discovering new things about his frozen state. For one, he never felt tired or hungry. He hadn’t even though of food and he hadn’t eaten since Zero Day. Also, he could still move things, and internet, power, and everything worked. He had posted all over the net and on reddit, but nothing was being responded too, has he had come to learn, all humans were frozen. He could move them and touch them, and they were still warm to the touch. He made a decision early on that he would not mess with anyone. After all, his arm had said “save us.” Not “rape us.” 
After the initial shock, he spent days in grieving, for his family was dead, and yet here he was, still alive, trying to save the world… but what did it matter if he had nothing left to come back too?
Day 5
Henry hadn’t thought of documenting anything until after visiting his Brother. He was still alive and well, with his family huddled around him. “I won’t let you down, John; I will do this for you. Just because I lost everything, doesn’t mean you have too. I have… forever, I think” he said to his unmoving Brother.
Day 100
“A 100 days! “ Henry exclaimed to no one in particular. He had spent 100 days doing nothing except on his computer. Ever imagine what you could get done if you didn’t need to sleep or eat, or have any pesky people bothering you? Henry was building a network of ideas. He wasn’t the brightest guy but he had gone to college, and the first thing he knew what he should do is brain storm. How the hell do you stop a gigantic planet headed for earth? He had a couple of benefits that NASA and the Earth Union didn’t have: Time.  He could do anything now to get rid of it, after all, according to his scar he had unlimited time. This gave him options that no one had even considered. At first he went to the obvious thing: Get all the nukes and launch them at it. Then he had considered what might happen if it did blow up. So he had started learning computer modeling, code, and programming. It would take time as Henry had never been the technical type.
Day 562
He now had a more thorough understanding of the planet. Henry was at Titan, the super computer cluster in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It too had been already working on simulations of it impacting earth, but Henry had modified and added to the program, and had simulated blowing up the planet. He had tried it a thousand different ways, but each time the debris still destroyed earth. Right now the planet was about 100,000 miles away from earth. It was travelling at 25,000 miles per hour, and would have destroyed them in about 4 seconds after Zero. One thing he did not know for sure is that if he destroyed it, would time resume? He had to be sure that what he did would work 100%, as he didn’t want to unfreeze time only to fail.
Day 1022
Henry had set Titan on an algorithm that slightly modified the way he would blast the planet, from all angles, with different payloads, or timed explosions or what not. By his estimations, it would take around a decade to through all the feasible ones. In the meantime, Henry decided he needed a break. He had been learning about computers, robots, code, and such nonstop with no breaks for almost three years now. He decided he would re-watch some old movies and play some video games, all the ones he hadn’t had time for as a Father with two kids.
Day 2055
He put down the controller and rubbed his eyes. They didn’t hurt but it was an old habit. Just because he didn’t get tired anymore didn’t mean he would stop getting headaches. He would get them from time to time if he stared at a screen to long or didn’t get up and walk around. He had raided a GameStop and had set up a gaming heaven in a movie theater. He was getting bored; after all gaming alone is not so much fun after you play all the best single player titles. He had watched every movie he could find, and went to a bunch of cool places and seen all the remaining movie stars or famous people. He had also switched off any TV he found as he was sick of looking at the President.   He decided to get back to work. 
Day 2500
Titan had come up with nothing. Every scenario left earth destroyed. It was time to think of something else. He was becoming quite the nerd now, and had set up quite the station in Oakridge Library. Lucky for him none of the hardware seemed to age, whatever was happening had frozen time and objects but still allowed it to pass. It was odd, but he didn’t think about it often now. He was also building a network of computers for a distributed computing powerhouse. He had gone to all the big data centers in the US and installed his software, making use of the infrastructure that was his to use. He had a pretty good network now, and his simulations zipped by quickly, though nothing was working, no matter what he did the planet mass would still destroy earth.
Day 3021
Eight years since he had woken up still alive. At this point he had abandoned anything related to explosives. He was watching Wall-E while reading an e-book on advance A.I., when a brilliant idea came to him. He furiously started typing away at his keyboard, writing code and designing models through CAD. He worked through his headaches as inspiration took over him.</p>

<p>Where to begin ... I guess I should say that I'm thirty-five years old. At least I think im still 35 years old. Time has become a distant memory at this point. A lot of things have become distant memories. I, for example, cannot for the life of me remember where I used to work. I haven't been back there in ages. There's not really been a point. In fact, I don't really see the point in any of this. </p>
<p>I guess I should start at the beginning. When this all started I was 35. Actually if you want to get really technical it all started billions of years before that when Planet Death (officially known as planet PZ-17X) formed. But this is no time to get technical. I had referred to it as Planet Death for about the fifteen or so years prior to my 35th birthday. Oh and that's an interesting side note Planet Death was set to obliterate all life as we know it on my birthday. In fact it was at my birthday party. Come to think of it it was when they brought out my birthday cake. It was weird celebrating a birthday knowing that in just hours we'd all be dead. But what was really weird was celebrating it at 6:50 in the morning because none of the scientific models could accurately predict exactly WHEN life was going to end. See, if Planet Death (wait let's call it PD for short. Hey I kind of like that PD ... Petey.  Well now it has a first name). Anyway if Petey had been smaller it would have crashed into earth and and sent shockwaves all around. But since it was just about as large as Earth it meant that both planets would essentially be ripped apart only to recongeal later as a new planet, with a center of mass at the Langevin point between the two planets. As a result, the models did not know exactly what point in time various points would be affected by this shredding. So my family and friends decided to give me one last birthday party before we got ripped apart. I remember it like it was yesterday, which is somewhat strange to say because I guess it's still technically 7:02 am because nothing has moved since they brought me the cake. </p>
<p>I didn't know what to wish for. I never did. But today it hit me. I just wished that I could stop Petey from killing everyone I knew and then I blew out the candles. All thirty-five of them in one breath. I'd always heard if you didn't get it in one breath then the wish wouldn't come true and I wasn't about to play around once I made my wish. It's weird.  Every once in a while I still walk back to the dining room and toucan see the smoke blowing out from the candles.  I don't know if it was my wish or just random chance or if I have some higher purpose, but I blew out the candles and then Tim just sort of stopped. </p>
<p>I thought I died. I figured Petey had killed us all and that I was in the afterlife. Then I noticed the weird text right on my forearm. At first it was barely legible but then after a while it became almost bright enough to read by.   </p>

It feels like someone is carving it with a knife but there's no tear in my suit. I exit the shuttle and stumble onto the launch platform. </p>

<p>What? What do I do? 
I look to the sky and see the instrument of our destruction poised to destroy everything. I turn to take one more look at my beloved before I set off my journey to save the world. 
I whisper "I won't be long, my love." </p>
<p>... I believe it to be three years later but my concept of time has changed since the sun is always up. Ive found three of the four pieces of eight that could destroy this ghastly rogue planet. I think they are on to me though. The shadows they i see are bit darker now. I think back to my first clues of salvation, I didn't think of it at first but if the world is frozen in time how are shadows moving throughout it? The flashback ends and i see it again the flicker out of the corner of my eye. They're upon, the faceless nemesis that put this rogue devastator in the Earth's path. </p>
<p>Weeks pass and I'm at the final acropolis holding the key to humanity, I haven't slept since San Jose though and its starting to get to me. The task is almost over but will I survive the end? The faces, they haunt me and they won't give me peace. The faces I pass everyday of the people waiting for their salvation that may never come and their shadows ... they hold a dark secret, beings that feast upon destruction that have been waiting silently for me to fail. I reach to 1000 stair and look upon the roots of destruction. Then I freeze with fear the beings that have wrought our destruction are finally willing to face me, they look just like ... me. Hundreds of my face staring me down waiting for me to make the first move. As I step they do too, in unison we slowly reach one another like some sick funhouse mirror trick. We are face to face. I'm face to face with myself... I take the plunge, I run to final piece in the middle of the space being scraped and cut as I do and finally I am brought down. I unison I hear my voice say it is over, this is the end, I am lost, salvation is lost..
I can't give in I must succeed, I crawl to the last piece and throw the other three into it. A beam erupts towards the planet destroying it.. It is done but time is still frozen and copies of me are gone. All except one that says as I get up, "Congratulations we have finally become one, you have wrought the salvation of humanity at the cost of yours. You have become Death and time is forever lost to you. Was it worth it?"</p>

<p>Thanks to the invention of time travel we have learned some amazing things.  Probably, the most amazing thing we learned was that magic was real.  I was in the final year of my PHD program in Magic and in order to get my doctorate I had to kill Hitler using all I had learned.   I found this very ironic being that my specialty was in Jewish curses and magic.  So what magic spell or curse did I use to kill Hitler? What was the most devious and ironic thing I could think of?  It was this:  I put a curse on Hitler that if he spoke anything but Hebrew he would die.  More specifically he had to pray 3 times a day according to Jewish law.  In fact he had to follow all 613 mitzvot, keep Kosher, etc.  I do have to say this for the man, he choose to die rather than utter a word of Hebrew.</p>

I looked at my arm to see a message inscribed; "However long it takes, save us." Knowing that my task was either possible or impossible, and that I had as much time as was needed, I knew that eventually my task would be completed if, in fact, it was possible.

<p>Three-hundred and forty-two years, 8 months, 16 days, 9 hours, 28 minutes, 13 seconds and counting. That was the amount of time, that, unknown to myself, had passed since this curse befell me. It must have taken some genius to design and  concoct such a plan. Some random schmuck, off the streets of Cleveland, Ohio, was supposed to save the world from something that not even the greatest engineers and scientists could?</p>
<p>I had been passed out when it happened. We had all known that we were dead, and I had decided to spend my last day partying with friends, and telling stories we'd kept secret for oh so long with one another, anger curtailed by the fact it didn't do any good to be angry about something that would no longer exist. </p>
<p>Having a tad much to drink, I'd stumbled into the restroom, and passed out on the toilet in the bar we'd chosen to congregate at. I awoke, not more than an hour later, or at least, it felt like that much. I washed my hand, and hit the button on the hand dryer. Whoever had designed the thing that did this to me, failed to realize that nothing electrical would work in this frozen state. </p>
<p>Walking from the restroom, I could see all my friends, frozen in time, looking like much time hadn't passed since i'd left them. Some were busy staring down at their phones, screens frozen in time, bright and shining into their faces in perpetual illumination. Some were drinking, some laughing, and watching the planet that was going to collide with us drawing closer.  </p>
<p>For a few days, I thought I was in a coma, trying to snap myself out of it, trying to realize hidden and repeating messages in a mad attempt at personal revelation. "Oh, five red lights in a row here as well! This must mean something..." I told myself, countless times, for countless reasons. I must have ambled from place to place looking for answers for years before I began taking the note that had appeared on my arm seriously. </p>
<p>It wasn't easy to break into military facilities, of course, lucky was the few times i'd caught someone in the act of opening a door, but most had to be opened with force without any real power source. All the rocket fuel, explosives, weaponry, and technology in the world didn't matter though if there were no systems to guide it. </p>
<p>Though I still needed to eat, it didn't appear as though I was aging at all. I should have known when my Hair and beard never grew a millimeter longer, but I wasn't particularly sane for awhile either. fifty years or so into my new world, I'd realized that if I had the time, I could learn all the complex systems, calculations, and miscellaneous things to pilot some machine myself, if given long enough. But again, I could never get anything that was powered beyond the act of me moving it to work. No computers, lights, not even a spark could be turned on or produced. </p>
<p>One hundred and fifty years in, I decided to see if I could chase a philosophical answer for what I could do. Perhaps this was a test from a deity, or some cosmic joke for someone in which I was the jester? Whatever the case, from reading scripture, to the scribbling of Lunatics, i'd never found my answer.</p>
<p>On this day though, after exhausting my mind on everything, my eyes glanced down at my arm, something i'd stopped doing after the novelty of reading the message had worn off centuries ago. "However long it takes, Save us."</p>
<p>Those words wrung through my body like the most perfect mallet strike against a rubber mat for so long, but today, it was as if I was bell of the finest bronze, I knew what I was meant to do.</p>
<p>There was no way for me to actually save the world, I no longer had any doubts about that. I had known that for a long time, and in those moments of realization, I had contemplated taking my own life. I was never able to do it, no matter how much I knew there was nothing I could do except exist, but, it was this realization, that had lead me to my current one now.</p>
<p>The world around me, frozen in time, and myself, frozen in time, but not in place. I could observe our world for eternity, and so long as I am still here, it will never end. It is, and has been my duty, to live, so that this world does the same, frozen in place, without anything I can do to wake it. </p>

<p>I wake up up fully clothed in my bed, my head feels like it's filled with a mix of cotton wool and acid. 10:34 AM.After laying there for awhile I get out of bed to go make a coffee. As I wait for the kettle to boil I try to recall what happened last night, tv static, my mind is blank bar a few fleeting memories. Went to the store. Drink at home. Go out with friends. Bar. Smoke. Another bar. Smoke. And then bed, but I know thats not the full story. Kettle boiled.
I look down at my arm and see smudged sharpie pen, did I hook up last night? 
I pour my coffee and try to collect my thoughts while leaning on the counter. </p>
<p>I notice more black pen on my face, it must have came from whatever was on my arm, the one that I sleep on. I spare a moments silence for my mystery lover, whos number is now nothing more that a an illegable stain on my skin. </p>
<p>After I gathered myself I got ready to leave, the last thing I do before I leave is check my watch. 10:34 AM. I become confused, I'm sure I've been awake for atleast an hour now, did the clocks go back? Damn farmers. I brush it off as I don't have any real plans today. </p>
<p>Outside is peaceful, "another day in the countryside" I say to myself as I retrieve my bike from the shed. It's not unusual for me to see nobody between A and B. I arrive at my friends house prepared to see the rest of my hangover off in good company. I knock at the door, and weirdly enough the dogs dont bark and nobody came to the door. I figured he might be walking the dogs but find it hard to believe seen as we were both out last night. I try the door and let myself in, put the kettle on and make myself at home. I switch on the TV and get straight onto the xbox, the internet seems to be down. I play offline for awhile until it dawns on me that I've been sat here for some time now, "where the hell is he?" I think. I check the time 10:34 AM. I tap my watch, "has this thing broken already?", I brush it off and make my way upstairs to the bathroom. As I turn the corner into the bathroom, I find my friend leant over the toilet being sick. "I knocked you know? I've been sat down stairs for ages. Whats up with you?" it takes a moment for me to notice, but he isnt breathing. Infact the vomit is suspended in the air. </p>

<p>Since time has stopped, I can (using existing technology), gather enough magnifying lenses and place them between the sun and the invader... as the planet is made out of make-up, it will either melt away, or perhaps run away in embarrassment when the make-up is removed.</p>
<p>If it is really a ROGUE planet, however, I would (using existing etc,) set off a series of nuclear explosions at an angle to change the ROGUE planet's trajectory away from earth.</p>
<p>Of course, since time has STOPPED, no vehicles can move or explosions happen so I guess I would just end up reading a lot.</p>

<h4>[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.</h4>
<p>Score: 5</p>
<p>The old woman stroked my hand, 
"You will be killed by your seventh son" she murmured.</p>
<p>I laughed, pulling my hand away.</p>
<p>" I don't even have sons, only two daughters," I replied as I walked out of the fortune booth.</p>
<p>See, it was august, I was a 44 year old, slightly balding, middle executive and I had taken my family to an amusement park for a day of fun.
My wife was waiting for me outside, Sharon, her eyes as bright blue as the day i met her. She was no longer as lovely as she once was, but I loved her all the same with an affection that was  cozy and sweet.</p>
<p>"So what did she say?"</p>
<p>" Oh, stupid, mumbo jumbo, My seventh son is fated to murder me or whatnot," I explained, sarcasm evident in my voice.</p>
<p>"So morbid". She shook her head.</p>
<p>I shrugged and waved to my daughters , Maria and Elena, who were riding the gigantic ferris wheel in the center of the park.</p>
<p>"Well, the sun is setting, it's about time to be going home,"</p>
<p>After a few more fun hours, we all loaded ourselves into the back of the truck. I flexed my wrists , preparing for the long drive home. All the way home, I sang silly songs and made stupid jokes to entertain my family. Sharon, could not stop laughing and Maria let out some, "you are so silly, daddy" as I spoke. In and out we drove, though little towns and down large highways.
the horizon looked like freedom and I remembered my younger days, when i loved nothing more than to get on the open road, playing as a backup musician from different bands.
Those days I slept with many beautiful women, I went to many different places, hell I even got to meet Carlos Santana once. but nothing gave me the same joy as being a father, my wife Sharon and the kids, they steadied me.</p>
<p>We pulled up to a two story house on a cul de sac. It was in the kind of nice neighborhood parents move to went they are looking for a safe space to raise their kids. Two pink bikes in the garage,  and a perfectly spaced array of germanium surrounded our front sidewalk. </p>
<p>Maria and Elena were asleep. I walked in and open the door to my house.
The house was spooky in the darkness, eerie, floorboards creaked as I felt along the wall for a switch.</p>
<p>"Nice house you have here" a voice floated from the darkness.</p>
<p>"Who was that?" My heart started to pick up. It's thudding bum bum was all I could hear in my ears.</p>
<p>"Your son. Or at least one of them, you seem to have forgotten all about us?"</p>
<p>I stood in confusion for a moment, feeling like my world was about to crash.</p>
<p>"What sons?"</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry, I guess we didn't matter because we weren't actual sons, right, not kids that you loved.." the voice came closer. a beam of light from a flash light alit a face.</p>
<p>He was young, so young.
It was the strangest thing, with his greasy jet black hair, his piercing green eyes, the awkward shape of his nose, he reminded  me of, well me.</p>
<p>It was like seeing your doppelganger in the mirror except you never knew he'd existed.
I didn't know how to feel about him, unlike my daughters he wasn't made from some tender moment of love making, sweet words whispered on a beach during a Puerto Rican summer, he was just some furious spurts of semen in a cup. While wanking it to a picture of Jennifer Aniston, yeah, when she was hot.</p>
<p>I couldn't even truly comprehend that he was mine. </p>
<p>" Yeah, I knew you wouldn't know what to think when you saw me. I bet you've never thought of me once, but I've been thinking of you for years," the boy helped himself to a seat at my couch.
"You know," he said conversationally, " they just give sperm to anyone these days. Even some stupid bitch like my mom. She was a fucking drunk, an asshole, but she wasn't too bad, you know during the few moments she was sober she might have remembered my name. And of course, there were the numerous boyfriends. Who would use and abuse her, beat or punch her and sometimes me. But you know, a few took a great liking to me, not that bitch was around to know about it," here the boy's voice pinched with venom, he took a deep breath and continued.
"And you know every single night I used to cry for you. To help me. I used to dream that my real father would show up and hug me, tell me everything would be all right. But you were nowhere to be found."</p>
<p>He put his feet up on my table.</p>
<p>"I've been following you for weeks now. Watching you and your dumb bitch of a wife. Stupid spoiled brats you call daughters. Watching you tuck them in at night, read them stories, all these wonderful nice things, <em>Daddy</em>"</p>
<p>I heard footsteps behind me, my wife and the two little ones.</p>
<p>"Please," I pleaded, " Can we sort this out later? I promise I'll try to do something, do right by you,"</p>
<p>The boy smiled cruelly, lips curling upwards, " No, it's okay, <em>Daddy</em>, I don't want to hurt your stupid wife or daughters, just you</p>
<p>I'm going to take from you daughters every second they stole from me"</p>
<p>I barely saw the gun rise, just a dark thing at the corner of my vision </p>
<p>and it was done.</p>

<p><em>Your seventh son will kill you...</em></p>
<p>I remembered those words, despite how ridiculous they were. It was 20 years ago when I met that young seer on Io. He played the part well, you wouldn't expect good acting from a concept as goofy as a space carnival. I of course knew better, being the forefront of my industry.</p>
<p>You see, I'm a scientist. I work to create inhabitable solar systems from the dust left over from nebulas, supernovas, and the like. All it takes is the right push and a cloud of debris becomes a life-sustaining star. I was so dedicated to this business, even then, I couldn't help but laugh at the fortune-teller. I didn't have time for kids, I couldn't even date. And one-night-stands were never an issue, since we invented the male pill. Way back in my 20's I donated sperm for an experiment, which stopped me in my tracks when I realized. It was pointless to wonder that, though, since the sperm was going to an experiment, they wanted to see how long sperm survived when shot into space. Being the horny young lad I was, I assumed that I'd get to, ahem, <em>relieve myself</em> in space, but they just shot it out into space with a cannon. Lame, but they paid me for it.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? Because I am nearing my death, and the irony of it will kill you. Turns out the fortune-teller was speaking in a double-entendre. I am, or by the time you read this, <em>was</em>, 56 years old and working on my latest solar system, the biggest and most uncontrollable one, the Tarantula Nebula. I had made six livable solar systems before and this was to make or break my career. As it would turn out, a bit of carbon cells found their way into the beam that would make a sun from ashes of Tarantula. Those are some fickle beams, and I should have scanned the area before I fired. Now I can't prove it, since who knows how many people have jacked off in space by now, but I like to think that it was my sperm from all those years ago, come to fulfill the prophecy in the most ironic way possible.</p>

<p>Score: 5</p>
<p>The reporter asked me to explain how I won last year's championship. I proceeded to burst into laughter and I couldn't stop no matter how hard I tried. It really was funny what I did to that vile man.</p>
<p>Once I gathered myself and the laughter slowly escaped me, I cleared my throat and proceeded to explain to her what I did to the most evil man in history.</p>
<p>I kidnapped him. This wasn't reported because Nazi propaganda wouldn't allow the world to know their leader had gone missing. This would've insured the Germans lost the war and the Third Reich no more. But rest assured, I kidnapped the man.</p>
<p>I dressed him up in raggedy clothes and tied a Star of David around his bicep. Then I pushed him into the crowd of SS soldiers and watched as he was immediately arrested for being 'Jewish'. He screamed and screamed, telling the officers as they carried him away that he was their Fuhrer. They, of course, didn't believe him, and considered a Jew comparing himself to the Fuhrer as a treason.</p>
<p>I laughed in front of the reporter again. I told her they took the Fuhrer away to the camps and lined him up with the rest of the enemies of the state. One by one, they were chosen. Some were taken to the labor camps, the others to gas chambers. Guess which one the Fuhrer was taken to?</p>
<p>The most hated man in history was gassed alive by his own men along with other enemies of the state. I probably shouldn't be laughing because millions of innocents died along with him, but you have to admit, the irony is pretty hysterical.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, the German propaganda announced that the most hated man in history had killed himself, probably to save themselves the embarrassment of misplacing their Fuhrer. I don't know if the Nazis ever found out they were responsible for the Fuhrer's death but this is how it went down last year. This is why I won last year. I, of course, expect to win this year, I told the reporter. I have something better and more cruel planned for the most hated man in history this year.</p>

<p>It took a lot of precision to teleport the bullet that almost killed Hitler, to his first large public speaking event, at an angle which would merely sever his penis.  It's true that he didn't physically die that day, but the committee agreed his fate was worse than death.  Having been publicly humiliated pubicly, even he agreed and took his own life.
  Next year, I'm hoping that putting him in a gas chamber full of his angry prisoners  will get me the W.</p>

<p>It all started on a tuesday. I knew I couldn't face the awards presentation, that dark ballroom in anonymity again. None of the others knew my name, they had no reason to. why should they? The fact that the awards banquet was later that evening fazed me little. A time travel contest, after all procrastination seems to have lost its meaning these days. 8 hours is still too long, at least there's a liquor store opening soon. i wonder what whiskey will be like in two hundred years.  Killing Hitler starts not some hundred odd years in the past, but two into the future. The fact that i've watched the greatest film in history 500 times or more, and rehearsed this twice that number, I feel certain i'll be able to execute drunken master moves like Darth Binks, of retrofuturistic fame. Stealing history's most gruesome and fast acting neurotoxin will be a cinch. That's why the whiskey comes first. Scant minutes later, a significant portion of stolen "future" whiskey and sandwich later, I was ready. I knew the route, i knew the way the guards would act, it was no real trick to relieve them of their horrible cargo and begone back to my space, my time. The same hotel we meet at ever year, I'm close enough to hear the nervous twittering, and I know that i've timed things well enough, the next part frightens and excites me. The lump in my vest pocket seems alive, i can feel my heart beating, and for a panicked moment i'm convinced that the beating is so intense that it will break the phial prematurely, and thwart my plans. This doesn't happen of course, the hyperbole of adrenaline always pushes reason aside for silly thoughts like this to flower. By this time i've quietly entered the meeting hall and sat down at my assigned table, conveniently/unimportantly near the back door. The MC (who year after year insists upon calling himself Max Quordlepleen), clears his throat "and now ladies and gentlemen the moment you've all been waiting for . . . this year's winner of the 'prime directive be damned let's kill Hitler' award (at this moment he held aloft the gold and jewel accented/crusted single pv shrimp boot) and without further ado, the winner of this year's award and a lifetime supply of vibranium is . . . "</p>
<p>I pushed a button in my side pocket and immediately i was not sitting at my table, rather in a bathroom stall with none other than the failed austrian painter in question. I knew from repeated observation when the precise moment would be to pop in, after he'd finished his affairs and cleaned himself, but not before standing and pulling his trousers up. in one fluid movement i pulled out the syringe, coupled it with the phial transferring the liquid, jabbed Hister in the neck and hit the retrieval button on my travel device. I had set things to have us  appear not at my table, but rather right behind good ole Max. By the time the crowd had alerted the MC to our presence the one balled wonder had already begun his fatal transformation. By the time the crowd had come to its feet in outrage the transformation was complete, the pile of  caviar the size of an ex dictator put off an appetizing smell, for those of a refined palate. I pulled from my briefcase a handful of mother of pearl spoons and I led by example. </p>
<p>Max puts his finger to his ear in histrionic fashion, "hold on now, the judges wish to confer, smoke 'em if you got 'em . . . or if you're hungry . . . by all means..."</p>

<p>Johnny was a simple man, albeit slightly overweight.  When time froze and the writing appeared on his arm he wondered around the world for what seemed like millions of years, yet he didn't have a clue how to save the earth.  </p>
<p>However, millions of years gave johnny time to think. Since time was frozen he could simply jump in place until he generated enough force to move the Earth out of the way of the rouge planet.  </p>
<p>He'd never been great at math, but since Johnny had a while to think he came to the following conclusions.</p>
<ul>
<li>He weighed roughly 300 pounds last time he checked.</li>
<li>He was able to get roughly 1 second of air time when he jumped. </li>
<li>9.8 m/s acceleration on the way down. Meaning he'd hit the ground with 2940 pounds of force </li>
<li>The earth weighed 1.317 × 10^25 pounds.</li>
<li>This meant that that he'd need to jump 4.47 × 10^21 times in one spot to be able move the earth just a little bit in one direction. </li>
<li>It took him roughly 2 seconds to jump up and down one time.</li>
<li>Knowing this he'd have to jump in one place for roughly 2.84 × 10^14 years to be able to move the earth slightly. Longer then the Universe has been around for.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a sigh, Johnny started jumping. He may as well get started.</p>

<p>So many signals flashing at once....</p>
<p>I bounced from one button to the other, pressing each one back in to acknowledge, making a mental note as I went.  So many systems flaking out at the same time, it was terrible. </p>

<p>This was unprecedented - surely something had gone wrong with the equipment?  Was it something I had done wrong, something I'd not planned for.  Had I got the sequence wrong?</p>

<p>Selfish bastards. Have you any idea the anger that will manifest when you are left to stew on how someone royally <em>fucked</em> you so many God damned years ago, without ever being able to do a thing about it?! Not even a single living person to even <em>complain</em> to? I'm sat here for the countless-th fucking time scribbling on a God damned piece of scrap paper, just for the slightest bit of release!</p>
<p>I didn't choose for this to happen. I wasn't anything fucking special and I'd never set myself up for <em>anything</em>. I was just an ordinary fucking person. I dropped out of school early for fuck's sake! Why me?! Why was <em>I</em> the one that those cowards chose to do the impossible? <em>It's an entire. Fucking. Planet!</em> What did they expect me to do?!</p>
<p>I have tried. And tried. I can't even say for how long. When time no longer <em>exists</em>, it's a bit difficult to keep track of it. I've gone through it all in my head. Maybe there were some clues that I should have followed. Maybe I knew <em>something</em> that others didn't. Maybe I have some sort of contact with God and I just have to find the <em>God damned</em> telephone line to his office! </p>
<p>I've gone through entire fucking libraries of texts. I've prayed in every single God damned church, chapel or registry office I've come across! I even learned a bit of Arabic and tried to deciefer versions of the Qu'ran, and that turned out about as useful as the Torah. I'm at my witt's end. And it just can't end. </p>
<p>And every single day, I'm teased by that big, black circle in the sky. It has sat in that exact same position beside the Sun, in between the same damned clouds, for what must have been decades. I just want it to turn to night and I just want to be let to die with everyone else. But I can't. Something out there, some selfish, cowardly mind out there, decided that <em>I</em> was to be the one stuck in this limbo, while everyone else just stood suspended in time. None the wiser. I'd take the fear that they were frozen with over this, no questions asked.</p>
<p>I have to find it some day. I really don't know how. But there really would have been no reason to even try and keep me here without there being <em>some</em> solution. The sun is finally getting lower in the sky as I travel southward to escape it. Maybe then, once I've reached the night, I can at least get some sleep.</p>

<p>"Save us", they said. And I whispered "no". It had been 200 years since that day. Somehow, my computer was still working. And so was the internet. You never really realize just how many memes are out there. So far, I have read every single thread on reddit. I went to 4chan, although it only shows threads made in the last few days. To get all of the greentext stories, you have to go to obscure places. The amount of reposts I have gone through is enough to traumatize even the most dedicated meme-enthusiasts. During this time stop, I am unable to age, or get sick. If that was not the case, all the chemotherapy in the world wouldn't save me from the terminal cancer I would have developed wading through the filth of 9gag in a last desperate attempt at original content. Just when I thought I couldn't take it anymore, I found the solution to all of my problems. I was searching my local files when I saw a program that had been installed centuries ago, without my noticing. Meme-maker 2003. Never again would I be without fresh OC. I have ascended from my mere mortal form. I have become a Meme-master.</p>

<p><em>I stand now upon the mountain. Perhaps I am a prophet, arms outstretched to eternity, to speak of our futility that others may learn. Perhaps I have already passed, and this is the afterlife with which all men – all beings – are faced. Regardless, I conclude this annal, the record of countless lives lived through the eyes of those who called this Earth home.</em></p>
<p>I stood wearily, brushing absentmindedly the dust from my hands as I replaced the chisel and mallet in my backpack. When I began this project I used better tools, but I ran out of power relatively quickly. That is to say, Im not so sure how long it's been.</p>
<p>Back when I first figured it out, what the inscription meant, I set about trying to learn. I never did finish high school, so I drove down to the nearest university and tried to read up on what I missed. Problem is, it doesn't much matter how much time you have when you don't know what do do with it. So after what I figure was a few years, I gave up on the physics – never made much sense to me. Soon after all the science went. I tried dying a few times, no dice there. So I went back to the reading. </p>
<p>I found myself drawn to our history. I wasn't looking for answers anymore, I just wanted to know for my own sake. A few decades must have passed, and I went through most of the libraries I could drive to – taking a new car every time the last one ran out of gas. Folks don't seem to mind much if you take their truck when they're frozen in time. </p>
<p>I didn't keep a tally, but it must've been after 50 years that it dawned on me. There was no way to save yourself for very long once time starts rolling. I'd read about a thousand empires that came and went, didn't make much of a difference how much they knew. The only thing that lasted was their story. The only way to save them was to remember. </p>
<p>So I wrote. I had a flair for the dramatic, I guess. I chiselled our story, the history of Earth as far as we knew it in the year 2020, into the mountains. On the Earth itself, I etched our lives. Now, as I hold the hammer to strike in place the last full stop, I hesitate. Perhaps I have not saved us, but I have kept us alive in the only way that matters. I did whatever I could, for as long as it took. </p>
<p>I set the chisel. 
I raise my hammer. 
I strike...</p>

<p>We'd survived the lipstick comet. We'd survived the mascara nova from Glamdromeda. </p>

<p>We tried shooting entire silos of nail polish remover at it. West Hollywood sent their best and brightest in for a thinktank with NASA, and that was the best they could do. </p>
<p>While time stands still, South Korea is busy blanketing the earth with its questionably effective fruit-based facial cleansing masks. Can it protect us from the rouged one? Physics and all science says no.</p>
<p>Sephora says yes. </p>

<h4>[WP]: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.</h4>
<p>Score: 4</p>
<p>My mother once told me self abuse would make me go blind, but as an adult making minimum wage at a coffee shop, it was a risk I was willing to take and a way to stop me from having children of my own. I was never worried about blindness anyway, it was the least of my worries.</p>
<p>I knew hidden in the family history was an illness that had no boundries. As my son stood over me I wondered how I had produced a viable product.  How was it that their screening didn't show some sign of my curse 7th of the seventh.  </p>
<p>My owned a farm, one of the last family owned in town. He poured himself into his work just to barely break even.  He tried everything to keep us afloat, he even tried to sell his soul. the towns people laughed at his craiglist post, "My soul for my farm and family's well being." All but one.  </p>
<p>A person with - what seemed like limitless funds - wanted our farm to flourish, no soul required and all she wanted in return was our sacrifice.  Our 7th's.</p>
<p>We never believed her, even what I was born. The 9th son.  But that was until mom ran off with the other man and the cause of my two siblings red hair and freckles was brought to light.  That was the day... that horrible day when the curse became real for me.  Took over me and I realized I believed in curses. I had to.  My father was to blame for the accident, no one knew that truth outside the family.  I couldn't be blamed for the horrible accident with the tractor, I knew it was the curse that made me murder him.</p>
<p>My father died in my arms and now the man standing over me was about to do the same.  The curse fills you with lust, you can't avoid the 7th. I thought I had figured a work around. I didn't have any children of my own. Instead I fought the lust the only way I knew how. I had stayed away from women off the printed page and yet here I was.  I became homeless just to ensure no woman would have me.  Curses don't come with fine print, I wish I thought of a better loophole.</p>
<p>Another vehicle accident to wreak havoc with the Johnson family, another moment between father and son that left me unrelentingly hopeless.  My son had become a man, one I never knew or planned to.  He was driving his car when the curse took hold and didn't let go until what was called for happened. </p>
<p>With me it would be quick, I felt no pain below my wait, just adrenaline and blood flowing through me, out of me.</p>
<p>The man came to me and I had to ask "Was your mother artificially inseminated?"  Aghast, he didn't answer, my guess is he thought I was in shock, dying. But I pressed on "Do you live near the clinic on Broadway and Chelsea stress, please I have to know?"  A pause, he studied my bloody face, beneath the dirt and grime I had purposefully accumulated he saw familiarity and family.  He saw me for who I was for a brief second and whispered "dad?"</p>
<p>I caught him in his silent thoughts of "could it be" and told him of the curse, what I had tried to do to stave off the hairy hand of fate. My time was ending fast, My words poured out too slowly. He didn't understand. Time was running out.  He saw only the crazed homeless person, not the man I was only the shell of a human I was.  As he ran I yelled after him "Don't have seven children, you're cursed, you're cursed!" </p>
