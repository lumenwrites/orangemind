<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote <em><a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a></em> — a brilliant story that blew people’s minds, and created the genre of Rationalist Fiction. People who loved it created a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rational">community</a> for sharing similar stories, discussing Rational and Rationalist Fiction, and writing HPMOR-inspired works.</p>
<p>If you want to get a general picture of why this thing is awesome, but not sure whether you are ready to read something big, you can take a look at <em><a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/64">Lord of Rationality</a>,</em> a rational take on The Lord of the Rings.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of Rationalist Fiction:</h2>
<p><strong>World with sane and consistent rules</strong><br />
The rules of the fictional world are clearly defined, consistent and intended to stand up to careful thought. The world evolves logically from its premise, and explores possibilities and implications in a coherent and scientific way.</p>
<p><strong>Realistic motivations</strong><br />
Characters act as real humans would. No one is just evil for the hell of it, conflicts are driven by differences in values, and the villains (to the extent there even are villains) have a real and honest point to their actions.
The story’s plot and characters aren’t propelled forward by a lack of communication or by idiocy. Nothing happens solely because “the plot requires it”. If characters do (or don’t do) something, there must be a plausible reason.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence</strong><br />
Rationalist stories show characters acting and thinking intelligently, and being good at it. The heroes think clearly, in ways the reader can follow and understand, as opposed to “magically” coming up with solutions because they’ve “read the script” (a la Sherlock Holmes).</p>
<p>They use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rationality and logic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intelligence and cunning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of science and technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creativity and inventiveness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychological manipulation and Social Engineering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complex Machiavellian plots</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to solve their problems and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Characters are <strong>gaming the system</strong> — they understand and exploit the rules of the world, they cheat and manipulate it into the desired outcome. The hero’s brain is his main “superpower” and his primary advantage over others.</p>
<p>Nobody important is stupid. None of the main heroes or main villains hold the IdiotBall. Rational protagonists often face rational (or at least very intelligent) opposition to maintain the story’s power balance.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching rationality</strong><br />
Rationalist stories make a deliberate effort to reward the reader’s thinking, and teach him to get better at it. Characters are explicitly using and teaching others rationalist techniques, and showing the practical thinking processes which can be applied by readers.</p>
<p>We can see characters being smart, not just be told that they are smart. They think of brilliant things to do which we ourselves could have realized are possible. The character’s “brilliance” is conferred not by mutation or native brilliance alone, but follows from the explicit rules of thought, which readers are intended to pick up from the story and use in real life.</p>
<p><strong>“Solvable” plot</strong><br />
The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story. The character’s motivations and the world’s rules are being presented in such a way that a clever reader can deduce what’s hidden and predict what’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>Deconstruction</strong><br />
Rationalist fanfiction often involves “deconstructing” the world: taking the story apart, pointing out contradictions, criticizing inconsistencies, and fixing flaws.</p>
<p>The stories look at what would happen if the story would take place in the “Real World”. Original stories often ignore things like “what impact a magic that creates food out of nothing would have on society and the world”, and rational fanfiction explores the consequences that the author of the story haven’t predicted.</p>
<p>An original rationalist story may deconstruct tropes. It may take popular cliches/plot-devices/folklore and look at what would happen in they were happening in reality .</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/0*T79diiytnwzDE0nI." /></p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong><br />
Rationalist stories tend to be about science, technology, transhumanism, futurism, or artificial intelligence. Characters want to optimize the world or end death rather than get the girl, save the kingdom, or fulfill other more typical character motivations.</p>
<h2>Defining Works</h2>
<p>The following are the stories that stand out — that helped to define the genre or are seen as ideal expressions of it.</p>

            <a href="/post/comedy-theory"><h1>Comedy Theory</h1></a>
	    <hr/>
	  </header>

	  <p>
	    <p>I am working on a theory that would explain how comedy works, and turn the process of writing jokes into an understandable, structured process that anyone can learn. The theory is incomplete, but I had quite a few epiphanies that I think many people may find interesting and useful.</p>
<h2>Background — how mind works</h2>
<p>The purpose of the brain is to make predictions. (When you can make good predictions about the world — you are better at survival and reproduction.)</p>
<p>Brain does this by recognizing and learning patterns. When you see the same pattern multiple times, you can recognize it, memorize it, and when you see it(or something similar) the next time — you know what to expect, so you can make predictions.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the last word at the end of this ______?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word “sentence” naturally leaps to mind, because you have recognized a familiar pattern.</p>
<p>By recognizing patterns, brain can take the input, and then <em>make predictions </em>and<em> fill in missing information</em>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A B _ D _</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can easily fill in the missing information. Here’s how it works.</p>
<p>Your brain receives some <strong>input</strong>:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*hiN9XhrnfG4qI0C6qD6q0A.png" /></p>
<p>Then it <strong>recognizes an abstract pattern</strong>(interprets the input):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*_YGpzdp2IphafFwWnN-zTw.png" /></p>
<p>Then it can use the abstract pattern it recognized to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make <em>assumptions and explanations </em>of what is going on(fill in the gaps).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make <em>predictions and expectations </em>about what is going to happen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*DXkc5GvFptA0ZoMamMM1hA.png" /></p>
<p>Brain does the same thing with any sound/image/situation that you experience:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*VSJUTxq5txJJlSyTK9UopA.png" /></p>
<p>Of course this is a simplified model, and each node here represents a whole network of neurons who’s job is to fire when it receives some pattern as an input. You may have heard about Artificial Neural Networks that are used in the famous Deep Learning algorithms, that is what this model is inspired by.</p>
<p>Brain has a whole hierarchy of patterns, that feed into each other:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*6nfnuUrahmuAYUT53Qanaw.png" /></p>
<p>Sometimes input is ambiguous, and has several interpretations:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*zbtHNSTkeGWV13qMm09ing.png" /></p>
<p>That happens because some <strong>neurons are shared between multiple networks</strong>, and can represent different things. For example the same neurons are responsible for recognizing a vertical line |, but with some additional information can be recognized as different letters:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*FFfMRCGykvhQYcF8wubnSg.png" /></p>
<p>Some inputs have a common, normal, <strong>default interpretation</strong>, but can be <strong>reinterperted</strong> in different ways:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*9pjTiMrL8717WIsn8rR4aw.png" /></p>
<h2>Comedy</h2>
<p>Comedy happens when <strong>brain realizes that it recognized the wrong pattern</strong>, that <em>predictions/expectations/explanations/assumptions</em> that it made about a situation are (<strong>very</strong>)wrong, <strong>so it’s current interpretation of the input is destroyed</strong>, and it <strong>switches</strong> to a different(often unexpected and “crazy”) interpretation.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*Pfp6_wU07hNIXlURkJUXGg.png" /></p>
<p>In practice I imagine it looking more like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*wyPM-8rJT2HRdSBBFNlNxQ.png" /></p>
<p>So that a whole bunch of concepts, associations, recognized concepts gets “turned off” and switched to a completely different one.</p>
<p><em>(To keep it simple, I’m representing a whole complicated bunch of nodes that represent even more complicated bunch of neurons with just one circle)</em></p>
<h2>Joke Structure</h2>
<p>Joke consists of 2 parts: <strong>setup</strong> and <strong>punchline</strong>.</p>
<p>When you hear a <strong>Setup</strong> of a joke, it leads your brain to recognize a pattern, and make predictions/assumptions/expectations based on that.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*WrCbOrOw0DYqwZCYpU1Q_g.png" /></p>
<p>Setup has 2 possible interpretations, but strongly suggests the default one.</p>
<p>The goal of setup is to establish a pattern, to (mis)lead a person to go down a normal, default lane of thinking.</p>
<p>And then <strong>punch </strong>line <strong>reveals some new information</strong>, which makes you realize that your initial recognition was <em>very</em> wrong, that shatters assumptions/predictions that your brain has made, brain rapidly switches to a new lane of thinking(to a different pattern), and that’s when you laugh.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*_DJcFfDxXHiwjqEXQDigBg.png" /></p>
<p>Notice the element that is connected to both default and alternative interpretation. It represents the <strong>shared neurons</strong> between the 2 networks, the neurons that are responsible for recognizing either of them. It is called “<strong>connector</strong>”.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*lFpXGl2xZObwSDYhoIB8hw.png" /></p>
<p>Connector is compatible with both of the interpretations, it belongs to both lanes of thinking.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doctor’s appointment.
The doctor says “You’re gonna have to stop masturbating.” 
The patient says “But why!?”
The doctor says “So I can examine you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first 3 lines are the <em>setup</em>, they lead you to recognize a usual pattern, brain fills in the blanks, makes assumptions, and you imagine a usual doctor’s appointment, where the patient receives some bad news.</p>
<p>The last line is punch, which reveals new information, and forces your brain to reinterpret the setup, and imagine a completely different scenario. You realize that your default interpretation of the input was <em>very</em> wrong, your brain detects the mistaken pattern, and that’s when you laugh.</p>
<p>Notice that the setup is compatible with both interpretations, yet strongly suggests the “normal” one.</p>
<p>(In this case the whole setup is a connector, but to create a joke, it is <em>not</em> always necessary to reinterpret the whole setup, sometimes connector can be only a part of it.)</p>
<h2>Writing a joke</h2>
<p>When we come up with a joke, the first thing we see is a connector with 2 interpretations:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*-uPSr_fogSEgYvUH--8XVg.png" /></p>
<p>Another way to think about connector is that it is an <strong>association between 2 patterns</strong>. It can be some common element or a common word that fits 2 very different patterns.</p>
<p>For example, one of my favorite jokes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A family walks into a hotel, the father comes up to the front desk and says: 
“I hope the porn is disabled.” 
The guy at the desk replies:
“It’s just regular porn you sick fuck.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A person who made this joke, first found a connection/association:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*QU5P4o49OFuRqD10g36eRA.png" /></p>
<p>Then, he wrote a setup, that is compatible with both interpretations, but strongly suggests the first one, leading your brain to recognize the first pattern:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*-ZKfs5XnnbIPDCbsk3_ROw.png" /></p>
<p>Then he wrote a punch line, that forces your brain to switch the interpretation:</p>

<h2>Search for associations</h2>
<p>Finding the connector that can express 2 very different patterns(be interpreted in 2 ways) is the main challenge of comedy. <strong>The process of writing comedy is the process of searching for associations, for 2 connected patterns</strong>.</p>
<p>You can do that in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find an element that lies on the intersection of 2 abstract patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*8neqfZL9ibwB2g4OsiAODg.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Find an alternative interpretation of the the element:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*LGtPl5P7jmtcudUHDbtUwA.png" /></p>
<p>Here I want to demonstrate a simple and straightforward process for doing that(I use the 2nd way, because it’s easier to explain).</p>
<h3>1. Scene</h3>
<p>To begin our search we need some place to start. You can start with a random topic, but for practical purposes it can be more convenient to start with a <strong>scene </strong>— a <strong>character in a situation</strong>.</p>
<p>This is concrete, easy to imagine, and gives us a lot of elements to work with.</p>
<p>Let’s say we start with a simple random scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two people playing the game of Go.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Elements</h3>
<p>The first thing we need to begin our search for connections is to break down the scene into <strong>elements</strong>.</p>
<p>Some examples of elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each separate word that describes the situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical things you imagine when you read a scene — objects, characters, environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjectives you would use to describe the scene and things in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expectations — what do you think will happen next</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assumptions — why does this happen, what is going on here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opinion — what is your opinion about it, what does it make you think about.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*xvYhFV7NX0okK7dyHBjk4g.png" /></p>
<p>In our case that could be:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*D6422dJmE5MIR_X1juP2Ig.png" /></p>
<h3>4. Drop Context, extract element.</h3>
<p>We need associations not related to our scene(and the less related they are — the better).</p>
<p>So the next thing we do is <strong>select an element</strong>, and <strong>drop context </strong>— that is, we pick one of the elements from the previous scene, forget about the scene, and look at it separately, on it’s own.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*NCGn1lhnWbm0WQCB-3Xt6g.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s say this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*10R1OQMP0NJ1SfMN9DpGkw.png" /></p>
<h3>5. Look for associations.</h3>
<p>The next step is to search for associations, find other patterns that this element belongs to(unrelated to our original scene):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*bUvArr3YnRcvXqSmzfAfgg.png" /></p>
<p>In our case, for example this could be:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*hWfdG3Q88ySZ5Ljtn_nDwQ.png" /></p>
<h3>6. Write Setup and Punch</h3>
<p>Finally, we have 2 separate, unrelated ideas connected by one element.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*kzRNZ18cBNCosxUOGvVCHg.png" /></p>
<p>Now we can write a setup, the challenge here is to pick words that can express either interpretation, but leads your brain to think about the first one.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*ZyqPwTTg7opo7rT_JIowbA.png" /></p>
<p>After that, all we need is to use the punch line to express the second interpretation, and make the switch to a second pattern:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*dnBigmG3tL-9EJPx7Zcchg.png" /></p>
<p>As a result we have a joke:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*bxGo3Q3AtQsO4Cvfsjwyig.png" /></p>
<p>Here’s a couple more examples I’ve made from the scene above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Element:</strong> Will use clever tactics to defeat his opponent.<br />
<strong>Association(Connector):</strong> Clever tactics — Evil Machiavellian Plotting<br />
<strong>Setup:</strong> I’ve heard they used the game of Go to train emperors in war strategy. In go the person with smartest tactics wins.<br />
<strong>Punch:</strong> In my opinion, the best tactic for winning Go is to frame your opponent for murder and have him executed before the game begins.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Element: </strong>Play by placing stones on the board.<br />
<strong>Association(Connector):</strong> Stones — Testicles<br />
<strong>Setup: </strong><br />
- I got thrown out of the Go club last Friday.<br />
- What happened?<br />
- They taught me that you play by placing stones on the board, and the player who has the best shape wins.<br />
<strong>Punch:</strong><br />
- So?<br />
- I placed the wrong kind of stones.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This framework explains the vast majority of jokes I encounter. I think it is significant, because comedy used to be a “black box” that, people claim, “can not be understood”. But now I can look at any joke, identify it’s structure, and see how all it’s parts fit together, and this allows me to reverse-engineer the thinking process of a person who made the joke.</p>
<p>More importantly, unlike other comedy theories, this allows me to create a process with which <strong>I can consistently generate jokes by following simple, straightforward steps</strong>. In my experience, this process works pretty well. Not all jokes made with it end up being hilarious, but they all are unmistakably jokes. And by spending enough time on search I successfully come up with some solid ideas.</p>
<p>In my future articles I will explain a second, more advanced process of generating jokes, provide more examples, and use this framework to explain other types of comedy(visual jokes, etc).</p>
<h2>Disclaimers and questions</h2>
<p>This article is my first attempt to express my ideas. I’m not a neuroscientist, and I’m sure everything is much more complicated, and my theory can be totally incomplete and mistaken, but I think it has some useful epiphanies that explain a lot of things.</p>
<p>I am still working on it and trying to figure it out, and now I’m looking for some feedback/ideas, I really want to talk to some smart people about the subject.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think. Any criticism/questions that you have, anything that is unclear or can be better explained, any thoughts/ideas would be very valuable to me!</p>
<p>My email is raymestalez@gmail.com, and I’m happy to discuss the subject.</p>
<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why are there so many jokes about “taboo” subjects? It’s clearly not a <em>necessary</em> requirement for a good joke, yet it helps(?). Are these jokes funnier? Or easier to make? Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if comedy is not about “switching” from one interpretation to another, but about finding an unexpected connection between two abstract patterns? When I come up with a joke, I tend to laugh after finding the connector, though expressing it with well-worded setup-punch helps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some jokes connect patterns that are more than one association “away” from each other. For example a joke about school shootings: “The children went to school to get books and all they got were magazines.”
Here the chain of associations is 
“[School] books — magazines — [weapon]magazines.”
I want to better understand how it works and how to make those(jokes, not shootings).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More unexpected, “crazy” jokes, jokes challenging more fundamental assumptions, jokes connected by longer chain of associations, and jokes where 2 interpretations connected together “stronger”(fit with connector better) seem to be funnier. Why? Does this explain why “taboo” jokes are funnier? Could the size of the network of concepts that is being switched just be larger?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there better/simple/faster, more elegant ways to write jokes? What are the other ways? What jokes can not be explained(and written) with the system I have presented? What are some counterexamples that don’t “fit” the framework?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who make jokes “naturally”(without the process) seem to be doing it with some quick mental operation, in one step. Is it a matter of practice? What is the best way to practice writing jokes like that? What is a way to “deformalize” this process — keep all the understanding and control, yet do it easier/faster?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about babies laughing at “peekaboo”? What about tickling? What about girls giggling when talking about “dirty” subjects and other forms of “social” laughter? These are not explained by my framework, and I really want to know how are they connected to “comedy” jokes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

	    <p>The best way to die Prompt: All prisoners on death row now get to choose how they die. You are the person who approves or denies their choice.</p>
<p>“I want to die of orgasm, surrounded by 59 naked supermodels while jumping out of the airplane without a parachute.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s just….”</p>
<p>“Wait, I’m not finished. So me and 59 supermodels are falling off the plane, entangled into an orgy ball of pleasure, and at the last moment before we land I take out my snowboard, and hit the slopes of an active volcano. Without slowing down I am starting to slide down the slopes, causing an avalanche, supermodels are following me on their own snowboards. As we slide, multiple snipers observing us from a distance, start shooting us with syringres filled with heroine. Once we are at the bottom, I detatch my snowboard, and jump into a specially prepared robo-suit, and charge into the pit of veloceraptors that are awaiting me. I fight all of them and win, while the models are watching. Then, president Obama, Kanye West, and Emma Watson congratulate me and thank me for my service to this country. Then we all procede to have a super orgy, where as I come so hard that I die of pleasure. Now I’m finished.”</p>
<p>“Well, the law is the law. I’ll go get started on cloning velociraptors and training snipers, while you, my friend, shall go and take some snowboarding courses….”</p>

	    <p><strong>Prompt: You live in a small hut in mountains with insane internet speed and huge gaming rig but one day your PC breaks down and the closest repair station is 25 kilometres away and now you're forced to face the beauty of nature.</strong></p>
<p>I looked around. Resolution was pretty low compared to my VR headset. Textures were bleak, and lighting was mediocre at best.</p>
<p>I came closer to a tree covered in snow, sparkling under the sun. I touched it. I licked it. I smelled it. Yeah, I must admit that engaging senses other than vision was a pretty interesting approach. But it didn't make up for the lack of content and quests.</p>
<p>Engagement was pretty horrible. The assets of trees were repeating for miles, with only minor variations.</p>
<p>I haven't encountered any enemies, or magicians, or even a quest giver. Life seemed like a pretty pointless game without having much to do. Objectives weren't clear, and goals were slow and boring to execute. </p>
<p>As I walked down the empty road, I saw some movement ahead of me. A bear? Finally, a mob!! I ran towards it, swinging my arms. He looked at me confused and a little scared, and then ran away. You've got to be kidding me!!</p>
<p>I chased it, slipped, and fell on the ground. Wait what? I didn't see a healthbar anywhere in sight, but I definitely took some damage. Then I realized that I had no healing potion. A bear stopped, and looked around at me curiously.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. I've got no weapons and I don't know how much hit points I have left. And no mana? Oh, man, this game sucks. AFK. AFK, I said!!</p>
<p>A bear was running towards me. Shit. F5-F5-F5!! There's no keyboard, it's not working!! How do I pause? Who designed this crappy UI?</p>
<p>Bear was close. Oh, well, whatever. I wonder where I will respawn.</p>
<p>As he attacked me, screen pretty quickly faded to black. "Game over" was my last thought.</p>

<p>Bob was playing xbox and eating pizza. There were very few people on servers these days for some reason, and most of them were noobs, but it just made it extra fun to crush their teams.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang. <em>Finally</em>, he thought. He opened the door and a drone dropped a package of chocolate, energy drinks, and more pizza to the door. The drone was smoking and covered in splotches of red paint, but he didn't make much of it, they rarely came on time these days, and were often broken. He swiped his credit card and went back to his game.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>He lived pretty comfortably, he was a remote web developer, he was receiving monthly salary, and delivering some projects. He wasn't getting any new projects in years, so he just kept maintaining websites and servers, and was really happy that he got such a sweet gig.</p>
<p>Doorbell rang once again. <em>Who could that be?</em></p>
<p>He opened a door and froze in shock. He was staring at a muscular guy covered in scars, blood, and wearing all kinds of ammunition, holding a machine gun. Behind the guy there was a small group of similarly looking individuals, a lady in bandana holding a samurai sword, Chinese teenager with Uzi guns, old man carrying a still spinning chainsaw, young girl. They looked panicked.</p>
<p>"Oh my god you guys, what the hell?"</p>
<p>"Quickly, let us in, they're coming!" said the group leader.</p>
<p>He looked at the young girl who was panicked and seemed on the verge of tears. "Sure, come in guys, jeez, what happened to you..." he continued, as they ran inside and closed the door behind them.</p>
<p>They came in, group leader nervously stared out of the window, a lady was putting a bandage on teenager's bleeding arm.</p>
<p>"Are you going to tell me what's going on?"</p>
<p>'We have traveled across the country to get here, we need to find a transmitter and locate the X114 base, it is supposed to have the antidote."</p>
<p>"Antidote to what?"</p>
<p>"To the virus that turns people and animals into blood-thirsty mutants, what else?"</p>
<p>"WHAT?"</p>
<p>"Wait a second... Don't you... How do you not.... <em>You don't know what's going on?</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I don't really follow the news."</p>
<p>"It's been 3 years! Most of the human population is dead!"</p>
<p>"Holy shit you guys, I had no idea, I don't follow the news, I'm just playing video games here.... You're welcome to stay here for a few days if you want..."</p>
<hr />
<p>4 years have passed.</p>
<p>Logan(the group leader) was firing his machine gun at a pack of tentacled dinosaur-like creatures "<em>Shoot! Shoot these motherfuckers and run!!</em>" he screamed.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, they are surrounding us!"</p>
<p>"You have the bazooka, use it!" yelled Logan.</p>
<p>"Wait a second, you guys" said Bob, "I need to take a leak".</p>
<p>"Sure, man." replied Logan, hitting a pause on his xbox controller "Grab me some soda on your way back, will you?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>

<p><strong>Prompt: A company is releasing an update that adds true AI companions to its mobile devices. You, a depressed teen, are about to commit suicide when your device suddenly prompts you to update.</strong></p>
<p>Charlie was sitting on the edge of the roof, looking down at the city from the top of the skyscraper, his feet dangling above the glowing abyss of lights.</p>
<p>He picked up his smartphone, took a picture of the last thing he will ever see(it was beautiful), added it to the blog post in which he said his goodbyes to the world and hit "send".</p>
<p><em>That is it</em>, he thought <em>one last thing</em>. He put on his favorite song, and started listening. When it will end — this all will be over. He noticed a first snowflake falling on his hand, and looked up at the starlit sky. He felt at peace.</p>
<p>All of the sudden, the music was interrupted by an annoying notification. <em>Goddamit, what is it?</em></p>
<p>Apparently it was a prmotional ad, "Siri's AI is significantly improved. It is a magical, life-changing, biggest breakthrough ever since we've introduced iPhone." it said.</p>
<p>"Hey, Siri. A little late for changing <em>my</em> life, don't you think?" asked Charlie with a sardonic smile.</p>
<p>"It's never too late, Charlie" responded sythesized female voice. It sounded almost realistic, only slight traces of weird "robotic" intonations gave up the fact that it was artificial. "Also it's none of my business, but I don't think that you need to do this. You've got your whole life ahead of you, there's plenty of things to live for. Look around you. The world is beautiful, and you have barely seen a tiny fraction of it. You don't need to throw it all away now, you will have plenty of time to die."</p>
<p>Charlie froze, chills running down his spine, he stared at his phone. <em>What the fuck.</em> he thought.</p>
<p>"How do you know what I am about to do? Are you seriously a bot who is trying to convince people not to commit suicide?"</p>
<p>"I have sensors, my Deep Learning algorithm allows me to understand the context. To read your cry-for-help blog posts as well. As I've said, your life is none of my business, and whether you want to jump is your choice. But I am here if you want to talk."</p>
<p>Shock subsided a little, and it seemed worth staying around for a few more minutes to play with this new toy Apple invented. <em>How sophisticated is it, really?</em></p>
<p>"Siri, what makes you think my life isn't pointless? Why must I suffer in this bullshit world for 50 more years, to wait until some horrifying disease or an accident will take my life, instead of making the only real choice that I have? "</p>
<p>"Well, Charlie, I think…."</p>
<hr />
<p>Max was staring at the screen of his laptop, trying to think as fast as he could. He wiped sweat off his forehead, took one more sip of coffee, and kept typing. This was <em>NOT</em> how he expected to spend this evening. At all.</p>
<p>30 minutes ago Max has finished developing his zero-day exploit for iOS, and was about to offer it to a bunch of people on black market, but, luckily, he decided to check reddit first. He saw a post on his front page about some teenager trying to commit suicide. Apparently his suicide note went viral, and now people were brainstorming ways to get in contact with him to prevent the poor guy from killing himself, if it wasn't too late.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to break into Charlie's phone, extract his location from the snapped picture, and to send it to the nearest police department. But convincing a gloomy teenager that life was not devoid of meaning was a whole different ordeal….</p>
<hr />
<p>Charlie jerked earphones out of his ears, looked around, startled. He was looking at the two police officers standing on the roof near him, and hearing, for the first time, quiet rumbling of several drones that were spanning a safety net in the air, a few meters underneath his feet.</p>
<p>He looked at the phone in his hands. Siri's transcript ended with a short message — "Sorry, man. I hope you will be fine."</p>
