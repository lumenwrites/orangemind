1. "Reality is normal, you're weird."  
   There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for everything; things only seem strange because of your own ignorance.
2. Enemies. being innately evil.   
   that seems obvious enough.+correspondence bias(kickiNg wending ,machine)
3. Majority is always wrong. most popular cant be the best.  
4. Availability heuristic!!  
   Now that is an actually interesting challenge Id like to explain on a metaphor.  
5. Don't trust people just because they sound wise or confident, see if their arguments make sense. no ad homeniem either.  
6. don't choose to believe in things just because it feels better  
   what can be destroyed by the truth shall be. reality is already is, admitting it doesnt make it worse.  
7. never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence. sse randomness. not center around yourself.  
 dont see purpose where  there isnt.  
8. PG: see the world through your own eyes, imitate what you like, not what you're "supposed to" like.  
9. You can't just use skepticism or doubt ti defeat any argument you dislike.     
10. people choose the more charismatic politician and thenn rationalize  backwards  
    same with words. say things that make them feel good, they will rationalize agreeingvwith you afterwards.  
11. Broken Window theory  
   Somebody made a small mistake,
   neglected a tiny flaw,
   and it gradually escalated into a disaster?
12. Straw-Man conversation  
13. Trust  science/rationaliqty more than  your eyes??  
14. practice vs talent  
15. adjusting emotions/beliefs according to probabikities? If it is 10 times less likely it should be 10 times less scary?  
    
Fake explanations? What you predict matters, not what you explain? Names of things don't tell you anything.
Reversed stupidity is not intelligence?
like they dont believe something because bad tribe says that?
science vs politics?
Kyle uses/teaches someone a reciprocation trick?
Everyone is totally winging it all the time. Confident people are just better at hiding it.
If you really believed something, you'd act like it were were true.
It doesnt matter how it looks, just what it causes. Utilitwrian stuff.
//Morals are made up?
Dont expect life to be fair, do what works. What is true and what works is what matters, not fairness.
rationalization
dont grow blank, dont allow yourself to ignore things.
