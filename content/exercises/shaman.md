Sunbeam cut through the tiny interior of a dim and foggy Shaman's tent.
A dirty face peered from behind the coyote skins that were covering the entrance.

Ugu entered. He was dressed in skins and leather, wooden club attached to his belt. In his hands he was carrying several dead rabbits.

"So you're the hunter I take it?" A man sitting in front of the fire looked pretty young for a shaman. He wore simple black clothes, and a grim expression on his face.

"How... how did you know?" Ugu was staring at the shaman in bewilderment.

"I'm a shaman, is that not clear? Spirits told me, of course. So what do you want?"

Ugu gaped at him for a while, then put his dead rabits into a pile of other gifts, and cautiously and respectfully sat down in front of the fire. 

"Ehm... I need your help, err.. shaman?"

"Kyle is my name. So what do you want?"
