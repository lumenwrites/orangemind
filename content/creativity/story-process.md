Now that I’ve told you about [story structure](https://medium.com/p/story-structure-5da799745034), [story essence](https://medium.com/p/story-essence-60576fb1edc4), and [connection between climax and other story elements](https://medium.com/p/how-climax-is-connected-to-other-story-elements-49e22cee3d68) — I will talk about story writing process.

##Story elements

![](https://medium2.global.ssl.fastly.net/max/2000/1*4Y9KY5Em4L2GhR8hwxCFEQ.png)**

There are 4 crucial elements you need to know about your story:

* **Setting** — the world of a story.

* **Characters** — protagonist, antagonist, others.

* **Event** — what happens, event the story is about.

* **Contrilling Idea** (CI) — the “moral” of a story, philosophy you want to express.

Together they form a **High Concept** (HC) — the main story idea, original and interesting concelt you can express in a few words.

When you know what these elements are — you can find the [key structural points](https://medium.com/p/story-structure-5da799745034)(IInc, TP1, MP, TP2, Climax) of a story, and develop a Plot.

That will give you a pretty clear and straightforward idea of what your **3 Acts** are about. Once you know that — you can break the acts into scenes , and create **Outline**. And then use that outline(list of scenes) to simply expand it into writing.

##Process

You find these elements by **asking and answering questions**. In practice any of the elements can be an initial idea/inspiration, the process is chaotic, it involves jumping back and forth between questions, tweaking, randomness, serendipity, imagination, etc, but more on that later. The following is an idealized, orderly version of a process.

##Character in a situation

It makes sense to begin by finding an interesting **setting**, and once you know where your story takes place it is easier to find an interesting **character**.

I also call it “SciFi Premise”, because SciFi/Fantasy tend to revolve around worldbuilding and unusual characters in interesting situations.

##Problem

Once you know the setting and characters, your biggest goal, as I’ve described in the [previous post](https://medium.com/p/how-climax-is-connected-to-other-story-elements-49e22cee3d68) is to find your climax.

It is difficult to come up with climax on it’s own, but as I’ve said, all elements in story are connected, and you can unrawel all of them by starting with one.

In my experience, the easiest one to begin with is **IInc**, or, in other words a **problem**.

Because once you have your character in a setting, you can answer the question “What can go wrong?”

Usually this problem is caused by the antagonist, so if you can figure out who that is it may help you to find the problem.

##Goal

Once you have your problem — you have your IInc, you know where your story has started.

And obviously, you immediately know that the character’s goal is to solve this problem.

So even if you don’t have a very idea of your climax — you know that your character will solve this problem at climax.

##TP1, MP, TP2

Next — you can find TP1 — it is simply the point when character decides to achieve his goal.

Once you know that, you can imagine what difficulties may arise, and how things can escalate, and as they escalate more and more — you know your MP, and as they escalate even further — you can figure out the big final attempt at achieving his goal, and how it can go horribly wrong and fail.

##Climax

Finally, once you know the TP2 — the lowest poit for the character — you can figure out how he will turn things around and solve it at climax.

##Steps

Here’s a convenient list of questions to summarize it:

* **Setting**. What is the world of my story?

* **Characters**. Who are the characters?

* **Problem** (and Goal). What can go wrong? What problem will my character need to solve?

* **Engage**. How does the character start pursuing his goal?

* **Escalate**. How can get more difficult? What obstacles will he face?

* **Lose**. What is his final, biggest, highest-stakes attempt, and how can it fail?

* **Turn** How can I turn lose into win? How does character solve the problem?

##Explore

Once you know the things you are looking for, the main steps you need to take — you search for them by asking questions, thinking, writing.

Usually it is hard to write the story completely top-down(start from outline, find key points, and break things down until you have individual scenes), and it is hard to do it bottom-up(just sitting down, writing, and going wherever it takes you). So I think that the best way is to combine both options and jump back and forth. You think about the outline, you ask questions, you sit down to write, then go back to correcting outline.

If you find yourself unable to answer some of the questions, I suggest to write **a list of 5 **possible options, not the best ones, just somethig that could barely fit, and then pick the one you like the most.

Another useful idea at this point is to just set yourself a goal to write a certain number of words(250 or 500 works well). When you are doing that, you should not think about the outline ormstory structure or theory, just type words, that will help you to find the answers and new ideas.
