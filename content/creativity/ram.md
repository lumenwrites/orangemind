I wanted to figure out how does the process of writing a Rick and Morty episode look like, and here’s the information I could assemble.

They have 3 boards in the writer’s room:

###1. Brainstorming board

They start by brainstorming episode ideas and writing them down on the board.

These are general high concept story ideas that look like this:

###2. Story Circle board

Then they work on a rough story outline. They use Dan Harmon’s story circle that represents the simplified version of Campbell’s Hero’s journey, and looks like this:

You can read more about it in the awesome [series of articles about the story structure](http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit) that he wrote, [here](http://danharmon.tumblr.com/post/57779240046/could-you-explain-your-story-breaking-process) you can read about the process of breaking a story in more details, and [here](http://danharmon.tumblr.com/post/57889437682/could-you-explain-a-particular-community-episode) Dan explains this process using a Community episode as an example.

Sometimes, there are [several circles](http://danharmon.tumblr.com/post/11486838757/from-the-room-in-which-remedial-chaos-theory-was) for different characters or storylines.

If you look closely, you can see that they also have a print out of Campbell’s [monomyth](http://i.imgur.com/kH5vVGM.jpg) on their board.

Here’s how the breakdown of the “Close Rick-Counters” episode look like:

###Outline

Finally they create an outline of the episode, these are just 2 acts broken down into scenes for A and B stories.
