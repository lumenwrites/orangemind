# The Gate

Max, Amber and Kyle sneaked into the minus 8th floor of the top secret laboratory.

Max hacked into the Google Gate servers a few months ago, and since then he was waiting for an alert to pop up on his screen, today it finally happened.

Google Gate was a new moonshot project, aimed to searcing through the enormous space of dimensions, to find the ones where the combination of physical laws and mathematical constants made existence of matter possible. It was incredibly difficult task, possible to complete only with the computational power of Google. Since the beginning of the project in 2028, only 2 worlds were discovered where planets could exist, but none of them were even close to habitable.

Today it changed, and tomorrow the world will know about it. Max managed to postpone the notification scientists working on a project will receive, so now only 3 people in the world knew about the existence of habitable parallel universes, and they had full 4 hours to keep it to themselves.

Dim warm light and quiet hum of the servers made the circular laboratory feel welcoming and relaxing. Determined, Max quickly strode to the mainframe, plugging in his laptop. Amber began preparing the giant cylindrical machine standing in the center of the room. Kyle was putting on a something that looked like a mix between a space suit and a biohazard suit, then he checked the equipment they were planning to get in.

Soon everything was ready, coordinates were established, and all 3 of them were prepared. Max launched the process and joined the other 2 in front of the entrance to the Gate.

Two hours later the team was tied to the pole and surrounded by natives, as the portal was running out of time and energy. It was closing in 20 minuts, and if they won't do anything they will be left here.



# Shaman

Max stood in the center of a laboratory, looking at the signs of deterioration around him.
Colors were slowly fading under the layers of dust.
Finally he was able to move.
He went to the door, and opened it manually - there was no electricity in the building anymore.
He went to the elevator, no luck, of course, so he used the emergency exit.
Exhausted after crawling the 8 floors of stairs, he opened the door into the anteroom and gasped.
Most of the buiding looked half-abandoned, only 1/3rd of the wall was left, enormous glass wall in the entrance was shattered.
He was lucky that his exit was in the center of the building and remained almost intact.
He crawled outside(holding his backpack with his laptop and such) and gasped. The empty lifeless desert surrounded him,
pity remnants of a few buidings stood where one of the biggest technical hubs of civilization used to be.

Sunbeam cut through the tiny interior of a dim and foggy Shaman's tent.
A dirty face peered from behind the coyote skins that were covering the entrance.

"Are you coming in or not?" said the weary and sligtly annoyed voice. It was very hot inside, and a small fire that was burning in the center of the tent wasn't helpting.

Ugu entered. He was dressed in skins and leather, wooden club attached to his belt. In his hands he was carrying several dead rabbits.

"So you're the hunter I take it?" A man sitting in front of the fire looked pretty young for a shaman. He wore simple black clothes, and a grim expression on his face.

"How... how did you know?" Ugu was staring at the shaman in bewilderment.

"I'm a shaman, is that not clear? Spirits told me, of course. So what do you want?"

Ugu gaped at him for a while, then put his dead rabits into a pile of other gifts, and cautiously and respectfully sat down in front of the fire. 

"Ehm... I need your help, err.. shaman?"

"Call me Alex. So what do you want?"

*[to be continued]*

Light hit his retinas though the closed eylids and jolted him awake.

Alex found himelf in a dark tent, chained to a thick wooden log.
He could barely see anything because a lone beam of light was shining in his face, and all the rest faded into a vague crimson glow. For a second he saw a tall silhouette of a man swiping aside skins that were covering the entrance. In a moment everything was dark again.

As his eyes adjusted again, he saw a giant beardy man dressed in crude fragments of animal skins, holding a spear in his hand.

"Who the hell are you?"

"Ugu." said the man angrily, poking him with a spear. "Awake now. Must go. Chief wants speak."

As he was unchained and dragged to the exit, he managed to notice and grab his backpack that was lying a meter away from him.

"Is that the daemon you were talking about, father?" asked Igni, not really trying to keep mocking tone from her voice. Only she could talk to a tribe's chief in that tone, anyone else would be executed immediately. The whole tribe stared at a lean young man as Ugu dragged and dropped him in front of their tent. He had black untidy hair, and dark clothes[...],  He looked nothing like a daemon.

Chief stood up and started speaking "Before you die, deamon, you must tell us how have you survived in the Land Of Desolation, and what have you seen there."

----

Every inch of his body was aching, he was almost passing out in the desert heat, his jeans and shirt were now soaked in sweat. Alex looked up at the Chief.

"What are you talking about, I have no idea what I am doing here."
