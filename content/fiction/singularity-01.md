Sounds of several gunshots echoed in the abandoned metro station.

A few bullets blasted the column right above the Max's shoulder as he dived into the space between trash containers to get away from the line of fire.

He estimated that they had about half a minute, so he got back to vigorously typing in his laptop. "Hey, that's what I call 'agile programming'!"

Kyle didn't appreciate the joke. He was hiding behind another column, watching 4 people in expensive suits and with guns in their hands running in their direction. "You've said it will be safe! You've sayed it will be just a simple job!"

"Well, the next time we will be more careful"

"The *next* time?! You gotta be high to think that I will agree to something like that again!"

Max just smiled. Typing has slowed down and then stopped with the victorious hit on enter key.

"Now we just give it a minute for it to work. Do you have any idea how do we last a minute without getting shot?"

Tiny old house, one of the very few that still left in the center of a big city.
Group of 6 people gathered in the biggest room on the first floor.
All of them looked thoughtful and grim.

"So I take it we're completely screwed, huh?" abscentmindedly mumbled Alice(16 years old, long black hair, very lean) from the couch, without taking eyes off her tablet that was propped against her legs, where she was carefully drawing something. 

"Uh-huh" responded Mike(21 years old, buttoned-up t-shirt with a pocket protector. Seriously.) . He was sitting on the opposite end of the couch, and reading Feynman's lectures on physics(Volume 1) for a 4th time. He was always reading when he was fighting stress. Or not. He was always reading, really.

"How did we manage not to get this one? It was a website for a baking company for ktulhu's-sake!!" asked Amber(22 years old, bulky but comfortable cloth, shuffled red hair), although they all knew perfectly well how "I do not blame Kyle for not pushing on that one, of course" she was sitting on the floor tinkering with wires on the raspberry pi project that she was making. Very, very rarely there was a moment where you could see Amber without a cheerful simle on her face. That was one of thouse moments.

"I'm telling you, guys, I should've negotiated this project. You all are bored to death with this kind of work, and it shows, I don't really care, so I could've talked them into letting you do the job" Usually relaxed and careless Seth(28 years old, slightly overweight, very hairy and beardy) was playing xbox, but he kept losing the same simple level, his heart wasn't in it. The last part of the sentence rose to the intense scream, as a figure on the screen was firing hell on crowds of aliens.

"Yiii-ha!!" Max(22, black shuffled hair and short beard, black jeans and shirt with an orange tie, also in glasses - but regular ones, simple black narrow rectangles. Bright and intent brown eyes, with strikingly sharp and saturated, almost orange retinas) looked up from behind his thinkpad x4, happy smile dawning on his face.

"What?" Kyle(24, shaved head, goatee, long coat, piercing, intent, intelligent sight from behind his augmented reality glases) was standing in the center of the room, staring intently at Max.

"I've got an idea! I've got this friend who..."

"Uu-ugh..." - from every person in the room. Not again.

"No, hear me out!! This time it's legit... Almost. Well, at least less illegal. And *definitely* much less dangerous!" they've had this conversation before, but Max was certain that this time he will convince them. They didn't have much of a choice really. He was the only one really excited about a prospect of doing some hacking - he always found it invigorating - but he was pretty sure that all of them will really enjoy that too, eventually. Even though it really didn't seem possible right now.

"Alright, what do you have?" said Kyle, as everybody were staring at him.

Max's simle grew even wider. I knew this time it will work!! As cautious Kyle was, he was clealry more sick of the boring projects than any of them, and he may not like admitting it, but Max remembered very clearly how excited Kyle was on their last and only hack. Despite how that all turned out... Kyle may not think that hacking is very prudent, but this time he will take the interesting and challenging project he was craving for for so long.

"I have this... acquitance... who says he has a job for us. It won't be like the last time, I promise. It is a small company that doesn't take their security very seriously, and he says that all we need to do is steal some data from them for their competitors. Cmon, let's at least hear what do they have to offer!"

"Fine. Setup a meeting." Kyle's voice was still stern, but his face got noticeably less grim.

Man in the expensive black suit was standing in the middle of the old metro station, looking bemused. Two serious-looking guys in sunglasses(In the metro. At night.) were standing by his sides. "What did you choose this place for?" said the man, a little concerned. "Couldn't we met in starbucks or something?"

Kyle and Max looked at each other. From what Max knew about that kind of meetings from movies, he assumed that the old abandoned metro station was the way to go, besides he thought that this could impress 'an owner of a small company, a regular guy' his acquitance said they were supposed to meet. Now he himself was a little nervous, the guys that were standing in front of them were looking more like some low-level thugs. Thakfully, they were looking confused and unthreatening.

"This is more private" said Kyle, assuming the authoritative tone, Max firmly nodded.

"So" said Max, "what job do you have for us?"

"Recently we learned that our, uhm, competitors, got some data about out company. Private data abot our employees mostly, and also some financial and buisiness information that we would like to keep secret. What you will need to do is to find and destroy all the information they have on their servers about our company"
