Credit for <strong>a lot</strong> of these ideas goes to Eliezer Yudkowsky.
This short story is heavily inspired by <a href="#">HPMOR</a>, and based on essays from the Less Wrong sequence "<a href="#">How to actually change your mind</a>"(because the main purpose of writing these stories is learning to write and think that way).
