That sparks curiosity/question.
You don't have to know all of them from the beginning, you discover them as you go.

# Plot
> Sequence of events leading to achieving/failing a valuable goal
> IInc - creation of a valuable goal
> Climax - achieving/failing the goal
> Event - step closer/farther from a goal.
> Everything inbetween - struggling to get it(conflict)
> Character - your avatar
> Empathy, every step closer/farther to value - emotion
Plot is NOT the only value.
New patterns are value.
- Comedy
- Creative ideas(settings/plots/etc)
- Essays
- Vfx, Sexy ladies, etc.
