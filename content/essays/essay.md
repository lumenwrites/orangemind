Essays are about coming up with new and surprising ideas, and then exploring them.

You write an essay by asking a question and typing your thinking process.

Looking for all the new and interesting ideas that you can find.

There are 2 parts to it:

- Finding questions that nobody else asked before <!-- that other people usually don't -->
- Coming up with surprising and interesting ideas


You ask interesting questions and look for unexpected answers.
You write to create ideas, but you don't know most of the ideas in advance, you create them in the process.

## Finding questions

Assume that everything we know is stupid and wrong.

500 years ago people were dumb and wrong about pretty much everything, so it's likely that 500 years from now that is how people will going to think about us.

Therefore - you are trying to find things that we are wrong about, and you do that by questioning and challenging things that you know.


### Focus/Creative pause

Creative focus is a great technique for doing that, and it is a valuable skill in itself.  

The goal is to find a thing that you want to question/improve/challenge:

- Pick a thing at random  
  There's no reason for you to think that something is wrong about it, you just pick it at random and decide to improve it.
- Find a thing people usually don't think about or question.  
- What are some boring mediocre cliches and default assumptions that everyone is making?  
- What kind of thing is likely to be wrong or just seems weird?
- What are some things that can be improved?
- What are some problems that can be solved?  
  Especially the problems people don't realize they have.
- Stop at some random subject and ask "why are we doing that?"  
  Is there a good reason for the way things are, or is it just a cultural habit/historical accident?
- What are some goals here that can be achieved?

<!-- challenge everything and ask why? -->

Once you've picked a thing for a creative focus - you challenge it.

### Challenge:

Here are the questions you can ask about a subject you've picked that should be a good creative challenges to solve.

- General  
  What are some new ideas in the area x?
- Improve   
  How to improve x?
- Solve.
  How can I solve this problem?
- Alternatives  
  What are some alternatives to doing things this way?
- Drop it  
  If it wouldn't exist, what would we do without it?
â€“ Achieve  
  How do I achieve this goal?


The process of writing essay is the process of answering one of these questions, solving one of these challenges.

In the [next article](/post/creativity) I will describe how to create unexpected/interesting/creative ideas.
