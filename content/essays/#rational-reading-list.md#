So you've read [HPMOR](http://hpmor.com/), it blew your mind, and you're looking for more things like that to read. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find something that would equal it in awesomeness, but I did my best to compile a list of readings that the kind of person who loved HPMOR would enjoy.

This list is compiled mostly from recommendations on [/r/rational](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/), [/r/HPMOR](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/), and my personal must-read list. Items in each category are arranged starting from the best and most awesome, so you can just begin <!-- start --> reading them <!-- starting --> from the top.

<!-- If you have suggestions about this list - you can help me to improve it by leaving your ideas in the comments, or editing this article directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/raymestalez/orangemind/blob/master/content/rational-reading-list.md). -->

- **Ra** and **Fine Structure** by Sam Huges  
	[[link](http://qntm.org/ra)]
	<span class="expand">[Show Description]</span>  
	<div class="description">
> ....it is excellent and everyone who keeps saying, "I liked the part where Harry was trying to figure out the laws of magic[...]" ought to read Ra right now.

	Ra is a story where magic is the unholy combination of particle physics, fluid dynamics, and bizarre programming languages.

	<div class="description">

	> This is simply the best science-fiction book ever written, the Grand Bull
	Moose Award Winner for really really good fiction.  It is, in short, my all-time favorite.
Can you imagine a book where the premise is that human beings have
been scanned into computers as virtual Copies?  "Darn it," you cry,
"now you've spoiled it for me!"  Oh, no, I haven't.  Can you imagine a
book where this concept is introduced on the first page?
That bit about Copies?  That's not the plot.  That's just the starting
assumption.  The surprises this book delivers are unbelievable.  It
shocked the living daylights out of me.
But I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.  So if you want to know more,
read the book

- **Dune** by Frank Herbert  
	[[amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0441172717/)]
	[[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_%28novel%29)] 
	<span class="expand">[Show Description]</span>  
	<div class="description">
	Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family--and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream.
A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what it undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.

	<span class="expand">[Show Description]</span>  
	<div class="description">
	Features a single person with a single, well-defined superpower. The
implications are given a lot of thought, and there are a large number of exploits that are well-
defined. They made a movie out of the book, which wasn't very good. The follow-up, Reflex is
also quite good, and expands on the fictional science. The third in the series,Impulse, leaves
something to be desired and isn't necessary to read. The fourth, Exo, just came out recently,
and I consider it a return to form in most ways.

- **Accelerando** and pretty much anything by Charles Stross.  
	[[amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Accelerando-Singularity-Charles-Stross/dp/0441014151/)]
	[[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando)] 
	<span class="expand">[Show Description]</span>  
	<div class="description">
  Accelerando is what I consider to be the definitive
Singularity novel, and is absolutely densely packed with ideas. The Laundry Files is his James
Bond meets IT department meets Cthulhu series.Palimpsest is his time travel novella, and what
I'd consider one of the single most important entries into that genre. The Merchant Princes is
generally considered to be a love-hate thing, but it goes from "standard worldwalking outsider
fantasy fiction" to some utterly awesome and mindblowing stuff in the late books - get the
British rerelease if you can, which edits things down.  
</div>

- **Worm**  
	[[link](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/)]
	<span class="expand">[Show Description]</span>  
	<div class="description">
  Web serial about superheroes, featuring a lot of interesting superpowers and their applications. THis is the most frequently recommended book to people who liked the creative use of magic in HPMOR, although warning - it's pretty negative and depressing and not really like HPMOR at all. Everybody says it's great so it's worth checking out, but it's not that great in my personal opinion.

## Fantasy

- **The Lies of Locke Amora** by Scott Lynch  
	[[amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Lies-Locke-Lamora-Gentleman-Bastards/dp/055358894X/)]

	<div class="description">
  It is about a bunch of gentleman thieves, has a lot of trickery, deceit, plotting, and meta-plotting. Clever and enjoyable, with lots of the "solving problems under ridiculous constraints" type stuff. It's also has some fantastic worldbuilding.

- **The Name of the Wind** by Patrick Rothfuss   
	[[amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Name-Wind-Kingkiller-Chronicle/dp/0756404746/)]
	[[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Wind)]

	<div class="description">
	Main character is super smart, uses his wits to get out of (and into)
  trouble, and is mostly awesome - there's another book out right now, The Wise Man's Fear, with
  the third, concluding volume coming at some point in the future (and a few short stories in the
  meantime).

- Brandon Sanderson's **Mistborn** and **The Way of Kings**  
	[[link](http://www.amazon.com/The-Way-Kings-Stormlight-Archive/dp/0765365278)]
	[[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_Kings)] 
	<span class="expand">[Show Description]</span>  
	<div class="description">
	Mistborn is a fantasy trilogy that (like most things Brandon Sanderson writes) has a very
  structured magic system, which hides lots of secrets that a clever reader can figure out. I'd
  actually recommend most of what Sanderson has written, if only because of the attention he
  puts towards making his worlds make sense and follow rules. The Stormlight Archives is a
currently unfinished series, but some of the best stuff that he's written - only two of a projected ten books are complete though, so don't start on this if you don't like unfinished things.

	<div class="description">

	> This is simply the best and most beautiful book ever written by the
	human species.  This was the book that launched me on my career in
artificial intelligence and cognitive science.  I don't mean to imply that
those are the only topics covered; Gödel, Escher, Bach also deals with
mathematics, music, art, programming, Zen, philosophy, self-reference,
and everything in the world that is bright and beautiful.  This is the
most intelligent, the deepest, the most beautiful book in the world. 
Period.  End of story.
I'm not alone in this opinion, by the way.  For one thing, Gödel, Escher,
Bach won a Pulitzer Prize.  Or just pick a random scientist and ask ver
what vis favorite book is, and 1 out of 5 will say:  "Gödel, Escher, Bach". 
No other book even comes close.
It is saddening to contemplate that every day, 150,000 humans die
without reading what is indisputably one of the greatest achievements
of our species.  Don't let it happen to you.
Sure, if you're just an average person, you might not understand
everything in this book - but when you're done reading, you won't be an
average person any more.
