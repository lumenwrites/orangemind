## What is a story
Story = Setting + Character + Plot

**Premise** can be a gap in one or all or between any of thouse things.  
That sparks curiosity - question that you want to know but can't predict the answer to.  
You don't have to know all of them from the beginning, you discover them as you go.  

**Value**
## Basic story

Plot(IInc/Goal)
Character
Setting

## Plot
Goal/IInc

Story consists of events, the sequence of all events put together is a plot.  
**Plot** is a sequence of events in a story, leading to achieving/failing a valuable goal.
**Climax** - achieving/failing the goal
**IInc** - creation of a valuable goal
**Event** - step closer/farther from a goal.
> Everything inbetween - struggling to get it(conflict)
> Character - your avatar
> Empathy, every step closer/farther to value - emotion

event  
Meaningful change in character's life.  
Change of value.  
Step towards/away from the goal.

## Bottom-up writing(writing process)

start with one part, ask questions, explore
coding-style

>>>> You do NOT solve the story beforehand by understanding all the theory!!
>>>> You WRITE the story, and this is the source, and you have all the ideas inside, as you go, and THEN you use theory to improve it!!
THIS IS IT. THIS IS WHAT I NEED.
Can you plan django code beforehand? NO. And if you try - it will become way overwhelming before you start!! NO. Start writing it!! Use the theory in the process, to shape it and make it better!!
>>>> You do NOT use the theory solve it beforehand!! 
>>>> You write bottom-up, and then use theory LATER to improve/fill the gaps
//>>>> PRACTICE SHOULD LEAD. You should pick up everythibg else as a side effect!!!!

get answers by asking questions

>>>> You set up an interesting IInc/challenge that creates a cool goal, and then you solve it!!???

>>>> open curiosity gaps and break patterns by making outcomes unexpected(??)

> When you write you setup a situation and predict what happens next
> When you write an essay you ask a question and type down your thought process
- So what, you just take a situation and simulate what happens next? And that is the source?

>>>> You do NOT think>code, you code>think!!!!

>>>> Theory is to improve the writing you already have, not to generate new writing!!!!

>>>> You do NOT use the theory solve it beforehand!! 
>>>> You write bottom-up, and then use theory LATER to improve/fill the gaps

>>>> PRACTICE SHOULD LEAD.
>>>> Code-style simulation procedural writing, looking for a goal(beacon).
>>>> Plots are NOT the source. Code-style Writing is the source.

>>>> Writing like coding works!!
Opens the right specific questions, answers are challenging but doable.
>>>> Source of the story is simulation. Take a situation, predict outcomes. Open gaps to want to continus to read, subvert expectations for it to be interesting.(/valuable, sense of learning new things)
>>>> If McKee plot is not useful as a source for creating a story, maybe joke structure is not useful for creating a joke. What can be a process?
- Essays: Ask a question, type down your thinking process.
- Fiction: Create a situation, simulate the outcomr

>>!
>>>> Discovery writibg + de-bono list all the questions that arise!!

>>>> I can make new stories and workbooks are filled with questions on improving the existing ones!!



Story = setting + character + plot
simple bottom up character in a situation = setting + characacter + problem??
>>>>^^^^!!!!?

Plot = goal//IInc.
what you essentially need is IInc, this is what creates a goal.

So, for now, for practical intencs/purposes,
I might as well say
that to write a story I need
>>>> setting + character + IInc



## Textbook questions to improve


## Writing value Writing path
Value:
Plot is NOT the only value.
New patterns are value.
- Comedy
- Creative ideas(settings/plots/etc)
- Essays
- Vfx, Sexy ladies, etc.

> drama-plots - basic story. //Cleverness - as in BB.
- Simulation/Prediction. Situation > what happens next?
- Simplest story. IInc-goal(climax)-events
- Boring>interesting.Jump to defeat expectations, curiosity gaps.
> scifi - ideas, inventions, world building, munchkinism
> underwood-plots
> comedy
//essay ph/pd

# Pipeline

Comedy:
- Character(s)/Setting/IInc
- Bottom-up explore. Have a draft of something. Scene, chars in a situation doing stuff.
- Use it as a setup for comedy.
That's it!!
NO worries about complex plot/etc.

Fiction:
- Character(s)/Setting/IInc
- Bottom-up explore. Have a draft of something. Scene, chars in a situation doing stuff.
- Search for:
    - Goal/Climax
    - Plot, sequence of most events
- Add textbook story questions
- //style, improvement, blah blah blah

Total Process:
- Character(s)/Setting/IInc
- Bottom-up explore. Have a draft of something. Chars in a situation doing stuff.
- Use it as a setup for comedy.
//  
+ Find Goal/Climax(=Plot).
+ Have a draft with climax.
+ Textbook story questions to improve story.
+ Textbook style/grammar/dialogue/etc questions to polish.
