There are several people who are very inspiring and important to me.
- Paul Graham and Eliezer Yudkowsky
The 2 most clever people that I am aware of. I admire the way they write and think, and want to learn to do that as well.
- Owen Cook(Tyler) from RSD
This is the perfect model of a man that I wish to be. Driven, charismatic, intelligent, just generally awesome. This is how I want to behave and be like.
- Louis CK, Dan Harmon(creator of the shows Community and Rick and Morty) and Randall Munroe(the author of xkcd)
I have enormous respect and love for comedy, just something about the way comedians think is incredibly attractive to me. It takes a lot to be as brilliantly creative as these guys, and I want to learn to think like that.
Others:
Richard Feynman, Kevin Mitnick, Frank Abagnale, Richard Branson - based on their autobiographies, these guys lived cool lives.
Elon Musk - I don't know what kind of person he is, but based on what he does - he is as cool as it gets.
Fictional:
- Walter White, Gregory House
Brilliant person willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goal, not giving up in desperate situations, acting rationally despite the emotions.
- Barney Stinson
Haha this dude is awesome.
- Hank Rearden
Basically a definition of a badass person, created to be the role model for people like me.
- Harry from HPMOR
Not much to explain here, he is also basically a definition of a cool person.
Others: Harvey Specter, Frank Underwood, Ari Gold, Hank Moody. And Tony Stark I guess =)
