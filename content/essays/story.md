This article is about the 2nd biggest challenge in writing fiction, besides generating creaitve ideas - putting these ideas togethre into an engaging, meaningful, and educational experience. 

That is - creating stories.

Alternatively, the process of creating a story is itself a great source of new ideas.

<!-- Writing fiction is the best way to get great at generating creative ideas. -->


## Writing fiction to generate ideas

My goal is to get better at creative thinking, at generating new, unexpected, interesting clever and valuable ideas, and disrupting the default thinking patterns.

As the best tool for that I choose writing fiction.

There are other "creative" fields that require generation of new ideas(writing essays, creating inventions, etc), I chose fiction over them for the following reasons:

- Unlike other fields, fiction's primary focus creating new ideas, not as means to attain something, or as a tool for problem solving, or as a side effect of what you're doing, but for the sake of themselves. <!-- does not have other goals and motives -->
- Unlike the other most important field I'm interesed in - Science and programming - fiction is not bounded by reality. Which makes it's outcome(stories) less "practical" and useful, but gives it a big advantage - 100% of your focus is directed to making new unexpected ideas and disrupting the thinking patterns, without having to be distracted or restricted by othercomplexities and challenges of the real world.
- Fiction allows to express vast variety of very diverse ideas. Inventions, jokes, creative solutions, complex plots, pholosophy - everything that you can see or experience is possible to express through fiction.

## Stories

This is the list of the main types of ideas that stories consist of, the main types of value I am getting out of stoires, the main reasons I enjoy them:

- **Drama** is what makes story an engaging experience to live through.  
  It is a necessary element, because this is what makes a story recognizable as a story. 
  <!-- //Cleverness - as in BB. -->
- Scifi is a source of creative ideas, inventions, new thinking patterns.  
  Scifi changes the world in an interesting way and explores all of it's implications.
  <!-- munchkinism -->
- Comedy - is a type of ideas that I crave and enjoy the most.  
  It breaks the default thinking patterns, and reflects something important and fundamental about creativity and new ideas, which is the reason I crave it so much.
- Underwood plots/Creative Solutions  
  Is the 3rd major type of value I'm getting out of stories.  
  My favorite characters are people like HPMOR!Harry, Walter White, House, Frank Underwood, Michael Scofield, Benjamin Linus, Barney, etc. Because they are brilliant and excellent at inventing sophisticated and creative plots, and this is the kind of thing I enjoy watching and learning about.
- Essay/CI - underlying ideas that author teaches you by the means of a story. Ayn Rand(teaching philosophy) and Eliezer Yudkowsky(teaching rationality) are my favorite examples of authors who express valuable ideas through their stories.
<!-- - Twist/punch - unexpected plot twists, rush of epiphany you get when something incredible about the story is revealed, it is interesting, satisfying, and in many ways similar to a punchline of a joke. -->
<!-- Vfx, Sexy ladies, etc. -->

The rest of the article is mostly focused on the first element - Drama.
On what makes story a story, the essense of it, the most important elements, and the way of creating them.


# Story Structure

## Main elements of the story  <!-- What is a story -->
[![story](/images/story/main-parts.svg)](/images/story/main-parts.svg)

Story = Setting + Character + Plot

**High Concept**(story premise, story idea) can be a gap in one or all or between any of thouse things. It is the big new idea that makes story curious and interesting.  


## Plot

**Event** - is a meaningful change of value in character's life.
<!-- step closer/farther from a goal. -->
<!-- is the outcome of a Goal -->

Story is about a **Big Event** that happens at **Climax**, a moment when character achieves his  **Goal**.
<!-- 99% -->

The Goal is the main value for a character in a story.

**Inciting Incident**(IInc) is an moment <!-- event --> when a main story Goal is created.

Story consists of **Scenes** - smaller events, steps closer-to/farther-away from a Goal.

Everything inbetween IInc and a Climax is about struggling to achieve the goal, series of successful/failed attempts to move closer to the goal, that eventually succeed.

**Plot** is a sequence of all the events in a story put together.

[![plot](/images/story/plot.svg)](/images/story/plot.svg)


### Turning points

**Turning points** are the most important events(scenes) that happen between the IInc and a Climax.

The turning points are the major changes in action.

This is how character goaes about achieving the goal.
Attempts that he makes to get what he want.


**IInc** is a moment where natural course of character's life is disturbed/upset with something, the moment that creates a big goal for characters to achieve.

From here, as he goes forward, things *escalate*, *stakes* get higher, and his commitment to the goal increases.

**TP1**(first Turning Point) is a moment where character decides to go after the goal, makes his first attempt/step towards getting it.

**MP**(Mid-Point) is a point of no return, of full commitment to the goal.
Imagine crossing a river, MP is the moment where character is closer to the other shore(achieving his goal) than to the one he left(the natural course of his life). He can still sink or he can achieve his goal, but now there's no point of going back.

**TP2**(second Turning Point) is a moment when character loses everything and goal seems unattainable. This is the last attempt that dramatically fails.

**Climax** is a major reversal, turning of lose into a win, the moment when character, despite all the odds, makes the last desperate attempt to achieve his goal and succeeds.

### CI. Twist. Creative solution.

These 3 things(or one of them, or a combination of them) is what enables a character to go from "all is lost" to a climax, epiphanies that enable him to win.

<!-- These elements are optional, but they are the top priority to think about, once the core of the story is created. -->

**CI**(Controlling Idea) is the "lesson" character(and reader) learns throughout the story, the reasonf for a meaningful change(Event) to occur.
<!-- The thing that changes the character and enables him to win. -->
<!-- CI/Lesson/moral/Character arc. = Lesson the character learns. -->

It is the "essay" part of a story, underlying "philosophy" and ideas that writer wants to express.

**Twist** - is a plot twist that happens before the climax that creates the rush of the insight. The "Luke, I'm your father" kind of a thing. <!-- 2nd lane through the story. -->

**Creative solution**(in my favorite stories - brilliant elaborate Machiavellian plot) - the idea that a character comes up with, the plan that he executes to achieve his goal.

<!--
I think it's good to have all 3 of them, but at the beginning they are optional/interchangeable, because they're hard to come up with.

There's also various combinations, for example:

- Twist causes philosophical revelation  
  (what twist reveals, and makes him realize his philosophical mistake)
- Philosophical revelation causes twist -  understanding of the 2nd lane  
  (didn't understand the story because he was making a philosophical mistake)
- Twist/revelation enable you to come up with creative solution.  
  
-->

<!--
Just one of them is fine
"Harry escaping Azkaban"
Though he did have revelations about a cloak that enabled him to survive.
-->




### Character

<!-- **Protagonist** -->

Protagonist is a central character of a story.

For reader to care what will happen in a story he needs need to *value* the goals, care about winning and losing.

Protagonist is a reader's "*avatar*" - reader empathises with him, and experiences the story through his eyes.

Everything that is valuable to a character is valuable to a reader, so that when character goes from event to event achieving and losing things, wining and failing, reader experiences everything that happens to character as if it happens to him, learns lessons, engages in conflicts, makes decisions, celebrates victories and suffers defeat.

That is what draws person into a story and makes him engaged.

# Creating a story

## High Concept and Curiosity Gap

High Concept(HC) is the new idea that you come up with when you begin to write a story.
It is what makes it interesting, makes you curious to see what will happen, and makes reader to want to read it.
<!-- HC is a QUALITY of Character/Setting/IInc. -->

HC can be a new idea based on any of the main elements of the story or the combination of them.

To come up with HC you take some boring and default Character/Setting/IInc, and then use techniques for generating new ideas to turn it into something exciting and interesting.

Or you can come up with an interesting and unusual combination of a couple of these elements.

For convenience I define 2 main types of HC:

**Scifi-HC** - it is basically a new and interesting *setting*/*character*.  
Because sci-fi(and fantasy) are mostly based on new intteresting worlds or superpowers and such, the main idea you begin writing sci-fi with is a new and cool setting(world) or a cool character.

**Story-HC** - it is an idea of a new and creative *IInc* - unusual goal or a challenge to solve.
This is what most non-scifi stories start with, and actually is the majority of ideas in fictoinal novels/tv-shows.

<!-- 
For practical purposes, you want to have both:

- first you come up with **Scifi-HC**, a big premise of a story, a world where everything is happening("School of Witchcraft and Wizardry", "On a Firefly ship of space pirates", "In a dream-world of Inception")
- and then you come up with a **Story-HC** specific and interesting story that is happening in this world.

Notice that most of Firefly episodes are based on Story-HC(steal that thing, fight this guy, defent this house, resque that person. -->

<br/>

Examples of HCs based on various elements of a story:

> Character - Dexter - I want to write about a serial killer, but good one, who kills only bad guys.  
> Setting  - Harry Potter - School of magic  
> IInc - Jaws - evil shark attacking a beach  
> Event - Prison Break - Brilliant engineer breaking his brother out of prison  
> CI - Atlas Shrugged - Socialism is bad, selfishness is good, creators get fucked by society, why?  

<!-- Lost - modern people stranded on a mysterious island ? -->
<!-- HC = boring>interesting.
New creative De-Bono idea/lane from either of the elemetns. -->


**Curiosity Gap**("hook", "cliff hanger")  
There is a general advice given to writers that it's a good idea to create a "hook" at the beginning of the story(and at the end of each chapter, and in more places throughout the story) that will catch readers attention, make him curious, and desire to keep reading. 
<!--
That sparks curiosity - question that you want to know but can't predict the answer to.
-->
Sicne HC is the main idea that makes your story interesting, Curiosity Gap is naturally based on HC. It is a promise of cool things to come, expression of HC. It is a questioin that reader wants an answer to very badly.

Formally, the main "hook" of the story is the question created by the IInc, the question such as "Whether the character will succeed or not?", or "What will happen at the climax".

And the "cliff hanger" happens at the end of episodes/chapters, just watch Lost for a ton of excellent examples of that.

I've figured that these 2 concepts have a very similar nature so I've combined them into one.

Examples:

> Transformers start with the scenes of big robots fighting  
> Detective stories start with a mysterious murder  
> Harry Potter starts wit magicians and flying motorcycles and Voldemort's attack  
> Lost starts with a man in a suit waking up in the middle of a mysterious island  
> Inception starts with stealing  
> Fight Club begins with a dude with a gun in his mouth  
> Tangled and Megamind begin with "this is a story of how I've died"

Basically the example of a thing that makes you interested throughout the whole movie happens as soon as possible, promises you that cool things will happen, and/or makes you wonder what the hell is going on.

## IInc
<!-- Challenge/Problem!!  -->
<!-- (Goal<Obstacle<Antagonist(motivation?)). -->

Inciting Incedent is the moment that creates a Goal.

Once you have the character and setting, the most challenging thing to figure out is the main Event of the story(Climax).

IInc and Climax are the 2 sides of the same idea - the Goal.
IInc creates a goal, and at the climax character achieves it.

<!-- Conflict/Opposition - cheatcode for making thouse!! -->

- Obstacles - 80% default way of creating a Goal - "goal to overcome the obstacle"
- Antagonist - 80% default source of the Obstacles.

<!-- **Antagonist**  -->
The challenging thing about creating Antagonist is his motivation  
Ideally - 2 rational, reasonable but uncompatible goals.  
Lazy motivation - "evil", mistake(idiot ball), irrational overreaction, etc.  



Note:
When coming up with Event - DON'T have to know how to achieve it.
Steps to the goal is the process of figuring it out.(plotting)


## Scenes.

Scenes are essentially micro-stories.

They are also about events, step closer/farther away from the goal.

They are about achieving or failing to achieve subgoals, attempts to move forward towards a bigger goal.

One difference to note is that big Story-Events usually(though not always) end up witch a character achieving his goal(Happy Ending), the Scene-Events are about 50/50 between achieving/failing the goal.

Usually alternate, win-lose-win-lose, etc.


# Process

#### Core of the story

//essay-way

- Scifi-HC: Setting/Character. (HC = boring>interesting) 
- Story-HC: IInc=Goal=Event(<Obstacles<Antagonist. Conflict/opposition is a cheatcode.)
- Plot: 3 points between IInc and goal. 3 Attempts. TP1-MP-TP2
- CI. Twist. Creative solution.
<!-- - Comedy from scenes. is the quality of everything-->

[![process essay way](/images/story/process-essay-way.svg)](/images/story/process-essay-way.svg)

You don't have to know all of them from the beginning, you discover them as you go.

These are the main questions to answer.


#### AIMA-CI-way

[![process CI way](/images/story/process-CI-way.svg)](/images/story/process-CI-way.svg)


## Writing process.

You write story by figuring out the answers to the questions above.


There are 2 ways to approach the writing process:  
**Bottom-up(discovery) writing** - you take any small random element of a story and just start writing, exploring world from there as you go.  
**Outline-writing.** - you start with creating the outline, figuring out the main points of a story, and then breaking them down into scenes and adding more details.

The problem with bottom-up writing is that you don't have very much control over the story.
Your story goes wherever your imagination takes you at the current moment, so it's hard to control the high-level design.

The problem with outline-writing is that if you write outline first, it is very hard to come up with the perfect answers to all of the questions, because when you begin you don't know anything about the world or the story.


Which is why it is a good idea to do both at the same time, and treat writing process more like *programming*. Think of bottom-up writing as writing code, and think about outline-writing as thinking about the higher-level design(drawing UML diagrams or some such).

You can't sit down and write a program from start to finish, line by line. And you can't design it perfectly top-down either.
You think on several levels of abstraction. You write small functions and you think about the high-level design at the same time, there's a lot of placeholders, you start with simple prototypes and then improve and extend, and fill in the gaps as you go.


Another important thing is to treat everything as a **procedural** process, where everything is a subject to change. <!-- Everything you do is flexible, more like x than like y -->

> Don't write it like a letter, *develop* it like a program

It is very hard to commit to bottom-up writing without knowing the outline of the story, and it's hard to commit to the outline of the story without knowing the details about the world.

That is why you start with some small part that you can imagine now <!-- penetration point + beacons -->, and then you ask questions and explore from there. <!-- simulation, prediction -->
You take an interesting situation and simulate what happens next, and search for answers to the high-level questions.

### Polish

After you've got the core outline and a draft of a story, you simply take good textbooks and go through the questions from them to fill your story with more details.

- Screenwriting textbooks, such as McKee's book and Screenwriting Bible
- Style and grammar textbooks, such as Stephen King's book and Elements of style or some such
<!-- /dialogue -->

### Writing path

Process should lead. Once you've got the understanding of everything above - you practice, and pick up everything else as a side-effect, during the process.

You tweak and improve and all that as you go, no need to get caught up in small minute details before beginning the process. Information above should be enough to write a basic story, from there you get better and understand further details.

<!-- Practice should lead You do not think>code, you code>think -->

#### Perfect format

To not start with overly and unnecessarily complex things(like long screenplays or novels), I have figured out the best format to begin learning how to write.

It includes all of the essential, the most challenging and important elements, and leaves out all the unnecessary complexity that you don't need at the beginning.

**Diverse funny rationalist cartoon science-fiction short-stories**

- **Short**  
  Somewhere between 500-word flash-fiction, 5-minute collegehumor sketches, and 20-minute sitcom episode.  
  It is important that stories should be short, because it incourages to focus only on things that matter the most. You are not compelled to include any of the unnecessary fluff to make a story longer and more complex that it needs to be, you don't write secondary storylines or do anything overly complex. Just focus on learning to create elements that matter most, in the simplest way possible.  
  At first 1-5 scenes should be enough. 1 scene would be just a climax, 2 scenes would be IInc and climax, and 5 scenes would be the 5 turning points(IInc creates a goal, 3 failed attempts to achieve it, victory at Climax)
- **Diverse**  
  Stories should be set in various worlds and contain various characters(as opposed to one giant novel). That increases the flexibility of what you can do, and the amount of things you can try and experiment with, amount of ideas you can create.  
- **Funny**  
  Enormous amount of value in writing comes from wit and comedy.
  It is very challenging, but also extremely rewarding, and it is the top thing that I want to understand about writing. If you can write comedy - your writing is already awesome. Even if everything else sucks, with great comedy your story will be very entertaining and worth reading.  
  More importantly - it is one of the key skills that I want to develop, because it has so much to do with the way creative ideas work.
- **Science-fiction**  
  It should be scifi. Scifi is very creative and challenging, contains a lot of awesome ideas and inventions. It is on par with comedy at the amount of creative ideas. Besides if you can write great sci-fi you can write pretty much anything else. But why would you - you already can write scifi =)
- **Cartoon**  
  Imagine your stories set in a cartoon'ish world, such as Incredibles/Wall-e, or Rick and Morty, or Harry Potter. First of all that simplifies the world very much. It's much easier to create rational and consistent stories in a simplified cartoon-like world which rules you define, as opposed to dealing with complexities of writing realistic stuff. Cartoon worlds are sharper and simpler and more exaggerated, so you're more focused on things that matters, again, without unnecessary complexity.  
  Besides it supposed to make writing science-fiction and comedy much easier, because your mind has less restrictions and expectations about the cartoon world, and can do crazier things.
- **Rationalist**  
Characters should be rational and intelligent. Minimize the amount of hand-waving and cheating, give everyone intelligent and logical motivations, everything should happen for rational reasons.
Antagonists do what they do for good reasons, not because they're "evil", events happen as the result of conscious actions, not by accident. Everything should be understandable and solvable.
- Treat them like **episodes of a tv-show**  
  That makes you able to switch to a longer and more complex format gradually and effortlessly, whenever you want.  
  Once you have a lot of diverse short stories, you will have a lot of ideas(High Concepts) for different worlds. When you feel competent and confident with writing them, you can just start setting some stories in the same world, and come up with longer story-arcs, of any length you want.
You can just start treating your short stories as episodes of a longer tv-show, which enables you to turn any of your ideas into a longer novel/screenplay/tv-show very naturally and organically.

<!-- visual, present tense. Screenplay-way -->

My favorite examples containing some of these elements are:

- HPMOR(brilliant, rationalist, hilarious)
- xkcd and collegehumor sketches - short comedy
- Rick and Morty and Futurama - cartoonish funny sciencefiction.

That way you can focus on practicing the most important and valuable parts of writing, without any fluff or extra complexity, and once you've mastered that - it should't be a problem to move onto creating more serious, long, or complex stories. Creating anything more advanced will be just a matter of making it longer and adding complexity.

You do NOT use the theory solve it beforehand!! 
You write bottom-up, and then use theory LATER to improve/fill the gaps

Code-style simulation procedural writing, looking for a goal(beacon).
Plots are NOT the source. Code-style Writing is the source.

Writing like coding works!!
Opens the right specific questions, answers are challenging but doable.

Source of the story is simulation. Take a situation, predict outcomes. Open gaps to want to continus to read, subvert expectations for it to be interesting.(/valuable, sense of learning new things)

If McKee plot is not useful as a source for creating a story, maybe joke structure is not useful for creating a joke. What can be a process?
- Essays: Ask a question, type down your thinking process.
- Fiction: Create a situation, simulate the outcome

- Comedy
- drama-plots - basic story.
- Scifi/Underwood plots.
