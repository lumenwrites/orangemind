## Introduction

In the [previous post](/post/creativity) I've explained techniques for coming up with creative ideas.

Here my goal is to explain how comedy works, and to understand the process of writing jokes.
If I am successful, I will be able to teach a person who has no experience of writing comedy to write jokes at will, whenever he wants.

Below are my ideas and hypothesis about how comedy works, if they are correct, after reading and understanding this post, you should be able to take a setup, go through a series of steps, and end up writing a joke(s).
<!-- regardless of how good they are, just has to be recognizable as a joke -->


# What is comedy?

Remember, from the [previous post on creativity](/post/creativity), that we think in thinking patterns(lanes) that are the "trails of thought", everything that you consciously recognie and predict about a situation, or unconsciously expect to be true.

**Lanes**(thinking patterns) **include**:  

- *predictions* a person makes about what will happen,
- his *expectations* about the *outcome* of this situation
- or his *explanations* of what is going on in this situation
- all of the *assumptions* that he makes
- his *interpretations* of what's going on
- etc


Comedy happens when:  
A person realizes that he recognized a wrong pattern, and that his *predictions/expectations/explanations/interpretations/assumptions* that he made about a situation are (**very**)**wrong**, and as a result he *detects mistaken reasoning (that he was not aware of?) and quickly deletes a false version/old-pattern*,
and that's when he laughs.  

In other words, comedy happens when:
Something *break/defeats/shatters* the default *thinking pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation*.

In yet other words, and this is the main definition I will be using here, a person laughs when he recognizes that the lane he took was *very* wrong, and as a result
*his thinking quickly switches to the unexpected, alternative lane*.  

[![joke structure](/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg)](/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg)

**Default lane** - default thinking pattern, everything that you think/predict/expect/assume/interpret/etc by default.  

**The 2nd(alternative) lane** - a new lane that your thinking switches to when you hear the punch-line of the joke.  
The alternative lane is what turns out to be the "right/real" interpretation of the setup <!-- true perception of reality -->, but is very different from what is expected.


**Setup** is what creates(sets-up) a "default" lane.  
Setup is compatible with both of the lanes, but strongly suggests the default one.  
Setup expresses the elements that both lanes have in common. elements that can be interpreted in 2 ways.  
Think of a lane as an underlying trail of thoughts, and of the setup as just words(or images, or behaviors, or situations - depending on the form of a comedy) that expresses this lane.  
The goal of a setup is to cause a person to make certain assumptions/predictions/etc, to take the 1st lane of thought.  

**Punch** is what reveals the 2nd, "alternative" lane.  
Punch is compatible with setup and expresses the 2nd (crazy) lane.  
Punch switches person's interpretation of the setup to the alternative lane.
It is also just words(or images/etc), that express the underlying alternative lane of thinking.  

(The wide) **Gap** is, well, a gap between the default lane and an alternative lane. The difference between the default <!-- perception of the reality --> interpretation of the setup
and an alternative one.

The wider the gap - the better.
It is very important for the 2nd lane to be **very** different, **extremely** unexpected. It should seem "crazy".

### The difference between xthe jokes and creative ideas

When you create a new idea(with "Jump>Move" method), you take a crazy idea, and then find a way to make it compatible with reality, that way you turn a crazy idea into something that makes sense. That way you can look at the reality in a new but valid way.

When you write jokes, the alternative (crazy) lane does **not** have to be compatible with reality, only with the setup.

That is the function of a setup - to be compatibe both with our expectations about reality and the crazy lane. Then, when the crazy lane turn out to be the correct one, our expectations are shattered and we laugh.

### Example of a joke:  
> My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep.... But the kids on the bus were screaming.

In this joke, when you hear the **setup**(*My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep....*)
your brain recognizes a **thinking pattern**, and you make all kinds of assumptions - *you imagine an old man lying peacefully in his bed*, when you hear the **punch-line**(*But the kids on the bus were screaming.*) you immediately switch lanes(*image of a bus and a sleeping driver*), you realize that your default interpretation of the reality was *very* wrong, your brain detects the mistaken pattern, and that's when you laugh.


Another Example:

>	Doctor's appointment.  
	- I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.  
	- But why?  
	- So I could examine you.  

**Setup**: "Doctor's appointment. 'I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.' 'But why?'"  
**Default lane**: Image of a doctor, a patient, the doctor gives him healthcare advice.  
**Alternative lane**: Image of a dude jerking off in front of the doctor.  
**Punch**: "So I could examine you."


The alternative lane is *compatible with the information given(the setup), makes sense in the hindsight.* Yet your *predictions/explanations/expectations/assumptions/interpetations*
were *very wrong*.


----


# Creating comedy

To create comedy, your goal is to find an alternative lane(*pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome*) that is *very different* from the default lane that setup lead a person towards,
but *compatible with the information you have setup, makes sense in the hindsight.*

These are the 2 very important properties of the alternative lane, **both** of which should **necessarily** be true.

Alternative lane, should be **both**:  
*crazy/over-the-top/extremely-unexpected/very-different* <!-- very-not-true/wrong/ -->  
and at the same time  
*compatible with the setup, consistent with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.*  

If the alternative lane will not be **very** different - joke will not be very funny, thinking will not switch to something completely unexpected.

If the alternative lane is very different and crazy, but not **compatible** with the information given in setup - it will be just a non sequitur, some crazy unrelated statement that does not switch thinking to the alternative lane.

This(finding the **very different** yet **compatible** alternative lane) is the main challenge in comedy, and this is what makes it hard.



----

# Finding the alternative lane

So, our brains think in patterns.
When we think, we follow lanes, the trails of thought.
New thoughts logically flow from the previous ones and lead to the next thoughts.

This is the "normal", the "default" mode of thinking. The normal/default thoughts lead to other, normal, default, familiar, and expected thoughts.

When we create comedy(or any new and creative ideas), our goal is to find/create the new, unexpected patterns. To do that we need to break out of the normal thinking patterns, to find the trails of thoughts that we would not find by following the "normal" trails of thought step by step.

How do you find a 2nd alternative lane that is both **new/unexpected** and **compatible** with the setup?

- You can start with *compatible*, and search for ways to make it *new/unexpected*.  
  (**"Searching for the alternatives"**).

- You can start with *new/unexpected* and search for ways to make it *compatible*.  
  (**"Jump>Move"**).


<!-- 
In other words - you start with a random and "crazy" idea that has nothing to do with the setup, and that enables you to break out of the default thinking patterns, and then - you find a connection between this idea and a setup, and turn it into something compatible.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both of the methods.

In the 1st case you are essentially just following your normal thinking pattern, but with a conscious intention to look for the interesting/unexpected alternatives.  
Advantage of this method is that it is very "natural", and in many cases may be easier.  
The disadvantage is that with this method you are still following the "default" thinking lane, and that means that you will not always be able to find some unexpected alternatives (after all, "unexpecded" by definition means that it is not something you would normally think about), and the other disadvantage is that you may not be able to find/create something truly crazy/hilarious/unexpected.

?This method seems very simple and straightforward. The downside of this method is that sometimes it's hard to find connectors with 2 lanes from a setup/situation.

Also it is hard to imagine how a lot of high-level jokes or funny stories to be made using this method.

I think that most of the double entendres, and most of the jokes based on the words with double meaning are made by the first method, because in that case you can just find a word that has a double meaning, and a 2nd meaning of this word will be the unexpected/unintended one.

But I suspect that a lot of truly crazy/hilarious/original comedy(xkcd, Community, Rick and Morty) would not be created using this method.

The second method is more universal, unusual and interesting.
The advantage is that the space of really new/crazy ideas available with this method is way bigger than in the 1st case.
The "disadvantage" is that it may seem less "natural' and a bit more challenging/complex.
-->

### Searching for the alternatives

You take the a setup/situation, look at all of it's elements/properties, and search for the *new* and unexpected alternatives.


1. Take a setup/situation, look at all of it's elements/properties.  
   Everythign that it **directly** describes. 
   In case of a joke it's words, in case of an image/tv-show is everything that you see.

<!--
	Examples of the **elements/properties**:  

	- *predictions* a person makes about what will happen,
	- his *expectations* about the *outcome* of this situation
	- or his *explanations* of what is going on in this situation
	- all of the *assumptions* that he makes
	- his *interpretations* of what's going on
	- expected *behavior* or *reaction* in a particular situation(or from a particular person).
	- *opinions* and *attitudes* about things
	- expeted *meanings* of words/phrases
	- etc
-->
2. Look for all the elements/properties that may have double meanings/interpretations/etc.

3. If you don't find any obvious ones - look at the elements one by one, and consciously search for **alternatives/associations**.


These can be:

- Alternative *meanings* of the word
- Alternative *outcomes* of a situation
- *Associations* that you have with an idea
- Alternative *explanations/interpretations*
- Etc

[![setup turn](/images/comedy/setup-turn.svg)](/images/comedy/setup-turn.svg)


**Associations**(and metaphors?) seem like a very interesting, general, and universal way of looking for connected alternatives, focus special attention on them.

After you find some alternatives(they don't have to be too unusual or hilarious ones) you make them more unusual and unexpected by using methods such as **exaggeration**.

<!-- Or - take a situation(setup) and look at all the elements/properties, and try to find the alternative lanes. -->


### Jump>Move


1. Take a setup/situation, look at all of it's elements/properties.
2. Take one element, and then "jump" from it - flip it upside down, turn it into it's opposite, make it extremely exaggerated, etc.  
 (*Turn a normal element into a crazy idea.*)
3. And then "move" - try to find a way to "connect" this new crazy idea to the setup, explain how that could make sense.  
(*Find a connection/association between this crazy idea and the setup.*)


[![setup jump](/images/comedy/setup-jump.svg)](/images/comedy/setup-jump.svg)


#### Jump
Jump is a method for breaking out of the default thinking patterns, for intentionally generating "crazy" ideas.


When you "jump" your goal is to create
*crazy/very-not-true/wrong/over-the-top/insane* but *new* ideas.


These ideas should *not* be funny, or "creative", or "valuable" or make any sense at all.  <!-- be connected to reality at all in any way. -->
The only purpose of this step is to take you away from the normal/default trail of thinking, and the only thing they should be is **new**.


Types of jump:

- Reversal  
  Take an element and turn it into it's complete opposite, flip it upside down.
- Exaggeration  
  Take an element and exaggerate it way out of proportion.
  Change it's size, importance, amount, etc.
- Connect to a random lane <!-- field -->  
  Take a random word, or a subject, and assign one of it's properties to the element.
- Reorder  
  Change the order in which things are done.

<!--
- Perspective (Max angle)
- Straightforward
-->


### Move
<!-- ~crazy association?? -->
> New ideas(and jokes) are sparkling through the gap between the default and crazy.

When you "move", your goal is to find a way to connect/associate the "crazy" idea you've made during the jump to the setup. <!-- make it compatible with reality. -->

Move is the process of "seriously thinking on crazy stuff".  
(Rationally explain the insane thing)
<!-- and this is how you find a conector?? -->


Ways to move:

- Why? How? Explain.  
  Thinks about why such thing could happen, how that can be possible, try to explain it.
- Imagine.  
  Visualise this crazy idea, imagine how it would work, think about all of it's implications.
- Positive aspect  
  Find a positive aspect of the crazy isea. What is good about it? What would actually make sense?
- Situation in which it could be useful  
  Imagine a situation where it would make sense, where it could be good and useful.
- Difference  
  List the differences between the crazy idea and the "real/default" world. Which of them make sense? Which of them are good/possible? How would it make the world better/worse? What if the opposite would happen?

<!-- Important thing: the 2nd lane is **not** the same as the "crazy idea". ? -->
<!-- 2nd lane lies inbetween the "crazy" lane idea and the "default" lane?? <<<< -->

You find the second lane in the process of trying to connect the "crazy idea" with the.
This steps connects the 2 lanes, make the "crazy idea" sensible in the hindsight, and that makes a joke.

### Resources
A lot of these ideas are inspired by these wonderful books:

# Setup/Misdirection
"He told me he's done it several times. I mean used the word"
> The art of creating a punch is fiding an alternative lane in what already exists
> The art of creating a setup is saying things with 2 meanings, 2 lanes
> The art of misdirections is saying things with 2 meanings, the default one is misleading
"Blah blah blah, and by blah blah, I mean blah blah".
"If by x you mean y and z, then yes"

- Misdirection is more like a trick than a core method
You can phrase a setup in a way that misleads a person into wrong lanes, creates wrong assumptions.
In this method you basically start with a 2nd lane(the one that the punch line) is based on, and then you come up with a setup that is compatible with it, but strongly suggest a different meaning. -->

**The Nexus**  
The nexus is what makes the 2nd lane compatible with the setup, consistent with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.

The 2nd lane should seem "crazy", but also "true". For a person to switch lanes of thinking he has to believe the 2nd lane, buy-into it.

Important thing to note - is that the 2nd lane should be compatible/consistent with the *information given in setup*, but *not necessarily* with the real world as we expect it to be. That is what allows it to be "crazy" and "true" at the same time. It is "true" to the setup, it is connected/associated with it in some way, but it is extremely unexpected or just completely crazy compared to reality.


### Why is it hard?

Finding a 2nd lane with both of these elements is what makes comedy challenging.

Finding a 2nd lane that is compatible with the setup is easy, you just list all the possible explanations/outcomes/etc that make sense. But it will not be funny, it will be just boring.
(*example*)

Finding a crazy idea that is not compatible with the setup is also easy, you just list random unrelated crazy things, but it will be just that - crazy. It will not be funny because it is not connected or associated with a setup in any way, it is just a nonsequitir.

But for a joke to work the 2nd lane has to containt both of thouse elements, and the rest of the article is about ways for searching that kind of lanes.

<!-- #### 3 Jump>Move

This method is more complex, and requires understanding of some new concepts, but I also think that it is the most interesting and the most universal one.

It is the main reason I am writing this article, I am hoping that it will be possible to create more complex and high-level types of comedy with this method.

Creation of a lot of the most hilarious comedy(xkcd, community) is unlikely to be explained by the first 2 methods, but I think that this one *may* be formalizing the thinking process really cool comedians are going through, but are struggling to explain.

Rest of the article explains the concepts you need to understand to use it and the steps for doing that.
