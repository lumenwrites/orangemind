## Introduction

My goal is to explain how comedy works, and to understand the process of writing jokes.
If I am successful, I will be able to teach a person who has no experience of writing comedy to write jokes at will, whenever he wants.

Everything below is my hypothesis about how comedy works, and if it is correct, after reading and understanding this post, you should be able to take a setup, go through a series of steps, and end up writing a joke(s).


## Background (how mind works)

The main function of a brain is to make predictions about the world.
(when you can predict what happens next you are better at survival and reproduction).

Brain makes predictions by learning(memorizing) and then recognizing patterns.

### Default thinking patterns

When you think you follow a sequence of familiar, memorized steps, to go from one thought to another.
These are "thinking patterns", I will call them "**lanes**"

Example:  

	What is the last worrd at the end of this _______?

You can naturally fill the last word(sentence) because you have recognized the beginning of a familiar pattern, and can predict what happens next.

More examples of patterns:

	A B C D _ F
(you can predict that the 5th letter is F)

	1 2 3 4 _
(5)

	Wake up > Drink Coffee > ________
(Dress and Go to work.)

<!-- More complex, high-level ones: -->

	I see a man in a business suit >?he is probably successfull and competent
When I see a person that looks a cerain way, this is how he is supposed to act.

	?Example
This kind of a situation usually have this kind of ouctome

	I see man and woman holding hands > they are probably in love
When I see a certain kind of a situation it usually has this explanation.

**Types of Lanes**(thinking patterns):  

- *prediction* a person makes about what will happen, his *expectations*
- or his *explanation* of what is going on in this
- all of the *assumptions* that he makes about what he perceives
- his *interpretations* of what's going on
- etc

### New ideas and inventions

Examples above were the examples of the "default" lanes.
New ideas are the patterns that nobody has recognized before.

When scientist invent new laws or formulas - they are essentially finding new (unexpected) patterns, and then teaching other people to recognize these patterns.

When writers write fiction, they setup situations and then show the unexpected outcomes.

People value new thinking patterns very much and enjoy learning them<!-- (especially when they are valuable) -->. Similarly people value destroying the wrong patterns(finding mistakes in their thinking).

I have a strong viceral sense that the concepts of curiosity, creativity, and comedy have something very similar with each other. Based on that theory of mind, here are quick definitions of creativity and curiosity:

Creativity is the process of finding/creating the new patterns.

Curiosity is what people experience when they are faced with a question that they can not predict the outcome of. The more valuable it is to predict that outcome the more curious people are.
	
## What is comedy

### Comedy happens when:  
A person realizes that the assumption(based on a default thinking pattern) <!-- *(that he was not aware of?)*   --> that he made about a situation was (very)wrong, and as a result he *detects mistaken reasoning and quickly deletes of a false version/old-pattern*  
and that's when he laughs.  



*thinking pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome*

(default lane and alternative lane)

### To achieve that effect, your goal is to:
*break/defeat/shatter* the default  
*pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome*

### To do that you need to
find an alternative *pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome*
that is *very different* from the default one that a person has made,
but *compatible with the information you have, makes sense in the hindsight.*

<br/>

## Joke structure.
[![Joke Structure](/images/joke-structure.png)](/images/deep-learning/deep-learning-roadmap.png)


### **Example:**

>	Doctor's appointment.  
	- I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.  
	- But why?  
	- So I could examine you.  

Explanation:

**Default lane**: Doctor, patient, doctor gives him advice.  
**Alternative lane**: Dude jerks off in front of the doctor.

<br/>

It is *compatible with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.* Yet your
*pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome*
was *very wrong*.

<br/>



### The main challenge in comedy
is finding that *(very-not-true)alternative.*  
That is both *(very)different* and *'wrong',*  
and at the same time  
*compatible, makes sense in the hindsight.*

<br/>

### There are 3 ways to do that.

#### 1 Connectors > Crazy Alternatives
Look at all the elements/properties of the situation that you have  
(connectors)  
(that may have double meaning, (very not true)alternative explanation/etc)  
and look for them  

#### 2 Crazy Alternatives > Connectors
Come up with a crazy idea first, and then 'move', find a way to connect it  





<!-- #### 3 Misdirection -->
<!-- //You can use misdirection   -->


<!-- Example of writing a joke -->

<!-- 5 Setups, take a person through steps of writing a joke -->

<!-- Link to a post about writing setups. Comedy is a quality, 2 characters in a situation, fiction is a source, etc. -->

<!-- Theory of comedy. Prediction: J should be able to write a joke based on these setups. -->


<!-- Request -->
If anything is confusing or unclear to you - please leave a comment.
If you have any questions - let me know.
Also please take the setups that I've provided, and try writing a joke based on them.
Briefly show me your thinking process, and the resulting jokes.
Tell me what worked and what didn't. What was easy and where you struggled.
If it didn't work for you - let me know.
If you need help at one of the steps or more examples - tell me.
And the success rate, how many of the attempts resulted in a joke.

Also if this post helped you and you are feeling grateful, the best thing you can do(besides leaving feedback) - is to share this post with your friends or on social networks.
