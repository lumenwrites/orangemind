## Introduction

My goal is to explain how comedy works, and to understand the process of writing jokes.
If I am successful, I will be able to teach a person who has no experience of writing comedy to write jokes at will, whenever he wants.

Everything below is my hypothesis about how comedy works, and if it is correct, after reading and understanding this post, you should be able to take a setup, go through a series of steps, and end up writing a joke(s).
<!-- regardless of how good they are, just has to be recognizable as a joke -->

## Background (how mind works)

The main function of a brain is to make predictions about the world.
(when you can predict what happens next you are better at survival and reproduction).
 
Brain makes predictions by learning(memorizing) and then recognizing patterns.

### Default thinking patterns

When you think you follow a sequence of familiar, memorized steps, to go from one thought to another.
These are "thinking patterns", I will call them "**lanes**"

Example:  

	What is the last worrd at the end of this _______?

You can naturally fill the last word(sentence) because you have recognized the beginning of a familiar pattern, and can predict what happens next.

More examples of patterns:

[![thinking patterns](/images/comedy/thinking-patterns.svg)](/images/comedy/thinking-patterns.svg)


<!-- More complex, high-level ones:

	I see a man in a business suit >?he is probably successfull and competent
When I see a person that looks a cerain way, this is how he is supposed to act.

	?Example
This kind of a situation usually have this kind of ouctome

	I see man and woman holding hands > they are probably in love
	When I see a certain kind of a situation it usually has this explanation.
-->	

**Lanes**(thinking patterns) **include**:  

- *predictions* a person makes about what will happen,
- his *expectations* about the *outcome* of this situation
- or his *explanations* of what is going on in this situation
- all of the *assumptions* that he makes
- his *interpretations* of what's going on
- etc

Basically lanes are the "trails of thought", everything that you consciously "think" about a situation, or unconsciously expect to be true.

### Creativity

Examples above were the examples of the "default", "normal" lanes.

Creativity is the process of finding/creating the new, unexpected, abnormal thinking patterns.
The goal of creativity is to break out of the default/normal patterns, and create/search for new ways of thikning, new, alternative lanes.

New "creative" ideas/discoveries/inventions are the thinking patterns that nobody has recognized before.

For a thought to be called an "idea" it has to have 2 properties:

- It has to be new
- It has to be valuable

This is what ideas are - just thoughts that are "*new*" and "*valuable*".

When scientists invent new laws or formulas - they are essentially finding new (unexpected) patterns, and then teaching other people to recognize these patterns.

[![discovery](/images/comedy/discovery.svg)](/images/comedy/discovery.svg)


When writers write fiction, they setup new situations and then show the unexpected outcomes.

[![fiction idea](/images/comedy/fiction-idea.svg)](/images/comedy/fiction-idea.svg)

People value the new and unexpected thinking patterns, and enjoy learning them.<!-- (especially when they are valuable).--> Similarly people value destroying the old and wrong patterns(finding mistakes in their thinking).

And as you will see, this process is very much related to the process of creating comedy.


<!-- I have a strong viceral sense that the concepts of curiosity, creativity, and comedy have something very similar with each other. Based on that theory of mind, here are quick definitions of creativity and curiosity: -->


<!-- Curiosity is what people experience when they are faced with a question that they can not predict the outcome of. The more valuable it is to predict that outcome the more curious people are. -->

# What is comedy?

Comedy happens when:  
A person realizes that the assumption(based on a default thinking pattern) that he made about a situation was (very)wrong, and as a result he *detects mistaken reasoning (that he was not aware of?) and quickly deletes a false version/old-pattern*,
and that's when he laughs.  

In other words, comedy happens when:
Something *break/defeats/shatters* the default *thinking pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation*.

In yet other words, and this is the main definition I will be using here, a person laughs when he recognizes that the lane he took was *very* wrong, and as a result
*his thinking quickly switches to the unexpected, alternative lane*.  

[![joke structure](/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg)](/images/comedy/joke-structure.svg)

**Default lane** - default thinking pattern, everything that you think/predict/expect/assume/interpret/etc by default.  

**The 2nd(alternative) lane** - a new lane that your thinking switches to when you hear the punch-line of the joke.  
The alternative lane is what turns out to be the "right/real" interpretation of the setup <!-- true perception of reality -->, but is very different from what is expected.


**Setup** is what creates(sets-up) a "default" lane.  
Setup is compatible with both of the lanes, but strongly suggests the default one.  
Think of a lane as an underlying trail of thoughts, and of the setup as just words(or images, or behaviors, or situations - depending on the form of a comedy) that expresses this lane.  
The goal of a setup is to cause a person to make certain assumptions/predictions/etc, to take the 1st lane of thought.  

**Punch** is what reveals the 2nd, "alternative" lane.  
Punch is compatible with setup and expresses the 2nd (crazy) lane.  
It is also just words(or images/etc), that express the underlying alternative lane of thinking.  

(The wide) **Gap** is, well, a gap between the default lane and an alternative lane. The difference between the default <!-- perception of the reality --> interpretation of the setup
and an alternative one.

The wider the gap - the better.
It is very important for the 2nd lane to be **very** different, **extremely** unexpected. It should seem "crazy".

<!--
That is why, some good ways to think about the 2nd lane are:

- Crazy alternative
- Very-different-not-true> interpretation
- "Wrong "interpretation
- Over-the-top
-->

# Creating comedy

If you already have a setup, your goal is to find an alternative lane(*pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome*) that is *very different* from the default lane that a person took,
but *compatible with the information you have setup, makes sense in the hindsight.*

These are the 2 very important properties of the alternative lane, **both** of which should **necessarily** be true.

Alternative lane, should be **both**:  
*crazy/over-the-top/extremely-unexpected/very-different* <!-- very-not-true/wrong/ -->  
and at the same time  
*compatible with the setup, consistent with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.*  

If the alternative lane will not be **very** different - joke will not be very funny, thinking will not switch to something completely unexpected.

If the alternative lane is very different and crazy, but not **compatible** with the information given in setup - it will be just a non sequitur, some crazy unrelated statement that does not switch thinking to the alternative lane.

This(finding the **very different** yet **compatible** alternative lane) is the main challenge in comedy, and this is what makes it hard.

<br />

Creating a joke from a setup is just a special case of the more universal way of making jokes.
To create a joke from scratch, the main thing you need to do is to find these 2 "intersecting" lanes.

- One of them should be the default, the "natural" lane of thinking.

- The second should be the "crazy" alternative lane of thinking.

- These lanes should "intersect". By "intersecting" I mean that they should have some elements in common, elements that can be interpreted in 2 ways, elements that are compatible with the both of them.

After you find these 2 lanes:

- you write a setup, that is compatible with both of the lanes, but strongly suggests the default one,

- and then you write punch that switches person's interpretation of the setup to the alternative lane.





<!-- Hence - the following 2 concepts: -->

<!--
Example of a joke:  
> My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep.... But the kids on the bus were screaming.

In this joke, when you hear the **setup**(*My grandfather died peacefully in his sleep....*)
your brain creates a **thinking pattern(assumption, lane)** - *you imagine an old man lying peacefully in his bed*, when you hear the **punch-line**(*But the kids on the bus were screaming.*) you immediately switch lanes(*image of a bus and a sleeping driver*), you realize that your default interpretation of the reality was *very* wrong, your brain detects the mistaken pattern, and that's when you laugh.


Another Example:

>	Doctor's appointment.  
	- I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.  
	- But why?  
	- So I could examine you.  

**Setup**: "Doctor's appointment. 'I'm sorry, but you will have to stop masturbating.' 'But why?'"  
**Default lane**: Image of a doctor, a patient, the doctor gives him healthcare advice.  
**Alternative lane**: Image of a dude jerking off in front of the doctor.  
**Punch**: "So I could examine you."


The alternative lane is *compatible with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.* Yet your *pattern/prediction/explanation/expectation/assumption/interpetation/outcome*
was *very wrong*.

-->


<!--
**The Nexus**  
The nexus is what makes the 2nd lane compatible with the setup, consistent with the information given, makes sense in the hindsight.

The 2nd lane should seem "crazy", but also "true". For a person to switch lanes of thinking he has to believe the 2nd lane, buy-into it.

Important thing to note - is that the 2nd lane should be compatible/consistent with the *information given in setup*, but *not necessarily* with the real world as we expect it to be. That is what allows it to be "crazy" and "true" at the same time. It is "true" to the setup, it is connected/associated with it in some way, but it is extremely unexpected or just completely crazy compared to reality.


### Why is it hard?

Finding a 2nd lane with both of these elements is what makes comedy challenging.

Finding a 2nd lane that is compatible with the setup is easy, you just list all the possible explanations/outcomes/etc that make sense. But it will not be funny, it will be just boring.
(*example*)

Finding a crazy idea that is not compatible with the setup is also easy, you just list random unrelated crazy things, but it will be just that - crazy. It will not be funny because it is not connected or associated with a setup in any way, it is just a nonsequitir.

But for a joke to work the 2nd lane has to containt both of thouse elements, and the rest of the article is about ways for searching that kind of lanes.

# Finding the alternative lane

## From the setup

So, our brains think in patterns.
When we think, we follow lanes, the trails of thought.
New thoughts logically flow from the previous ones and lead to the next thoughts.

This is the "normal", the "default" mode of thinking. The normal/default thoughts lead to other, normal, default, familiar, and expected thoughts.

When we create comedy(or any new and creative ideas), our goal is to find/create the new, unexpected patterns. To do that we need to break out of the normal thinking patterns, to find the trails of thoughts that we would not find by following the "normal" trails of thought step by step.

How do you find a 2nd alternative lane that is both **new/unexpected** and **compatible** with the default one?

1. **Searching for the alternatives**  
You can start with *compatible*, and search for ways to make it *new/unexpected*.  
You can take the setup/situation, look at all of it's elements, and search for the *new* and unexpected alternatives.

2. **"Jump>Move"**(the reason I call it that is explained below)  
You can start with *new/unexpected* and search for ways to make it *compatible*.
In other words - you start with a random and "crazy" idea that has nothing to do with the setup, and that enables you to break out of the default thinking patterns, and then - you find a connection between this idea and a setup, and turn it into something compatible.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both of the methods.

In the 1st case you are essentially just following your normal thinking pattern, but with a conscious intention to look for the interesting/unexpected alternatives.  
Advantage of this method is that it is very "natural", and in many cases may be easier.  
The disadvantage is that with this method you are still following the "default" thinking lane, and that means that you will not always be able to find some unexpected alternatives (after all, "unexpecded" by definition means that it is not something you would normally think about), and the other disadvantage is that you may not be able to find/create something truly crazy/hilarious/unexpected.

?This method seems very simple and straightforward. The downside of this method is that sometimes it's hard to find connectors with 2 lanes from a setup/situation.

Also it is hard to imagine how a lot of high-level jokes or funny stories to be made using this method.

I think that most of the double entendres, and most of the jokes based on the words with double meaning are made by the first method, because in that case you can just find a word that has a double meaning, and a 2nd meaning of this word will be the unexpected/unintended one.

But I suspect that a lot of truly crazy/hilarious/original comedy(xkcd, Community, Rick and Morty) would not be created using this method.

The second method is more universal, unusual and interesting.
The advantage is that the space of really new/crazy ideas available with this method is way bigger than in the 1st case.
The "disadvantage" is that it may seem less "natural' and a bit more challenging/complex.


### Searching for the alternatives
[![setup turn](/images/comedy/setup-turn.svg)](/images/comedy/setup-turn.svg)

Or - Take a setup/situation, look at all of it's elements/properties, and then try to come up with alternatives.


Search for things that have double meanings or 2 alternative explanations/interpretations/etc.



After you find some alternatives(they don't have to be too unusual or hilarious ones) you make them more unusual and unexpected by using methods such as exaggeration.

<!-- Search for things(possible connectors) that have double meanings or 2 alternative explanations/interpretations/etc.

Or - take a situation(setup) and look at all the elements/properties that may have double meanin/nterpretations, and try to find the alternative lanes.
 -->

### Jump>Move

[![setup jump](/images/comedy/setup-jump.svg)](/images/comedy/setup-jump.svg)

This method consists of 2 separate steps:

1. Create a crazy but *new* idea("jump").
<!-- (crazy lane, 3rd lane, not connected lane) -->
2. Find a connection/association between this crazy idea and the reality.

Find a way to connect/associate/make it compatible with the reality, 
<!-- make it "make sense". Find/create a connector and the 2nd lane, in the process of moving?? -->


### Jump
Jump is a method for breaking out of the default thinking patterns, for intentionally generating "crazy" ideas.

When you "jump" your goal is to create:  
*crazy/very-not-true/wrong/over-the-top/insane ideas*  
<!-- crazy alternative. -->
<!-- (comic reality? Looking for crazy.) -->


These ideas should *not* be funny, or "creative", or "valuable" or make any sense at all.
The only purpose of this step is to take you away from the normal/default trail of thinking, and the only thing they should be s **new**.

In other words - completely crazy, not connected to reality at all in any way.


#### Types of jump
- Reversal
- Exaggeration
- Random
- Reorder
- Connect to field
- Perspective (Max angle)
- Straightforward

<!-- example -->

<!-- is the step where you create an unconnected *crazy idea*, the 3rd lane. -->
<!-- **Move** this is where you find a connector, the *crazy association*. -->

### Move //~crazy association??
Goal - create/find crazy/new  
connection/association/reinterpretation/alternative  
by seriously thinking on crazy stuff.  
(Rationally explain the insane thing, and this is how you find a conector??)

- Positive aspect
- Difference
- Imagine
- Situation in which it could be useful

// why? how? explain? imagine?

//thoughts sparkling through gaps between default and crazy.

this is where you find a the *crazy association*, try find a connection between the "crazy idea" and reality. 

Important thing: the 2nd lane is **not** the same as the "crazy idea". You find the second lane in the process of trying to connect the "crazy idea" with the reality?

Just trying to make crazy idea make sense will not work?

2nd lane lies inbetween the "crazy" lane idea and the "default" lane?? <<<<

This steps connects the 2 lanes, make the "crazy idea" sensible in the hindsight, and that makes a joke.


shirley/annie - buddy/detectives.
You don't have to find the association, you can make one.

<!-- #### 3 Jump>Move

This method is more complex, and requires understanding of some new concepts, but I also think that it is the most interesting and the most universal one.

It is the main reason I am writing this article, I am hoping that it will be possible to create more complex and high-level types of comedy with this method.

Creation of a lot of the most hilarious comedy(xkcd, community) is unlikely to be explained by the first 2 methods, but I think that this one *may* be formalizing the thinking process really cool comedians are going through, but are struggling to explain.

Rest of the article explains the concepts you need to understand to use it and the steps for doing that.

<!-- #### 2 Misdirection. -->

<!-- You can phrase a setup in a way that misleads a person into wrong lanes, creates wrong assumptions. -->

<!-- In this method you basically start with a 2nd lane(the one that the punch line) is based on, and then you come up with a setup that is compatible with it, but strongly suggest a different meaning. -->
