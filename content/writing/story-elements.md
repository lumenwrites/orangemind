Summary: 


When you are writing a story, climax is the key element you are looking for. When you know the climax — you have a story, and until you know it — you don’t.

All the key elements of a story are connected to climax, they add up to it. If you know the climax — you know all of the crucial elements, and in this post I want to point out how that works.

(For convenience I insert here an image of a story structure from my [previous post](https://medium.com/@rayalez/story-structure-5da799745034).)

* **Climax** is a moment where the story’s main **Event** happens, that makes it the most crucial scene. Story is written about the Event, thus **Story=Event = Climax**.

* Climax is a moment when protagonist achieves his **Goal**. That means that if you know the climax — you know the protagonist’s goal, and vice versa. **Climax = Goal.**

* **Inciting Incident** (IInc) is, by definition, the moment when the character acquires his goal. Usually, it is a **problem** created by the **antagonist**, that character will struggle to solve during the whole story, and will finally solve by defeating antagonist at climax. That means if **you know IInc = you know the goal**, and **you know the goal = you know the climax**.

And when you know IInc, goal, and a climax — it is easy to figure out everything else:

* At **Turning Point 1** (TP1) the hero makes a decision to pursue the goal he acquired at IInc and starts on his journey.

* At **Mid Point** hero has a better chance of achieving his goal than going back to the way things were before.

* And at **TP2** hero seems to fail and lose his goal, it is simply the reverse of what happens at climax.

Now **antagonist** is a character who’s function is to prevent hero from achieving his goal by throwing obstacles on his way.

Character’s **friend/sidekick** is a character who’s function is to help hero to achieve his goal(and to be a source of information — to talk to the hero to provide exposition, explain to us what’s going on, render his thoughts, etc.)

**Love interest** is an extra motivation for a hero to achieve his goal, a source of extra complications/conflict, and a *reward* he gets for winning.

Hero’s **internal Flaw** — is a mistake he makes, an internal quality that prevents him from achieving his goal, and creates **internal conflict**.

The **Controlling Idea** (the “moral” of a story) is a **lesson** hero learns by overcoming his internal flaw, the lesson that enables him to defeat the antagonist and achieve his goal.

That way, as you can see, all elements are connected through the **goal** to the story’s **climax**. Any can be *discovered* if you know the climax, and when you know only some of the elements but not all — you can search for climax by following these connections.
