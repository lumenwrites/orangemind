Summary:

What **is** a story? Why is it told? What lies at it’s core?

When the world undergoes *change* from one state to another we call this process an “**Event**”.

The point of storytelling is to relay an **experience** of an event. People listen to stories to gain an experience of (big and important) event, understand it’s reasons, and learn from it.
> ***Story** is a description of an **Event**, and the underlying reasons of that change.*

##Climax

Story consists of *series of smaller events*, leading up to and culminating at **Climax** — the big and important event, the reason for telling a story. Climax is the moment such Event happens.

**Climax** is the key to the story.

When you are writing a story, climax is the biggest thing you are looking for, and the most challenging thing to figure out. Once you know the climax — you have your story, because all of the key story elemnets are connected to it.

##Protagonist

We experience the story throuh the eyes of protagonist, he is our *avatar* into the story world.

Climax is a direct result of a deliberate action by protagonist. Protagonist is a person who had a **goal** and made a **chose** to pursue it. Climax is a moment when protagonist achieves(or fails to achieve) his goal.

As he struggles to pursue his goal, he gains experience. He understands the way the world works and the reasons for that. He learns lessons, and we learn these lessons through him.

##Controlling Idea

Controlling Idea(CI) is the underlying reason for the change that happens, the underlying nature of the world we are trying to explain through story. It is the answer to **why** the event happened.

CI is an **abstract** idea, that is being expressed through **concrete** events and actions.

To put it simply — it is a “moral”, a philosophy that is being expressed. For example, children’s fables are simple metaphors for expressing simple ideas(“lying is bad”, “be nice”, etc).

CI is a “lesson” that protagonist learns about the nature of the world that enables him to accomplish his goal.

Usually, CI is expressed as a flaw that prevents protagonist from achieving his goal, and it is a “lesson” he learns during a story.

*Aside: Technically, I think, CI is a funamental philosophical reason people tell stories — to teach each other things about the world. In practice, stories are being told for a different reason — entertainment. Stories are a way to take people through emotions and fun experiences, a medium for comedy, a reason to snow off a rollercoaster of cool VFX and boobies. More on that later, for now the point is — storytelling is hard enough without philosophy, that is why we keep it simple.*
