**[WP] Describe the romantic relationship between a man in a cave and his last Oreo.**

It has been 1232 since the shipwreck. I did my best to preserve the food that was left, I have learned to hunt, and stretched the last container of sweets for a year, so that I could eat something tasty whenever I miss home the most. But all good things end. I'm down to my last Oreo.

I've looked at her for months, never daring to touch. I talk to her sometimes. I call her Vera.
A week ago somethhing troubling has happened. She started responding. That means that this should end, I should eat her to not descend further into insanity. But I can't, I love her! She is the last thing that reminds me of my humanity.

Today is the day. I cooked meat, started a fire. We sat by the ocean and looked at the stars.
I felt my mouth filling with the suliva, I looked at her more and more often. That was it. I wrapped my mouth around her, in a desperate craving, and I bit. Waves of pleasure spread through my body, I ate and ate. Finally it ended, exhausted and satisfied, I fell on my back, and wept.
