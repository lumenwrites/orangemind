Title: Pigeons of Death
Date: 2015-05-13

Windows shattered and in the next moment the roof was ripped away from the car. The speeding ferrari was lifted 2 meters up into the air, then dropped back to the road, Jack was barely able to handle the steering wheel and to keep moving.

Alice, who was sitting in the passenger seat, dropped now useless guns, and reached under her seat for the bazooka.

4 gigantic pigeons were following the car, weathers burned away from previous explosions, muscles bulging under the bullet-proof skin. They looked like fat and jacked pterodactyls. One of them emitted an angry roar, threw away the roof he was holding in his claws, and dived after the car. At the same time Jack made a sharp turn, so the pigeon missed and smashed into the road.

Jack had no idea what idiot decided to feed pigeons with meat, and that idiot apparently had no idea that the meat was full of steroids. Now it was, as always, on Jack to fix the situation.
He kept driving as Alice launched the rocket at their pack leader....
