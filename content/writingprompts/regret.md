Title: Regret
Date: 2015-06-12

**[WP] When you were younger you murdered 4 people in cold blood. 30 years later you meet the man who confessed and went to prison for your murders.**

"Hello, Vincent."

Vince froze in place, staring in shock at a man who stood in front of his door.

"Hello, father." he looked in the cold blue eyes of a man he hasn't seen for 30 years. "Come in."

"Doctors say I do not have much longer. I've come to say goodby." another shock. Father was always terse and got straight to the point.

"I'm...." *sorry?* Didn't seem like a proportional thing to say.... 

"You did what you thought was right, I did what I thought was right. I don't regret anything. I wish you visited me sometimes, but I understand."

Tears were gathering in his eyes. Vince was haunted by the events of that summer his whole life. He could never bring himself to regret murdering those bastards who killed his sister. Now he knew that his father felt the same way about saving him.
