**[WP] You write a cookbook that brings world peace. What is the third recipe?**

Recepie 3:

To create a super mutated chickenpox potion of doom and power, take a chicken, a brontosaurus' egg, and a turtle. Wait until the sunset on a darkest day of a 3rd moon. Go to the clearing in a deep forest(don't forget your nuclear physics book, wild boar's eyes, photonic crystal semiconductor laser, and, of course, a bald toad). Then, follow the Standard Mad Scientist's Potion Making Instructions from chapter 4.

Caution: Be warned, the side effects may include vomiting, diarrhea,  uncontrollable giggling, jumping on one's leg until collapse of exhaustion, and, in rare cases, love for one's neighbor and peaceful acceptance of life during the last few days of a disease. Potion's effects are highly contagious, don't repeat that at home!
