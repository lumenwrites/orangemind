Title: Pinch Me

**[WP] Your friend tells you "pinch me I'm dreaming". As a joke you do as he asks. He then vanishes afterwards.**

Lucas disappeared, popped out of existence like a soap bubble. Michael panicked.
Does that mean I'm in his dream? *No!* The world around him blurred and twisted for a moment. He saw a tall building crushing down in the distance. Colors grew pale.
*No-no-no-no-no!! I can't let him wake up, everything will disappear!* he thought, but then realized that it is too late. All dreams end, and in a few minutes, by the time Lucas walks to his kitchen to grab a cup of coffee, the remaining memories of this world will be wiped away from his mind.
Michael felt his body losing sharpness and shape, his thoughts getting vague, his vision darkening. At the last moment, he willed a giant dragon into existence, which was strange and weird enough to make the world a little more tangible again.
*Don't wake up, don't wake up!!*

Lucas hit a snooze button and the world was granted 5 more minutes of existence.
