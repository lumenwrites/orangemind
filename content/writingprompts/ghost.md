Title: Ghost
Date: 2015-05-07

**[WP] You die and become a ghost and find out that you have only 24 hours left to do what you never did when you were alive. Problem is, you can't interact with anything or anyone.**

Cold brilliant light of the stars turned into bright streaks of light. At the center of it there was a glowing, unimaginably distant bright dot. Luckily, ghosts have no mass, so David was able to travel at 99.999% of the speed of light. He knew that Alpha Centauri, the closest star to Earth, is 4.3 light years away. He knew that he could not possibly reach it in 24 hours that he had left. He knew that no matter how fast he could go, it would never become visibly bigger or brighter. But he still tried. As he flew through space, he looked at this infintesimally small, inconcieveably distant dot.

He knew that one day humans will reach it. Until then - he will keep trying. He knew that despite the odds, despite the meaninglessness and pain, despite being a hopeless speck of dust speeding through the empty cold space he would keep trying. Humans will always keep trying.
