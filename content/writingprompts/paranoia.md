**[WP] Two really paranoid people meet...**

"Hi, I'm John."

"Hi, John, if that's your real name."

"Of course it's not, I don't know you, why would I give it to you."

"Fair enough, what do you want?"

"Why do you want to know what I want?"

"Why do you want to know why I want to know what you want?"

"Okay, I feel like we're stuck. I'll get to my point - can you tell me what time is it?"

"It's my private information whether I can tell it to you or not. But it's 09:30. Good day sir."

"How do you know my day will gonna be good? Were you following me?"
