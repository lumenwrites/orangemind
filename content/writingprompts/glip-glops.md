**[WP] Describe the most delicious thing ever tasted by anyone and then what ruined it.**

Museum of intergalactic history was filled with visitors from all habitable planets.

"...and this is the photo of the last remaining specimen of Glip-Glops, the species exterminated in a month after they were discovered. Unfortunately for these cute, intelligent, and peaceful creatures, they turned out to be the most delicious thing in the galaxy. Their meat was so tasty that eating it was described as '100 times more joyful than an orgasm' and '10 times more addictive than heroin'. In effort to preserve them, the last one of them is now hidden in a secret place, guarded by robots preventing hundreds of Glip-Glop-addicts from reaching him, while scientists are trying to clone him to restore the species. So far the cloning attempts were unsuccessfull, because all genetic material gets immediately eaten. This is a sad chapter of our history, because now nobody can ever taste the yummy Glip-Glop meat ever again...."
