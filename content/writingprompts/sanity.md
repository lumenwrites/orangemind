Title: Sanity

**[WP] An insane man has a slow and crippling descent into horrible sanity.**

World was becoming more and more restricted, more and more stifling. My thoughts used to run free, with no boundaries, with no restrictions.

Now it felt like walls were constantly appearing in the way of my mind. I was used to think about anything I want, and whatever I imagined was real. I was the god in my universe and now it felt like my powers were taken away from me, every day I could do less and less.

Only a week ago I was living in a space station, I was able to fly and to cast magic. But since then every day, every hour, a piece of a beautiful world I was living in was taken away from me and replaced by a glass wall.

It all started when I had this horrible thought, made this horrible distinction - I thought that some things are real and some are not. 
Only a week ago everything I could imagine was real, but now, since I had this horrible thought, all of my thinking patterns were becoming more and more boring, more and more streamlined.

Fantastic worlds and magic turned into a suffocating, boring, gray apartment. Incredible fantasies were cut away by a horrible idea that some things may not be real.

The hardest thing was losing my friends. I was always happy and surrounded by a company of incredible people whom I loved and who loved me back. But now even they started to disappear. First I stopped seing them but could still hear their voices, then even the voices were gone.

Boring people whom I don't like or even care about are smiling, and reassuring me that I'm making a progress. They don't understand that I'm turning from god into a small, terrified, lonely mortal.
