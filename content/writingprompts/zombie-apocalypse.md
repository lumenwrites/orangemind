Based on [[WP] The zombie apocalypse is here! We've all seen the movies and played the games so we thought we knew what to do. Unfortunately, there's something different about the real zombies that pop culture never prepared us for.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/34otpm/wp_the_zombie_apocalypse_is_here_weve_all_seen/cqwp7nb)

"Please, please don't kill me." cried Alice.

Jack froze in place. He felt cold sweat running down his forehead. He thought he was prepared. He loved watching zombie movies, so when the apocalypse came he was kind of excited. He thought he knew what to do.

But then she got bitten. His only love, the only person that matters to him, after surviving for this long she got bit. He stared at her in a terror.

There was one thing that nobody has expected, that no zombie movie had prepared him for - some remaining part of the zombie's consciousness, triggered by a survival instinct, made them beg for mercy when they were threatened by alive human. Despite being mindless, it came off very realistic and sincere.

This apocalypse had been more swift and merciless than anyone could imagine.

"Please, I love you, don't kill me." said Alice, looking at him with her empty eyes, while slowly but presistently gnawing on his leg.

He couldn't, just couldn't. That was ths end.
