Title: The Cell
Date: 2015-05-03

**[WP] You are trapped in a windowless cell with no one to help you stay alive. It's been 5 days.**

He was hungry and lonely. He was dying of thirst, and suffocating because of the amount of waste there was in the cell. It looked like a small cube, with no windows, no doors, and only one camera staring at him from the wall.

He was living here for several weeks,  and it seemed fine at first. Food used to appear out of thin air from time to time, and the poop he left in the corner disappeared after a couple of hours.
Sometimes a ball appeared, which he could play with, bouncing it off the walls and catching, but it has always disappeared after a few minutes.

But then, food started to appear less and less frequently, and waste piled up in the corner. Lately, it has been 5 days since he had been alone in the cell, hunger and loneliness driving him mad.

Finally, he disappeared as well. Just popped like a soap bubble. In his place, at the center of the cell, appeared a tiny little grave.

Abandoned, in the old shoebox filled with toys, lays Tamagotchi.
