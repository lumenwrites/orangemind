HPMOR:
- Harry vs Twins - pranks comppetition //+More of the cans of comed-tea  
- Harry vs Tracey - rationalist on a love potion
- Harry vs peevez.
- Agents  
  
- Harry vs Dumbledor, over taking control of his money!
- Ron is in love with Hermiony. He knows harry is superior, gives his best to come up with a plan to defeat his evil.
- Harry wants to do experiments on ghosts, they are too proud
- Belka strikes back. Takes Nevill hostage?
- Retreive books from the restricted section
- Broomstick battle and battle where all three generals get assasinated at the beginning
	I want to hear about Draco thinking that between Goyle and himself, it's an easy win for Dragon Army. And then he decides to have Goyle attack Sunshine single-wandedly. I want to hear about how Hermione can barely get off the ground and after 30 seconds of Goyle, Sunshine's chances are all up to Ron Weasley and Susan Bones. Who then decide their only hope is to run toward the Chaos Legion and hope the Chaotics and Dragons will focus on each other until the numbers are more even.

	I want to hear Harry's aerial battle tactics, how Tracy Davis and Theodore Nott gang up on Draco, and how well Finnigan and Thomas fare against the other Dragons. And ultimately, I want it to come down to Harry vs. Goyle pitting training and experience vs. talent, creativity, and intelligence. All while Harry is too distracted to notice that his broom always flies in the direction it's pointed.
- Battle where everyone is for themselves.
- More of the cans of comed-tea

- Nerdy Magician + Pirates
   Nerdy magician kidnapped by pirares, escape-befriend them
   //silicon valley+pirates+prison break
- Character realizes he is in a story
   Writer, extremely genre aware, recognizes he got into a story.  
   Uses it as a power, predicts stuff, argues with a narrator.
   //californication(cocky dickhead writer)+LOTR

   Like "wait, that can't happen! Even if magic is real, this part is
   just a cliche, it dkesnt make sense! I'm in a story!!"
   "narrator: and trolls blasted into the building
   - hey, why'd you do that to me, dickhead? x and y is why you
   never do that in a story.
   narrator: oh, nevermind then, okay, trolls don't blast into the 
   building.
   haha, maybe narrator gets even angry and dumps bucket onto 
   a character's head or something"
- MIB for paranormal.
   MIB+ fringe(paranormal scientists) Comedy. World where werewolves/magic/
   etc are real, and agents have to deal with it.

   stray werewolves!! Not HP world, or maybe heck, maybe HP!!    
   Imagine US agents who are aware of magic.

* De-bono
Topic/area/niche > breakdown, concrete
  
** Focus/Creative pause:
- ask a question nobody has asked before
- pick a random thing and decide to challenge/improve it.  
   
- Boring mediocre cliches/default assumptions.
- Things to improve, problems to solve.
- challenge everything and ask why?
   
** Challenge:
- General "new ideas in the area x"
- Improve "How to improve x?"
- Solve. What's wrong with it?
  Solve problem "Is there a problem? How can I solve it?"
- DBC - Why are we doing it this way? Better way?
- Drop/escape it - what would we do without it?
  Alternatives?
â€“ Achieve  

** Jump:
Goal - create:
crazy/very-not-true/wrong/over-the-top/wide-gap
(comic reality? Looking for crazy.)

- Reversal
- Exaggeration
- Random
- Reorder
- Connect to field
- Perspective (Max angle)
- Straightforward
  

** Move: //~crazy association?? by seriously thinking on crazy stuff??
Goal - create/find crazy/new
connection/association/reinterpretation/alternative
by seriously thinking on crazy stuff.
(Rationally explain the insane thing, and this is how you find a conector??)

- Positive aspect
- Difference
- Imagine
- Situation in which it could be useful
  
** Types of connectors
- Explanation
- Outcome
- Behavior
- Reaction
- Interpretation
- Assumption
- My opinion
- Meaning(word/phrase)
//metaphor  
  
** Tools  
- Breakdown
  Find a concrete
- Branch away on different levels
- List of 5 things
- Find the core, get rid of fluff.

- Connector(on multiple levels) > Alternatives!! //> exaggerate the gap
- Jump(crazy) > Move(seriously thinking on crazy stuff, finding an association)  

Once you've got new idea - unfold/essay.

** Comedy
//General vibe(maybe sometimes has something to do with):

- crazy/very-not-true/wrong/over-the-top/wide-gap
- connection/association/reinterpretation/alternative
- seriously think on crazy stuff.
- break/defeat/shatter the pattern/assumption/expectation
- wrong prediction/expectation/assumption
quick deletion of a false version/old-pattern
detect mistaken reasoning
