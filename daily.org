Harry was sitting at the Ravenclaw table when black haired girl came up to him.

Kyle jumped to the right, dodging the bite of a mutated rat.
His crowbar, covered in what was left of his previous enemies, was shaking in his hands.
Right behind him was a narrow river with ominously looking black water.
In front of him, as far as the eye could see, were the lifeless postapocaliptic wastelands.
Well, almost lifeless.
Between him and his home - only visible as a dim shape of several hills in the distance -
was a group of nuclear rats. Group or a pack? Or a pride?
Very soon they would be nothing. Because 3 rats were already lying on the ground lifeless,
and the remaining 4 were looking more and more hesitant to attack.

Rats were pretty useless, clever animals, but too aggressive.
Despite Kyle's attempts, the project of domesticating these creatures hasn't been a very successfull one.
